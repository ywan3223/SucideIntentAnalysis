,SuicideWatch,"I’ve posted here before in my previous attempts, and luckily, I made it out safe, know that I do want to at least try to live beyond 30. That still doesn’t stop my mind from going there often.

This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. 

Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. 

My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.  And there’s the fact that a grandchild from my brother is coming, and I can’t help but think this is the sign. This is the chance for me to talk my leave. But I understand that just offing myself is going to hurt my family and one friend so much.

So here’s where I’m at: i have a half-thought out plan. I REALLY DON’T want to die, but the mental pain is so unbearable i don’t know how to control. Telling my family and friend about this is only going to make me feel guilty/worse. I work as a para at a high school in Texas and have maybe one sick day left. I’m waiting till my contract is out and then I’ll formally quit and look for other opportunities. 

I’m considering going to a mental hospital to check myself in so I don’t actually go through it. Would I be fired if they found out/have to tell them if I stay there for longer than expected? How does it usually go when checking yourself in for suicidal thoughts from anyone’s experience (from TX would really help)? Researching has only given me vague answers and I don’t know if I’ll just lose my job/paycheck because I’m scared. How do I even tell my mom that I’m driving myself to a clinic because I’m scared I might run off and die without giving her a panic attack? 

I’m waiting till a few hours from now to decide my next action. Maybe these thoughts will go away by them, but future reference may help me later if it ever comes up again.

I do want to live, but I’m scared of myself.",t2_55tjwpat,False,,0,False,Been depressed for a while. Chronically suicidal all week. What should I do to get immediate help?,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,True,t3_tt7gkg,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648754525.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve posted here before in my previous attempts, and luckily, I made it out safe, know that I do want to at least try to live beyond 30. That still doesn’t stop my mind from going there often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.  And there’s the fact that a grandchild from my brother is coming, and I can’t help but think this is the sign. This is the chance for me to talk my leave. But I understand that just offing myself is going to hurt my family and one friend so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s where I’m at: i have a half-thought out plan. I REALLY DON’T want to die, but the mental pain is so unbearable i don’t know how to control. Telling my family and friend about this is only going to make me feel guilty/worse. I work as a para at a high school in Texas and have maybe one sick day left. I’m waiting till my contract is out and then I’ll formally quit and look for other opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m considering going to a mental hospital to check myself in so I don’t actually go through it. Would I be fired if they found out/have to tell them if I stay there for longer than expected? How does it usually go when checking yourself in for suicidal thoughts from anyone’s experience (from TX would really help)? Researching has only given me vague answers and I don’t know if I’ll just lose my job/paycheck because I’m scared. How do I even tell my mom that I’m driving myself to a clinic because I’m scared I might run off and die without giving her a panic attack? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m waiting till a few hours from now to decide my next action. Maybe these thoughts will go away by them, but future reference may help me later if it ever comes up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to live, but I’m scared of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, thanks for reading. I know this is not an advice sub but I desperately need some from a stranger. Any really.

(post below)

Not sure if I was sexually coerced abroad (19m), think I have an STD - may have passed it onto my girlfriend (20). Please help.

I’ll just start with the fact that this is probably the most difficult thing that has happened to me in my life. I have had nightmares for two weeks since the event and I can’t get any sleep; my daylight hours are consumed with guilt and I am seriously considering suicide. (Have written a note, and made a rough timeframe).

I was recently on holiday in Havana, and was searching for food alone around 1am, very intoxicated. For those who know Havana - there is a street where prostitutes hang out, unfortunately its one of the only places you can get a pizza that late. Here is where it gets blurry - I remember walking back to my apartment and being approached by three prostitutes. They brought me to someones bed (not mine) where i remember receiving fellatio (cant remember if there was a condom). I remember having an erection but being unable to finish. I barely remember getting home, but I still had my phone and wallet but when I checked in the morning my wallet was missing all its cash (around 60 euros).

I’m not sure it was not consensual. I did not report the event to police because i’m not sure 1) they would do anything 2) I have desperately tried to forget it ever happened. I love my girlfriend more than anyone in the world and tried to forget it happened but I cannot. She means so much to me and I’d never thought of cheating before but I just can’t remember my thought process no matter how many times I relive it. I’m so scared that I consented. I know that I’m responsible for the actions of drunk me.

Recently my testicles have started itching more than usual and sometimes it stings slightly to pee (no redness). I have had sex with my girlfriend within the time I got back (with a condom vaginally, but not orally) as I didn’t want her to know what happened and think I cheated. I feel really really awful knowing that I could have passed this disease on to her and all I want is for her to be alright. To me suicide seems like the only plausible way out, as I can’t see myself living life without her and this will undoubtedly fundamentally change how she sees me.

,SuicideWatch,"Like a lot of you, I'm very lonely. 

Lonely enough that, lately, I've been taking walks to try and get my mind off things a bit. It's helping a little, and getting out there and just walking for miles and miles has been something to look forward to now for the first time in a long time. 

Thing is, there's a bridge that I like to stop at and rest. Every time I walk into it, and I stop, and I look down, I think about how easy it would be to just jump off into the water and be done with it all. It's high enough that it would definitely kill me. 

This morning, right as the sun was first starting to peek out, I started off on my walk. When I got to the bridge, I stopped for way too long - an hour maybe. After a while, it went from ""Maybe it might be okay"", to ""I'm sure it wouldn't be that bad"", to ""It would be over before you knew what hit you"". 

Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I'm getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. 

I've been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. 

I'm finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. 

I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. 

Now, as I write all this down, and I'm getting progressively more drunk, I'm getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, _really_ good inside.",t2_id929kuo,False,,0,False,I'm starting to be less and less scared that I'm not scared at all,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tt4jt5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648746652.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of you, I&amp;#39;m very lonely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I&amp;#39;m getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I write all this down, and I&amp;#39;m getting progressively more drunk, I&amp;#39;m getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good inside.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"TW: // h*mophobia, mention of getting st@bbed.

I'm just going through really hard time. I don't even know what to say about it. 

But yesterday i felt really suicidal. I never felt this much of suicidal before. 

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD-C, and everything made sense in life. But my parents are still not understanding about how mentally tolling it can be. I told my parents that have been feeling burnout for past 9 months and they just seem to take it lightly. I was in depression, and always had chronic anxiety issues which were all fueled by my untreated and undetected ADHD for all these years. 

My parents are actually really nice and always encourage me to open up, but it's all stupid because they end up blaming me for not trying harder. My anxiety which I had since I was kid always made it difficult for me to have friends. I do not even have siblings to share stuff with. 

I cannot share or talk about my problems that are actually troubling me to my parents with complete honesty because they don't understand and end up telling me to fix my schedule or some stupid shit that definitely wouldn't work for adhd minds. 
Because of that i atleast try to gain comfort from them by talking about other stuff that gives me pleasure like talking about favourite serie or charecter, but they ALWAYS tell me that I'm getting distracted again, and that should delete my Social media and stuff. 

Also yesterday, i asked my mom if, she  would accompany to pride parade if that happened in our city. And she started nagging, ""i told you to delete Instagram, you are supposed to study,.... Delete that rn!"" which clearly shows that she was trying to avoid that talk. So I'm really not left with a space where can talk about anything comfortably with them. The fact that she is internally h*mophobic puts me through so much stress. And everytime I talk about something deep, it always ends up with her telling me to study. I teared up. My dad, is mostly unavailable at home because of his work, all we do is little chit chat. And never had a chance to talk deeply about my personal issues, like i can do with my mom (who's housewife) even tho that doesn't end up well. 

Since I took an academic gap year, all my friends already promoted to next year's classes, left city and i have completely lost contact with them. Its been two years since i haven't really went outside to fresh my mind and enjoy myself. I can't do that, because my parents don't allow me to go anywhere alone and I don't even have a valid reason to.

Also I'm realising that even tho my parents have been always nice to me, they are always restricting my freedom. I'm F18 for godsake, and i still don't have control over my decisions. They are mostly made on my behalf by my mom. I can't even recharge my Mobile plans, i have to ask my mom every time to do it. And she would always excuse that ""it's waste of money use wifi instead"" and say ""you don't call or get calls from your friends anyway"". Like, sure wifi works but that'd mean i can't really go outside since i struggle with anxiety and always need music to cope. I don't even know details of my own band acc or cards, and so I can't do something on my own without asking my parents about it. This all might sound ridiculous but i really don't know any other way to cope. 


And so my coping options were reduced to my alone time in my room which helps me organise my intrusive thoughts, nice people on instagram, reddit forums and music. 


But yesterday, these all were breached. My parents are not emotionally supportive, unsafe to confide in and almost indifferent to my ADHD situation even tho they atleast provide with meds. I'm not on therapys. I do not have friends. My mom's homophobic undertone when i tried to seek least bit of comfort is just so hurtful. The wifi wasn't working well and my mom refused to recharge my phone, which meant no music, reddit or Instagram which gives me best comfort space i can afford.  And my parents intruded in my personal space yesterday which is crucial to me especially when i feel unstable and wanted to write my thoughts down privately. 

I went to bathroom and cried. And next thing that came to my mind was to go upstairs on terrace and then kiss the ground. Right before when i slept at 4:45am (i have very shitty sleep schedule bec of my adhd) i saw a flash in head where someone st@bbed me in my stomach and then hugged me, and i felt great and said ""thank you, this feels awesome"". I was kinda horrified and mad at myself for having such stupid intrusive thought. I woke up late today at 11am,  and was veryy tired and felt like i would collapse any second. Slept for another 2½ hours and saw a dream where i told my mom to kill me. And then she got mad at me for always talking about negetive stuff. I woke up feeling half dead. 

So yeah this all happened. And- idek where am I supposed to go.. .

I also got kicked out of college, no way I can turn back.



I've been a burden to my mother and my father. I've infected them with my depression they were unable to heal. I know my death my hurt them, but it will be better for them in the long run. Just like pouring alcohol on an infected wound, it will hurt really badly first, but it will heal it in the long run.


I have no friends left, I've tried for 4 years, only one. And she was more than I could ever ask. But she's gone, because I fucked up. I squeezed her to the point that she left, I don't blame her. I loved her, she was my best friend. And she was the first and only person to say that to me, ""I love you bestie"". Now, she blocked me, she was my last thing I tried living for. She's gone. I have her all I had, and she gave me what I want, what I needed. Now, she's gone. If you see this BB, it's not your fault. Please don't blame my disappeance or death on yourself. It isn't, you held me together, like you held me in your arms a few days ago before you left. You were the best thing that happened to me, and those best memories that I've had with you will be the last thing I will remember before my death. Though I'm not sure if you still love me after what I did, I still did.


Today was the first time I felt grief. I thought I did before, but, the pain I felt today, was nothing like anything I felt. Felt worse than waking up after my surgery after the anesthesia technician forgot to give me morphine. It felt worse than when the needle hit my nerve during a blood draw.
I felt the true meaning of a heart break. I thought it was a metaphor, or an exaggeration. But, it wasn't. I felt the grief in my chest, my breaths felt empty. My heartbeat felt unreal. The pain, the chest pain when I was crying. I didn't know that could happen.


I've decided to go missing today, run away from my parents, find a hotel far away spend my last days drinking and eating my favourite food, then finding erernal peace.


I appreciate if you want to convince me otherwise, but I've already decided. I don't want anything better, I just want my friend back, and maybe build my life. But, that's impossible. I've tried therapy, medications, groups, suicide lines. Nothing can fix it.

If you want to help. I'd love if someone could comfort me through my last days here, I always felt scared being alone. Id prefer if I didn't die lonely. Someone I could talk about my happiest memories, my biggest regrets. My deepest secrets. I plan on dying on Monday, if not anything early if they find me.

I think I fought bravely. I endured unimaginable hardships. But sadly it wasn't enough. There is nothing to run or fight from. And nothing to surrender to. So, it's best I cease.

I just want to say thankyou for helping me today, ive been really stupid and was planning on ending my life, even going as far as to enquire on r/heroin about how much I'd need for an overdose. Kind of ironic to be born into this world on such a drug only to leave on the same thing.

But after speaking with people there, here and my partner in Hungary. Something in me changed, I realized that all of this internalised pain and suffering. Was keeping me from progressing forward, while that sounds like a no-brainer. At the time it didn't quite register, that said this isn't what changed my mind.

Ive been quite irritable with my partner lately and have been pretty nasty and awful towards her, it was this coupled with the fact that I just need to keep busy and maybe have a hobby that finally made me see sense. Yes im still facing the same problems as before, the same fears and the same struggles. But now im ready to face them instead of running away.

im so cripplingly lonely. i went to go visit my family for a couple weeks and got to feel real love and care for me from my family. it felt so weird being hugged and talked to. now im back in this neglectful prison where i just sit here to rot. 

ive started cutting and ive been hitting myself on the head a lot. i spend all day just wracked with sobs for days on end. i hate myself so much. 

ive been ill all my life and i cant take it anymore. its ruined me beyond repair. i was abused badly as a kid and it took away any ability to lead a normal life. I hate who i am. 

i ruined my relationship with my ex and best friend of 7 years because i was terrified she'd abandon me like i always was. i hurt her so much. i will never forgive myself for that. I never meant to hurt her and i care about her so deeply. she meant to world to me and still does but i fucked it up. i love her so so much and want it to go back to normal but shes moved on. 

she treats me like im nothing now nd doesn't even want to see me. i miss when she was excited to talk to me and we were happy. i miss her so much even though i talk to her everyday. it doesnt feel like im talking to her it feels like im talking to a stranger. 

i want her to take me back so bad, doesn't even have to be romantically i just want to talk to my best friend again. 

i love her so much still and im so confused and hurt. im trying so hard to keep our friendship together but shes going to get tired eventually and then ill really be alone. 

my friends dont respond to me, they dont text me first, dont want to do anything with me. i get left on read asking to do things. none of them are irl by the way, i havent had a friend irl in years. 

i feel like a zoo animal pacing its cage. i cant take it anymore. i want to numb it all so bad but i cant. my post makes it sound like my only issue here is loneliness but it isnt, ive had to deal with such a crushing amount of issues my whole life but the loneliness is whats finally doing me in. 

I feel like i cant be alone or im going to finally do it. 

i just want somebody to hold me and tell me itll be okay. i want this all to end. i want to go back to my good family and feel like i have any presence at all to anyone. i want my dad to hug me and to tell him everything and to finally be at peace. i cant be left alone anymore. 

i dont know if i want to die. thats better than having a plan though. I first attempted at 10, again at 13. i just want to numb it all but i cant. i want to bash my head in because thats the only way i can stop this. whenever i get like this all i want to do is hit my head until it stops and sometimes thats what i do

In short, I never received any form of understanding for what I went through from my parents &amp; now my mom is saying that I need to stop victimizing myself because she went through worse being born as an unplanned child &amp; was neglected &amp; by her mother. Well, what the fuck though? Why... why did someone like my mom, who will probably never get proper treatment decided to have children? Fuck you, mom. Fuck you. 

Now my mom has been lecturing me of how my teachers have told her I have no drive &amp; passion in school. Well, what the hell do you expect to come out though from complaining about that? I don't understand. It's just so draining to work so hard for something I don't even care about. It doesn't help that my mom would nag about how she had the best scores in university but is currently only a housewife married to someone who had parents who treated her terribly. What a miserable life despite all the hard work.

My self esteem issues are honestly so bad, they were even worse when I was younger. I would constantly stutter &amp; would eat my lunch in the toilet during lunch times in fear of having to interact with other people.

Honestly, I'm just feeling horrible right now, crying about how my life is going to start going downhill after I graduate. My parents (my mom in particular) is constantly complaining about how I'm not trying hard (I'm not denying that) &amp; how life will be harder, that I'm too relaxed for someone who hasn't been trying hard enough to apply to universities. But what is the point when my parents don't really support me in my own choices? I don't feel like I have control over my own life anyway.

Sorry for the long post and I’m kind of new to this so I don’t know how to do the whole TL;DR thing, I’m sorry. 

Btw I know I’ve posted this a bunch of times and this will be the last. The reason I’m posting this more recently was that I was ashamed to admit that I started doing this again but then realized my career choice, so yea sorry for the multiple posts. 

Ok, first of all, I know that this isn’t an excuse or anything but because of the pandemic, online learning, and other stuff, I just kind of got bored and lonely and I guess I just started going on Reddit looking for something fun and found these NSFW SubReddits and people messaging me, I don’t know honestly, I was just bored and lonely. I never had any friends in school (and still don’t and get bullied quite often and never stand up for myself) because I’m shy and just overall weird and different from other people (bisexual even though no one knows I just feel different that I like men and women), and I absolutely hate my parents, we don’t agree on anything ever, they’re always in my space, constantly putting pressure on me, and I hate when they say racist and homophobic things (and I can’t stand up for myself because all of a sudden I have no voice and an attitude problem). I understand that they want me to do good in school and life but I just, I just can’t stand them. So basically what I did was I started talking to these people on Reddit, lying to them about basically everything (Age, sex, etc)  (I never gave any of my personal info btw) and what I feel the most shittiest about is that I sometimes received pics and sent pictures of other people from other SubReddits and said they were mine. I realized that what I was doing was wrong and really disgusting, so I got rid of that account, but a couple months ago I found what I wanted to be in life and when I grow up and that is a FBI Special Agent (I know I have to get US citizenship and denounce my Canadian one, and I’m aware of the other requirements), but I feel like I did something illegal, and I’ve also heard they ask that question in the polygraph. I also feel like I’ve ruined everyone that I talked to lives as well by lying to them that I’m an adult when I’m younger than 18. I’m afraid this will affect my future and career aspiration. I have deleted everything, but still, I just, can’t live with myself. At night I just think that if I end it, my family would have less of a burden, I don’t have to think about this, and I can start over.

My brother 18 years old is just like my sister but worse. He calls me a men toucher on a daily basis he also says I watch cp when I obviously don’t……..
He’s a high school drop out and he is also jobless and he is obese… not only is he jobless he always steals money from my mom and he makes her cry every night. He used my moms debit card without her permission to buy a 800$+ phone… not only did he do those things without apologizing he takes my mom car at night like 2 am and comes back at 7 and that gets my mom really stressed she can’t even sleep at night without fearing that her money or car would get taken, one day he left without my moms permission with her car and guess what he crashed my moms 9k$ car and now he’s demanding her to buy a new one…… He went out of the city with a G3 license and now he got his license suspended and now my mom has to pay 4 grand just to get it back, he’s not even working to fix his mistake. 

He and my sister are incredibly passive aggressive even when I’m not even in the same room as them they insult me, they talk out loud without a care in the world so I could easily hair them, they even backbite constantly they always say I’m garbage I’m useless I’m this and I’m that and I’m tired of it all I’m tired of the constant bullying I’m tired of them always trying to make me the bad guy….

I’m just a 15 year old Male trying to focus on my studies and life but their constant bullying makes it incredibly hard for me to just live normally I have contemplated suicide multiple times but I can’t even do that because in my religion (Islam) suicide is a really serious major sin, I just want them to stop bullying me constantly I just want to live a decent life…… I’m just tired of it all.

If anybodies asking about my mom well she works a 11 To 8 PM job so she can’t really help me from the bullying but whenever she is home she helps but she’s a diabetic 40 year old that’s struggling to even walk properly so I don’t want to stress her anymore because of my suicidal thoughts..

My older brother drops me off at school and he picks me up a hour or 2 when school ends and what makes it difficult is that he forces me to walk to a bank or kfc for no reason whatsoever, when he picks me up with my sister he just becomes a complete jerk he wouldn’t let me enter the car that day I was so pissed I just gave up and walked 1 hour+ home and my mom was at work and there was nothing she could do.

But no follow up or treatment was given, although to be honest...after three years of being left unchecked and untreated, going round and round in circles with professionals who make excuses as to why they can't help you. Id had enough.

Two years ago I lost my best friend to suicide, she was in the room next to me as she was overdosing. There was nothing I could do to stop her. Five days following her being put on life support, she died. She was someone who once talked me off the ledge, but she still took her life. Now I want to do the same. As a Trans-woman, I constantly feel like the world hates me. Like they see me as a parisite or something thats subhuman.

More and more people are starting to see people like me as degenerate, but all I wanted to do was live my life. I don't impose my choices onto others, nor demand anyone use my pronouns. I have my own rules but expect no one else to live by them, its a really peaceful way to be. If we all lived like this, the world would be just as peaceful too. On the subject of peace, let me tell you about mine.

Anytime I've decided (truly decided) to go ahead with making preparations to end my life, an overwhelming sense of serenity and peace washes over me. Its the happiest feeling ive had since I was 6 years old and im 32 now. People have told me time after time to get help, and trust me ive really tried. The sad reality is, the mental health services in my area are under funded, under staffed and can only treat those most in need.

That being said many whom I've met have no emotional understanding of you, some of them are even downright abusive towards you. And can I prove it? No. And that's how they get away with this. Needless to say, im not looking for help. I simply came here to tell you how I feel. Because id rather have 6 months to a few years happiness than 3 more decades of misery. 

But suicide is no easy task, especially for those who I'm about to hurt. That being said, the human heart has an amazing capacity to heal, my friends and what little family I have left will heal with time. They will move on and find a way to live with what I did, that's just how human beings are.

I'm sorry this post was morbid, in a way I feel better for saying it. But I want you to bear something in mind before attempting to talk me down. In a recent episode of Doctor who aired in 2020. The Doctor asks the master...

""And has it calmed all the rage?"" 

The master replies...

I  was about to end my life and no idea why I didn't pull the trigger. 3  nights ago, I got drunk off my rear end. had a gun to my head and should  have pulled the trigger but didn't. just sat there shaking and bawling  to no end for hours.

I struggle  with C-PTSD, Severe Chronic Depression, Severe social anxiety, Paranoia,  adhd, minor brain damage and tons of other issues.

I  am 41, on disability, SSI to be exact got into streaming games online  for extra money but was told by SSI they consider it work and if I keep  pushing it, I will lose my SSI even though I don't make that much if  anything at all doing it.

I am  being sued by the housing authority for the apartments we live in for  mistakes that the landlords and managers made years ago and the housing  authority don't care. I rent a bedroom from my aunt and her son who  treat me horribly and abuse me and take advantage of me.

I  have 3 credit cards all 3 over the balance of 500 dollars. I am in a  total debt of 9.6k because of the 9k I am being sued for and the 500  plus on each credit card.

I bought a car a few years ago that was supposed to help me change my life only for the fact that I got scammed.

I  am also physically disabled now due to having arthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis in my lower back, knees, feet. meds sometimes don't help and  working out doesn't help one bit either.

I  have spent 10 years homeless and have had a family that severely  neglected me from the age of 5 and up. lost both parents in my early  20's. have no siblings or other family but my aunt and her son who treat  me horrible.

I have tried for the  past 10 years to get my own apartment based on income, find a room to  rent I could afford,, get a minivan to live in, to find a job I could  even online. but to no avail, only to get let down, rejected, mocked at,  made fun of etc. I am now in my 40's and all the work I have done in my  early 20's and 30's were just day labor cash under the table.

I  have never had a real job and at this point probably wouldn't even be  able to handle it because of my mental issues. It has been over 10 yrs  since I was last hugged, held, had anyone tell me they loved me even if  they didn't mean it.

I am so tired  of being alone and being single and never having been loved or have  affection and watching everyone else live the lives I dearly want to  live but can't acquire no matter how hard I try.

I  just wish I pulled the trigger 3 nights ago and ended it. I have  nothing left and at this point if anyone came into my life, I would  probably smother them with affection, love, touches, etc to the point  they would run away as fast as they came in to my life.

My mom didnt push me out so i would just push myself into the dirt. I accept that life is out control. Life is disgusting. The earth is filthy. I am filthy. Everyone is a damn sinner. But that doesnt mean I just have to sit here and take it like a hoe is smashen me wit a strapon. I have little power over my life, but damn it, Im gonna use that power for whatever good i can. Im gonna use that power for the almighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I get outta this and get straight with my fam, by golly gee willickers, I am gonna help all these homeless peoples out, all these depressed peoples and suicidal peoples, all these poor peoples, all these people looking for god peoples, all these peoples that strugglen like I am peoples. I hate hedonist. People who dedicate their life to pleasure. I used to do that. It helps with the pain doesnt it? but that demon of depression and hoplessness always gon stick they finger in my asshole, but rn, that demon just got MY FINGER in they asshole. And im gon wiggle that finger until that hoe is bleeden like a mf gore video. Im gonna conqueren this bitchass demon. God (or myself idk) didnt spawn this dumb demon in my life just so i would run off scared and afraid. Life is like clocken in at yo job. I was born to do my job. and that mf job is to help all the other mf people on this filthy musty ass planet, not to pursue pleasure or some other bullshit reason. I gotta job to do until the day I die and if that day be tommorow i dont give a freak. Imma die with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonder:   noun. &lt;strong&gt;the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone goin through this poo poo ass life. Movies and fictional stories are lies. Life is a fatboy that wants to eat you up and let the stomach acid burn you for its pleasure. BUT NAW, FUCK THAT FATBOY. IM GON KILL THAT FATBOY OF PAIN AND LIVE THE LIFE GOD DESIRES FOR ME TO LIVE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know. That demon is gonna come back and shove its finger up my asshole again, but I will karate-kid jutsu spin attack and shove my finger up they butthole, and im gonna keep moven for the good of my brothers and sisters on this earth (hell).&lt;/p&gt;

at 17 after graduating from highschool i enlisted in the us army to pay four college. two combat tours later im med boarded and 5-17 after i shot a child in the head (on orders) and from there its mostly blurr.

since then I've done okay. i'm a functional member of society, i work hard to just keep my self occupied and my hands busy but the longer everything goes on i just find less and less to live for. i just  read about ny cutting funding to children and family and honestly this hurt the most. i spent most of my child hood fighting just too eat and now more children will be worse off? its just hard to watch all of this and know that everything ive ever done has only hurt more people and more like me are suffering even more.

,SuicideWatch,"It has been an utter waste of effort and time. Everything has completely collapsed, yet even now, I hesitate. In the process of the one action that may bring me solace, I continue to struggle. What purpose has my life served? I fail to comprehend how this existence serves as nothing more than a futile attempt at fulfilling goals that I have never even longed for. There has never been a principle in my life as concrete as the absence of meaningful thought in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

There is nothing to rationalize. Failure is failure. It has done nothing for me but unearth a suicidal ideation rooted within me. I ruminate continuously the impetus of my existence, yet the question itself leaves me more dumbfounded than I have ever been regarding the true nature of my being. Why is it that I wish so incessantly for death? Why is it that I demand mercy even from God, rather than carrying out my “Salvation” through my own means?

&amp;#x200B;

Has my desire for nonexistence gained such a control over me that I demand it of a supreme being whose presence is less certain than my own? How pathetic of a mind I possess! Rather, I am the mind which I loathe so greatly for imbuing every waking second of my life with an unshakable misery. I am the consciousness. How can I even begin to deflect the blame? Surely, my condition is not a product of my environment. It is simply a direct result of a fundamental flaw in my being. I am what is wrong with me. There is nothing else that can be so directly attributed as the cause to my despair. It is so.

It is better for me to do nothing at all. Nothing can cure this disease… no, this feature of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the alternative to doing nothing is becoming nothing. At the very least, it provides the possibility of an escape. An outlet for my suffering. Though it is uncertain to me whether or not death will bring an end to these thoughts, I am so agonizingly desperate for a reprieve that I will willingly attempt to find it through irreversible means.

Everything has completely collapsed, yet even now, I hesitate. In the process of the one action that may bring me solace, I continue to struggle. What purpose has my life served? I fail to comprehend how this existence serves as nothing more than a futile attempt at fulfilling goals that I have never even longed for. There has never been a principle in my life as concrete as the absence of meaningful thought in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing to rationalize. Failure is failure. It has done nothing for me but unearth a suicidal ideation rooted within me. I ruminate continuously the impetus of my existence, yet the question itself leaves me more dumbfounded than I have ever been regarding the true nature of my being. Why is it that I wish so incessantly for death? Why is it that I demand mercy even from God, rather than carrying out my “Salvation” through my own means?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has my desire for nonexistence gained such a control over me that I demand it of a supreme being whose presence is less certain than my own? How pathetic of a mind I possess! Rather, I am the mind which I loathe so greatly for imbuing every waking second of my life with an unshakable misery. I am the consciousness. How can I even begin to deflect the blame? Surely, my condition is not a product of my environment. It is simply a direct result of a fundamental flaw in my being. I am what is wrong with me. There is nothing else that can be so directly attributed as the cause to my despair. It is so.&lt;/p&gt;

I avoid tech club because everyone always asks if I'm okay, but when I say no they walk away. I don't blame them though, I wouldn't want to have to deal with me either.

Ive had 3 heart caths. 
Every single time I build up a life, sickness primarily interrupts and it's taken away. 
Last August, I had the bad covid pneumonia. I was living at home with my mother and grandmother. I couldn't eat or sleep for 2 weeks straight. I went to the er 8 times because of the pain. I didnt get my first breathing treatment until third week of August and it was only.because my mom decided to take me to an out of town hospital. But to make a long story short, it was mid sept before I was ok again. 
I ended up having the chance to move in with my best friend 3 hours away so I did. Finally got a job making money. Everything was going fine.

My friend went to his family and I went to mine to visit. The first night I took 60mg of zanaflex. It helps me sleep. I woke up at 5am. I went to get my phone. But there was a wooden dresser between me and my night stand. So I stood up, walked to my bedroom.door. tried to open it. There was no door knob. It was not there. There was a wooden boards on the crease of it. I remember panicking. So I turn around and om trying to turn the light on and couldn't touch the strings bc they were constantly moving from me. Then a white pew with a red cushion comes out. I try to get over it but I couldn't. So I just sat down on it and just prayed to Jesus. I got up and suddenly I could open my bedroom.door again. I never ever experienced something so real like that. It scared me. But things got worse after that. The days ahead my blood pressure was 80/60 and heart rate was 35 to 40 bpm. For days. Every time I tried to get up and walk, i had this dizzy feeling like I was gonna pass out. One time.i did fall. Finally one Wednesday night my mom takes me to the er.

I&amp;#39;m just tired. My father and grandma both died at 45 for heart issues. I wonder if I&amp;#39;ll ever make it to 45. I feel like I&amp;#39;m just late. I see people way younger than me that&amp;#39;s married and got a good job and good money and I have nothing. I feel like im.just a burden on everyone. I dont know what to do. I&amp;#39;m tired of struggling. I just lay in bed one day to the next. Those who I thought would be there for.me isnt there. No one cares about me. Maybe I should.give up.&lt;/p&gt;

As of 48 hours ago, everything was perfect. My pregnant wife of 8 months is healthy and doing great, I support her entirely. She moved from home to see the world with me and begin a great life of adventure. We have been married for just a year and 2 months today. She is my best friend and my sole partner. We have a rainbow child (a baby girl) on the way and I already love her just as much as my wife, if not, more. My family is so proud of me after how much I've done to build a good home.

However, just yesterday I was escorted without a clue to an office and was interrogated. Now, at first I had no idea what was going on. My supervisor who escorted me had no idea.

,SuicideWatch,"This is the sentence at the start of a rant that nobody will read or care about. I'm still in highschool even though I'm 21 because my mind never left 2017. I never left 2017 because that was the last time that a group of people gave enough of a shit to me to pretend to welcome me into their friend group and treat me as if I could be a normal functioning member of society. But in the words of my good ex-friend I poison everything I get to and I'm a shitty person with a shitty personality. No, they obviously didn't keep me around. I was too much of them to handle because I've been thinking of one thing since the 3rd grade. Before I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I knew I wanted to be dead. Before I knew I wanted to be dead, I knew that people didn't like me around. It's not that I wasn't charming or nice or funny or intelligent. No, I was all of those things. But I was also very weird and strange and scary. I scared the love right out of them like now I do with everyone. 

Everyone gets sad, right? But not me, I get too sad. I get sad for years: stalk and scream at people and call them names, break things, say I'm gonna kill myself, and leave the other person wondering when I'll say that it's them I want to kill.

Some people who have met me have thought that I was the coolest guy in the universe: destined for greatness, full of infinite potential with an unbreakable will. That is until I scared that feeling out of them. They're left wondering ""what the fuck did I just see happen?"". Thankfully, these people who've shared such intimacies with me all share a condition which allows them to compartmentalize the fact that they never really knew me. Then where there once was a connection, a cold towering metal wall emerges. 

I wake up to a house of bones where there is no other soul to cling to, and no one that I can pour myself into. I go through a day in a desolate but comfortable prison filled with anything I could ever possibly want but not a soul in site. Through the glowing of screens I encounter thousands of towering cold walls concealing souls that I could never attain. I try to pour myself into them, but I spill myself down the ditch into the gutter and back to the sewer where I belong.

I return to my slumber to dream of faint memories of a time once lost. Warm soothing feelings. Having my face touched and my hair stroked and holding an angels head in my arms. Holding that angel tightly trying to stop his tears from flowing. 

But nothing stops them from flowing and he pulls his hand away from mine and I feel his scorn as he shoves me away, tells me that I didn't hold him tight enough, that I was too late, that I didn't cry for him enough. 

I run out after him with my arms wide open but I'm greeted by a tower of cold, harsh, lifeless metal. The person who I used to entangle my soul with is in the arms of another.

There's no use running after them, and there's no use screaming because no one can hear underwater.

Sometimes a warmth that glows like the sun merely leads to a heart of soot and smoldering embers. And every night I return to it.

Putting lipstick on the abyss doesn't make it stop staring back at you, nothing does. That's a reality that's just a part of being alive.

This is a universe that takes vibrant youthful flame and turns it into smoldering embers. The more you struggle, the more you'll feel yourself choking on your own flames. And one day those flames will be extinguished whether by yourself or the uncaring entropic universe.

I&amp;#39;m still in highschool even though I&amp;#39;m 21 because my mind never left 2017. I never left 2017 because that was the last time that a group of people gave enough of a shit to me to pretend to welcome me into their friend group and treat me as if I could be a normal functioning member of society. But in the words of my good ex-friend I poison everything I get to and I&amp;#39;m a shitty person with a shitty personality. No, they obviously didn&amp;#39;t keep me around. I was too much of them to handle because I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of one thing since the 3rd grade. Before I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I knew I wanted to be dead. Before I knew I wanted to be dead, I knew that people didn&amp;#39;t like me around. It&amp;#39;s not that I wasn&amp;#39;t charming or nice or funny or intelligent. No, I was all of those things. But I was also very weird and strange and scary. I scared the love right out of them like now I do with everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets sad, right? But not me, I get too sad. I get sad for years: stalk and scream at people and call them names, break things, say I&amp;#39;m gonna kill myself, and leave the other person wondering when I&amp;#39;ll say that it&amp;#39;s them I want to kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people who have met me have thought that I was the coolest guy in the universe: destined for greatness, full of infinite potential with an unbreakable will. That is until I scared that feeling out of them. They&amp;#39;re left wondering &amp;quot;what the fuck did I just see happen?&amp;quot;. Thankfully, these people who&amp;#39;ve shared such intimacies with me all share a condition which allows them to compartmentalize the fact that they never really knew me. Then where there once was a connection, a cold towering metal wall emerges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up to a house of bones where there is no other soul to cling to, and no one that I can pour myself into. I go through a day in a desolate but comfortable prison filled with anything I could ever possibly want but not a soul in site. Through the glowing of screens I encounter thousands of towering cold walls concealing souls that I could never attain. I try to pour myself into them, but I spill myself down the ditch into the gutter and back to the sewer where I belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I return to my slumber to dream of faint memories of a time once lost. Warm soothing feelings. Having my face touched and my hair stroked and holding an angels head in my arms. Holding that angel tightly trying to stop his tears from flowing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nothing stops them from flowing and he pulls his hand away from mine and I feel his scorn as he shoves me away, tells me that I didn&amp;#39;t hold him tight enough, that I was too late, that I didn&amp;#39;t cry for him enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run out after him with my arms wide open but I&amp;#39;m greeted by a tower of cold, harsh, lifeless metal. The person who I used to entangle my soul with is in the arms of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no use running after them, and there&amp;#39;s no use screaming because no one can hear underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a warmth that glows like the sun merely leads to a heart of soot and smoldering embers. And every night I return to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m always talking about just up and leaving without anyone knowing or explanation literally just dropping of the map. I hate everything about my life, absolutely all of it should have been, should be and should continue to be better. I shouldn’t have to live though any of this, every single god damn breath since my first memory feels like a waste and yet I continue breathing and it pisses me off. 

Then I start thinking about why I feel like this, why was I treated that way and why do I still try and justify all the wrongs everyone did just to keep the peace. I will argue for anyone else that every life is precious and that we are all here to better the life’s of each other. But yet here I am getting nothing from it. 

As a kid I was so selfless, at 6 years old I shouldn’t have felt the need to not eat all my food on my plate so my dad believed I was full and could eat what I hadn’t. What kind of child thinks to themselves “if I tell someone no I feel mean” I would give away my last sweet just to make anyone happy. I would never ask for food or money or toys of anyone. When my elderly neighbour gave me money I’d “drop it” outside there gate so they took it back without realising it was me giving it back. 
Why was I so selfless to think “if everyone around me is happy then how I feel doesn’t matter” at such a young age. 
I got bullied for being dirty and thin and I struggled to read and write so I thought I was stupid. I would go days without saying a word to anyone. I would hurt myself on the school floor on purpose just to feel and the teachers just told me to stop being silly. 

I always took on blame for anyone just so they wouldn’t be sad and would stay up all night with friends to make them feel safe and calm.

I'm not a burden to them.... And they are glad that I exist...

My chest won’t be naturally flat and will have scars, unless I get keyhole or peri, and I’ll have to get surgery for a penis. 

I have to spend years and money simply for things I should have had naturally and those are for things I can affect. Estrogen has permanently mutilated my body. I will always be short and have small hands and feet. My hips will always be wide, as they are all bone and fat distribution from T will not help. My fucking skeleton is female and I can’t do anything about it. 

And then we have my family, teachers, and school. My parents would find having a trans son to be shameful and could possibly send me to conversion therapy. Not that I blame them, I’ll just be wasting their money when they already have a son who doesn’t need any of that. My teachers would be malicious and unaccepting. The boys would never consider me part of the group and the girls would be even worse. 

The bathroom situation is whole nother problem. Even the people who aren’t assholes won’t see me as a man. When people know your trans, you are a women to them. The girls treat you like “one of the gals” and the boys stop treating you like they would with other dudes. It is simply the truth.

One day, my friend told about me to the counselor because I was isolating myself. The counselor seemed clueless, didn’t give a shit, and seemed to only be doing it out of liability. She didn’t actually care, she took pity on a sad, fucked up dude. I’m not talking to her ever again.

I’m not waiting until I’m 18, I’m already fucked. My body is already beyond repair and it will get even worse. All of this because of a fuck up that happened before I was born that I didn’t have a choice in. My cousins, classmates, and almost every other man get to be male, but not me. 

People will say I’ll get thought this and transition, but you know what? Maybe I don’t want to stab myself in the leg every few weeks. Maybe I don’t want scars as reminders. Maybe I don’t want to be reminded I went through the wrong puberty. I want to be normal, and if I’m not, then nothing else is good  enough.

I have always been depressed, I believe that that's what this empty feeling is, since I was so young. I never really valued my life the way others do, and sometimes it baffles me when people around me talk about how excited they are about waking up tomorrow or about aging and what not. I can't relate nor do I understand it. I have server self hatred which has been with me for a while. I remember that I drank a bottle of nail polish remover when I was 12 cause I though it would kill me, it didn't, and that disappointed me. I did that because I got a bad report card and couldn't deal with my dad's disappointment so I thought dying was better. I guess my lack of care for my own life at such a young age should have been enough to convince me to tell someone about it, but I didn't. Now its much worse and there is nothing I can do about it. I have dealt with anxiety and starving myself too through out school. 

I started university last year. I somehow made it here and I'm currently studying medicine. I hate what I'm doing. I can't cope with the stress, so I have started cutting my thighs, and for some sick reason, the scars and the blood are pretty to me.

I'm privileged in that my long term girlfriend has accepted me for who I am and still loves me despite being straight (I guess she's flexible in that regard) and supports me unconditionally. My parents are tolerant and will support me as long as I don't go on HRT before giving them a grandchild. 

But damn if it still doesn't suck. I hate being closeted at work, even though my workplace is probably LGBT-friendly, just out of fear of anything that might happen. Of not passing. And I never will be able to go stealth because my country doesn't allow legal name or gender changes for any reason. 

I hate knowing that to most of the world I will always be some freakshow monster. I'm seeing the news about the trans wonan who raped another woman in a hospital ward in the UK. That's what people will think of when they think of me. Being just another psychotic man in a dress.

My mental health is hanging by a thread and good therapists here are just so in demand that I need to wait more than a month in between sessions.

I’m doing my best to not t*ke my life but I have 4 chronic illnesses and I can’t sleep or eat peacefully anymore.  I’ve done all the medications I’ve been prescribed (it took 3 years for a diagnosis and to be taken seriously) but either none of them help or eventually the help wears off. I got some relief for periods of time in the last year or so but now I find it incredibly difficult to sleep and eat due to the constant pain everywhere, dry heaving and nightmares IF I do sleep.  I mostly take naps during the day but it feels like my body is on fire and i deal with chronic fatigue so not being able to sleep but being exhausted and fatigued constantly is an uphill battle. 

I remember feeling incredibly hopeless in summer 2020 and things have only gotten worse since then. I developed severe OCD (not relating to health surprisingly) that made me extremely su*cidal and sent me to the hospital last year and got diagnosed with diabetes a month ago. Things are piling up and I have to finish my school year (I don’t know how I will with the adhd, depression and constant illness) but I truly don’t see anything getting better for me.

I haven’t slept well in 2 weeks. Every single night is pain, severe nausea, medicine medicine medicine, dry heaving, crying, restless leg syndrome (as if I didn’t need more things to deal with at night time) and it makes me want to rip my body off me and just be a soul or something. Maybe then I could enjoy the simplest things and have a will to live.

I don’t wanna keep living, and the only reason I do is because of my family. My dad passed away 6 years ago and my mom was left to take care of me and my brother by herself, and I know me being sick isn’t helpful. (To be clear I’m not suicidal mainly because I feel like a burden, I’m just so sick of being sick and I can’t get help as much as I try)

My family is trying their best. My mom is so fucking strong and I don’t know how she does it. I don’t want to leave them, but I’m indescribably, fucking tired. This isn’t something that will ever get cured. They’re all chronic illnesses that I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life, and the only thing that’s promised to me is that I’ll have more horrible, horrible days ahead of me. Maybe I’ll find a medication that helps me, but I’d appreciate it if no one told me this. I’m so tired of false hope. I’ve tried more medications, lifestyle changes, prayers, doctors and surgeries than I can count and nothing helps. The only thing I have are my diagnoses. 

I know this would break my family. I just know. I know my mom, and while she’s the strongest person I’ve ever met, I know losing her CHILD would destroy her, so that’s why I stay. 

But I’m breaking apart here and I don’t know how much left of me there’ll be if I don’t get relief soon. I don’t go outside because I’m immunocompromised, and even if I tried to I’m ALWAYS sick, with pain or something else so I wouldn’t be able to enjoy my time regardless.  I can’t eat without immediately regretting it in pain and severe nausea, and I can’t sleep without hitting myself (for relief) crying my heart out, nearly vomiting, and trying as many meds as I can without ODing, only to be met with nightmares if I manage to fall asleep. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I rant often (and I don’t blame myself for it tbh) but I know that can be annoying to others. 

My whole point of this wasn’t to look for hope? I don’t think.

Maybe I wanna talk to someone, or maybe I just want someone to tell me SOMETHING that could actually make me feel better. Not false hope.

The only things I can think of that would make me feel freedom right now, would be that all my illnesses could and would be cured instantly, or that my family doesn’t need and that me dying wouldn’t destroy them. 

Neither of those things are possible.

I was literally skipping weeks then it turned to months and then I just quit at 16. I tried to start going to school again, at 17 but it didn't work out, my classmates where so rude to me always making fun of the things I couldn't do and after that I don't plan on finishing high school.
Everyday my life was miserable, I would wake up every day at a different time because I was not able to keep a good sleeping habit then I would play all day on my laptop. Finally when all the people of the house were out id drink whatever I would find vodka, wine, gin till I get drunk occasionally vomiting on the ground and cleaning it while still being drunk witch it was hard. Then after that I would eat and go back to playing and then sleep at like 4 am or 5 other times even at 8.
Then I tried suicide, I tried with various methods by cutting my throat, didn't work, by stabbing myself in the chest, was too much of a pussy to do it, take lots of Xanax pills, awful drug hate it, then I took lots of sleeping pills and had a panic attack texted my teacher, told her everything that was going on she helped a bit and the next day the school finally tolds my mother to take me to the hospital (because I told her that I wanted to die but she took weeks searching for a therapist and nothing).

My girlfriend, my fiance, dumped me two years ago. She cheated on me, regullary, right in my apartments, when i was at work, trying to earn money for us, thinking about gifts that i will buy for her at the payday. 

I've worked on this problem, like, really worked every day, I almost cured, never gave up, i am always positive you could never say that i am on the edge, keep chatted with everyone, approached other girls IRL with no problem, i was successful with them. Successful only to the point of a first date it never got further. There were a lot of them, no joke, 800+. Once i had a period when i was meeting up to 5 girls for a 3 months everyday, but nobody stayed with me longer. I've tried different methods with every, i was sincere, i was a liar, i was rude, badass, kind or caring, i've tried to build a sirious relationships or just a hookup. I read a lot of literature, about girls, about mindset, i am stoic btw (i was, i guess, after this letter). I've tried forget about girls comletely for a few months, but i am lonely, i have no friends, i tried tp solve this problem, but it was even more difficult than with girls. 

And I finally met someone who was willing to met with me more than once, she was perfect match in our life goals she had the same views as me, she was pretty. We've chatted a lot, I was organized the dates, planned everything, she liked that a lot, that even turned her on. And i also liked that, to finally be a man, to solve problems, to be needed by someone. That lasted for two months. And one day i called her and she stated that ""She will rather read a book than met with me"". 
Okay, another loss, that was painful, but I'm used to be hated by evetyone, i dealt with it. Kept working on myself,  I was at gym daily, i liked it, i studied my profession daily, i liked it. But then, i burned out. I lost the point to do this. I know that life won't get better, it can't get only worse, I can't achieve my goals, they're impossible, especially with this world crisis. 

And also one thing happened. I accidentally stumbled upon my ex's social media, for the first time i've checked her pictures. Big mistake, huge. I promised myself to NEVER do this, but i did, for the first time in two years...

She was much more better, in terms of looks, and mood. She improved a lot, new style, new view to life etc... And everything is my favourite, i've teached her all of this, she liked it. Once i even painted her with cosmetics by myself, it was the most intimate and romatic thing that we've done, she was so happy then, with me. Now she's gorgeous with him, she coloured her hair, she did beautiful, big and sexy tatoo, wears high hills which i like, she is stylish now. She got a pet owl, she really likes them, and i do. I planned to gift her on of them while she was with her current bf in my apartments... Now she has everything that i was planning to give her, and ""thanks to him""... There is a lot more but i will not describe everything, that will take forever. That hit me hard.

This is so unfair, she did nothing to be happy, she was never alone, she was never broken, not a second, she had him already when i was her bf.

I don't honestly know where to start with this. Posting here has been in my mind for a couple months now, and still haven't come up with a snappy title or intro. Anyway, let's start in the most boring way possible (I'm sorry for those who actually will try to read this) with background information. As of writing this I'm 19 and will turn 20 later on this year, male, student, your average Joe; I'm not obese, 6ft, normal looking as far as i know/think.

I honestly don't know how i ended up in this situation. At every single step in my education (European public school) I've shot myself in the knee. I always chose something i never wanted to actually do and i regret it everyday.  
As far as i know I've felt like this to some degree since i was around 13-14 and i don't remember what triggered it or if puberty pulled a sick joke on me. My only friend of four years that i still have knows somewhat the situation of me being depressed and want to commit suicide, but I've always held back on some information and just given him the minimum just because for the years I've known him he's the type of guy that always have put others before himself, he's a person i aspire to be, someone i cannot be no matter how hard i try. He always say every time i mention it that he will support me through this and he says that he will be there if i need him, and that i should try to get professional help. I mean he's not wrong.  
I don't really know why i still haven't even i should. I'm not scared of getting therapy or getting medicated. I guess I'm scared of who will come out post therapy/medication. Will I still be me?

I've already tried to kill myself once before; overdosing pills really sucks, especially if you're a dumb motherfucker that don't get help afterwards and just lie there, alone, in pain, not getting help from anyone, laying there enjoying the silence. Well i survived that attempt and now I'm soon to try again, as I've learned my lesson and will not try to overdose again.  
This time it will be hanging myself. I first said when I was younger that ""Fuck it, let's try for 20 and if life still sucks I will kill myself"" and life hasn't gotten better so here I am. The date where I've planned this to go down is at the start of summer break.  
My parents who i somewhat despise don't know anything have started to remind me that I will need to get a job when summer starts and every time they say it I can't deny that I think that they don't need to worry anymore soon. That it all will be okay, and I got a plan. I won't be useless, mentally challenged or stupid anymore, not for long. My parents aren't really the nicest. They're fakes, they put on a mask when around other people and act like all is well and fine. When there's no one around they verbally and physically abuse you. Nowadays it's more verbal, the physical abuse stopped when I was around 10.

I don't know if this is a confession or will be acting as a substitute for a suicide letter. I'm not that great at writing, especially when my English is not my native language. But I've always wanted to be a writer of some sort, but realizing that i am hot garbage when it comes to typing, grammar, adverb etc I gave up on it. I guess it's because I grew up reading due to me not having a lot of friends and getting bullied constantly through age 6-14. At some point I got serious anger issues and whenever they teased me and it turned physical I could end up banging one of the kids face in the ground repeatedly, and if teachers didn't intervene I probably would've tried to curb stomp him or something. I don't want it to sound like a cringe fanfiction or something so I'll add that I took my fair share of beatings, but I also dealt a fair share of beatings too. The anger issues never really disappeared, but i manage to keep them under control for the most part still to this day. 

I don't know how I feel, I can't explain it. All I know is that I don't want help, I want to die. I deserve to die. It is my time to give penance. I have no other alternative left, I can't go on living, there's no potential future left. I'm a failure in the large biological race. I'm both looking forward and dreading the day, but in the end I have to do it. I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

I can't fuck this up. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. FOR ONCE DON'T FUCK IT UP AS YOU ALWAYS DO.

I feel like I need to do this, if I don't everything will just get worse. I'm slowly loosing my mind and feel more detached to reality and progressively feel like things aren't real. I feel like I'm slowly going insane, and it hurts. I probably could elaborate for eternity if given the time but I think I've gotten my thoughts across.

I've been texting suicide helplines and it takes ages to get through and when I do they regurgitate the same stuff about how brave I am to contact them without offering any actual advice.

The only thing that I find helps is sleeping too much because it makes the thoughts stop, but I can't really do that on the days I'm working. 

I just don't feel like I deserve to live anymore. I don't enjoy anything and I'm always distracted. I know it would break my family and my friends but I just want to press the stop button.

,SuicideWatch,"I, \[16 M\] have been contemplating suicide recently. I'm sorry if this isn't as long as the other posts here, it's just because I don't know what to say anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm honestly so done with life. There's nothing worth living for. The only reason why I'm still alive is that I don't want my family do deal with my death. I know if I die, my mum will kill herself, and I don't want that. My sister will be scarred for life, my brothers will be scarred for life, and my dad will die inside. 

You probably think ""you must be stupid, you have a family who love you, why are you suicidal?"" Truth is I don't care that I have a caring family. My mother has done so much shit that I honestly couldn't give 2 shits about her, my dad has never said the words ""I love you"" to me, neither have my 2 brothers. Yes, they probably do love me, but they for sure aren't fucking showing it. 

Your next thought might be ""just talk to your friends about whatever you're going through"". I've done that. I've talked to one friend, and she's an amazing person and all. Checked up on me every day, you get the point. But, no matter how hard she cares, it's not enough. She's just one person out of many who I consider my friends. I recently told some other people, who I consider close friends, that I've been really struggling over the past couple of months. I mean I was close to killing myself on multiple occasions type of struggling. I told them that I wanted to talk to them in-person - to explain what happened to me that made me so numb (this was done via snap, btw, I know, not ideal, but we were all isolating due to covid at the time). I saw them at university today - none of them said hi. None of them asked how I was. How I was feeling. Whether I wanted to talk. They didn't even say bye when they left. Why live when everyone around you (but one person) doesn't give a flying fuck. Maybe they do care, but they certainly aren't bloody showing it. 

No, I can't get better friends. Yes, I've tried. Partly, I don't want to get better friends, since my current friend group is ideal for me. We vibe, they just don't seem to care about how I'm personally doing. Yes, I know that means they don't care about me, I know. I have issues, ik.

Your next thought is ""get professional help"". That is one line I am not willing to cross, at least at this point in time. You see, I'm a medical student. If word comes out that I'm seeing a shrink, fuck knows what my peers will think of me. Fuck knows what the doctors who I'll be shadowing next year will think of me in the hospital next door. No matter how mainstream mental health is right now, deep inside people will see me as weak. In my field, this is not idea. Yes, I know, confidentiality, yada yada yada, unfortunately, confidentiality isn't really stuck well with where I am.

I’m posting this using my main account. Feel free to browse my nine year post history that started when I first got clean from heroin until now, where I’m perfectly sober but more miserable than I’ve ever been.  
 

I’ve been locked up a ton of times, like 14 arrests. It was dumb stuff like drug possession like ten years ago but still, I can never live down the stigma. Getting a job has been one of the toughest challenges yet. I’ve built up an IT resume with achievements and tons of experience, but it’s very rare I can get the single odd temp job thrown my way.  
 

I was raised in a cult, a strict fundamentalist pastors family. I went to a music school in Hollywood after high school and got disowned by my parents for using cocaine. In college. In music school. In Hollywood. Fucking assholes. My biological dad is dead, mom is an alcoholic and I don’t talk to her.  
 

I’ve had my heart broken more times than I can count. I’ve been in long term relationships and I’ve even had a son I had to give up for adoption. I overcame a 6 year heroin addiction. On the streets I had been slamming heroin and cocaine, overdosing more times than I can remember. I’ve woken up with paramedics on tops of me, in strange alleys, I lived in a burned down warehouse in South Central LA for two months.

My whole life, my biggest problem has been a lack of interest in things. I am however empathetic and emotionally there… I can’t find anything to interest me. I have an “ambivalence towards life” is how one of my shrinks put it. I don’t care about anything but here’s the real fucked up part: I really WANT to care. I read self care books and all the famous books people talk about. I learn as much about science and math and history as I can, all day watching videos and scrolling Reddit…   
 

My heart is broken everyday when I see people smiling and laughing and raising families and I know deep down I can never be a part of their world. Happiness exists… but not for me.

&lt;p&gt;Proposed to my girl and now we&amp;#39;re engaged&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I survived suicide three years ago today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to kill myself four years ago today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got married back in May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my wife is pregnant, we have a daughter on the way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I survived suicide four years ago today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to kill myself five years ago today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife gave birth just yesterday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our daughter is an angel, we named her Faith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank God I survived suicide every day&lt;/p&gt;

I went to my mother asking her to take care of me. She turned on me and made it all about her, her and her friend that killed herself. I didn't even try my Dad, he's more of a suicidal mess than I am, and about half as emotionally intelligent. 

I don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm sad a lot. It's lonely, here. It's so lonely. I want to be angry at my mother, to hold a grudge, but I just can't do it. I love her too much. I'm still surprised she reacted like she did, we're normally so close. I just can't stay angry at her, but she hurt me so much. And now I'm all alone.

I don't understand how I'm both so angry at her and just want her approval so much at the same time. I just want her to be proud of me. The worst part is, she *says* she's proud of me, but I just can't make myself believe it. It's not her fault I can't believe her, that one's mine. She's an honest woman, she says what she thinks, often times to the point where it upsets and confuses other people. 

She praises my guitar-playing skills, but I can't think about anything except how bad I must sound, how I just can't get the bridge to *Friday I'm In Love* right, or how I've been playing with the capo on lopsided for the past ten minutes. She praises my fanfiction, but I just can't think about how it'll never be as good as the source material, how she'll never be as invested in it as she would be if it was the original material. 

Why is it that even when I get what I want, I'm still not happy? I do want her praise, right? That *is* What I want? 

If it's not, then what *do* I want? 

I've been watching this show called *Power Rangers Lost Galaxy* the past few days, and there's one character in it I adore. Her name is Kendrix Morgan, and she's so great. I wish I could just *be* her, instead of this idiot teenager who still desperately wants to go back to being eleven. 

What makes Kendrix so wonderful? 

What's the difference between her and everyone else? 

How is she so naturally good? 

It's not like she's real, anyway. I guess I can put those questions to rest. But I just like Kendrix so much. 

Well, this ramble has gone on too long, so I'll say goodbye. I don't understand everything with my mother, I don't understand my own stupid emotions, I just want to be Kendrix who's smart and kind, and also a a bonus dies at the end to save everyone, *and* comes back!

,SuicideWatch,"Long post, sorry..  
I have a boyfriend who is diagnosed with depression and has suicidal thoughts. They started to self-harm themselves again after weeks of not doing so.A little backstory, we are in a Long Distance Relationship and known each other for half a year, he won't let me visit him until December this year, but I'm worried something happens until then. He has been starting to get distant and isolates himself since a week, states he wants to be alone, I'm not sure if he needs alone time or if it's because of his depression.I'm scared he'll do something or that his wounds open again, two days ago he said he's been tasting blood in his mouth 24/7 because a rather big wound opened which wasn't fully healed yet and he didn't deny that he didn't self-harm.

I have talked to him about therapy once last year, but as far as I know he doesn't go nor does he want to. He is hesitant and doesn't open up when talking about his depression or suicidal thoughts, the only times I witness or hear from it is when it's happening and he has a breakdown. I can't even ask him how he feels daily, he doesn't like answering that question and I found out it's because he doesn't want to lie to me. When I ask him how his day was, he says he doesn't know.

I'm at loss. I've never dealt with someone who is depressed or has suicidal thoughts before, how can I approach him if he doesn't want to talk about his depression or thoughts? He's already tried to attempt suicide a few times before he met me, I'm scared he'll try again. He said he will tell me if he'd die, but I don't want that day to come. We do plan to have a future together eventually, but I'm just so scared. I don't want to lose him. I love him. I'm always checking up on him daily, sending messages, making apparent I'm here, sometimes making little gifts like drawings.

He lives alone (with a few cats), his sister is in a coma right now and he doesn't have any other family members. He lives so far away, I did tell him if he'd let me I'd come visit immediately, but he didn't respond to that. Generally, he always reponds so late these days and sometimes completely ignores - as I've mentioned, being distant and isolating himself (but he did say he want to be alone a bit a week ago but since he's harmed himself again two days ago I'm not sure).

He pretty much hates (humanity) human interaction, only has few people he ""withstands"", likes, I'm one of them. I get that that might be a reason he won't go to therapy, but ultimately I don't know. He doesn't open up to me and I only know what's happening when he has breakdowns.

Please, any help is appreciated, what can I do? I can't get through him. I'm scared. He says he's fine, but his behavior tells me otherwise. I'm scared. I've been trying to research for days on how I could help him, I don't know. He wouldn't possibly consider therapy.",t2_dh0jmbqy,False,,0,False,"My boyfriend is harming and isolating himself.

He has been starting to get distant and isolates himself since a week, states he wants to be alone, I&amp;#39;m not sure if he needs alone time or if it&amp;#39;s because of his depression.I&amp;#39;m scared he&amp;#39;ll do something or that his wounds open again, two days ago he said he&amp;#39;s been tasting blood in his mouth 24/7 because a rather big wound opened which wasn&amp;#39;t fully healed yet and he didn&amp;#39;t deny that he didn&amp;#39;t self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have talked to him about therapy once last year, but as far as I know he doesn&amp;#39;t go nor does he want to. He is hesitant and doesn&amp;#39;t open up when talking about his depression or suicidal thoughts, the only times I witness or hear from it is when it&amp;#39;s happening and he has a breakdown. I can&amp;#39;t even ask him how he feels daily, he doesn&amp;#39;t like answering that question and I found out it&amp;#39;s because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to lie to me. When I ask him how his day was, he says he doesn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at loss. I&amp;#39;ve never dealt with someone who is depressed or has suicidal thoughts before, how can I approach him if he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about his depression or thoughts? He&amp;#39;s already tried to attempt suicide a few times before he met me, I&amp;#39;m scared he&amp;#39;ll try again. He said he will tell me if he&amp;#39;d die, but I don&amp;#39;t want that day to come. We do plan to have a future together eventually, but I&amp;#39;m just so scared. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose him. I love him. I&amp;#39;m always checking up on him daily, sending messages, making apparent I&amp;#39;m here, sometimes making little gifts like drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lives alone (with a few cats), his sister is in a coma right now and he doesn&amp;#39;t have any other family members. He lives so far away, I did tell him if he&amp;#39;d let me I&amp;#39;d come visit immediately, but he didn&amp;#39;t respond to that. Generally, he always reponds so late these days and sometimes completely ignores - as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, being distant and isolating himself (but he did say he want to be alone a bit a week ago but since he&amp;#39;s harmed himself again two days ago I&amp;#39;m not sure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pretty much hates (humanity) human interaction, only has few people he &amp;quot;withstands&amp;quot;, likes, I&amp;#39;m one of them. I get that that might be a reason he won&amp;#39;t go to therapy, but ultimately I don&amp;#39;t know. He doesn&amp;#39;t open up to me and I only know what&amp;#39;s happening when he has breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, any help is appreciated, what can I do? I can&amp;#39;t get through him. I&amp;#39;m scared. He says he&amp;#39;s fine, but his behavior tells me otherwise. I&amp;#39;m scared. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to research for days on how I could help him, I don&amp;#39;t know. He wouldn&amp;#39;t possibly consider therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

It's been nearly a year and her pleads with me mimic my internal voice. I can't do it. No matter what plan or goals or charts or any plan I try.

I am only capable of productivity when I am forced into it (job for money) or threatened by something external (parents growing up, now fiancé). 

the pills don't help. I've tried so many different therapists and doses of four different ADHD pills and three different depression meds and I just sit. I do nothing. The only serve to make me cry less and make it so I can go to work and brush my teeth. Which is something, I suppose. But not enough. Not enough for me to ever be a good partner, father, or really do anything involving another person. I suppose I could take care of a dog. Might be my hard limit there. 

There is no reason for me to be like this. I have no traumas, no dark past, no rough upbringing. I have two parents in a happy marriage who love me more than life in a middle class house in a great school district. I was a bit of a weird kid growing up but i had friends, I was happy. No deaths in the family to speak of. No tragedies or traumas. No reason I shouldn't be a perfectly normal person. But the pills don't help and the therapists have no idea why I'm like this. 

I love my fiancé more than anything. She is my opposite. For starters, she has actual reasons to be sad. Find any psych textbook, rip out all the types of trauma, put them on a dart board, and toss a dart blindfolded at it and you'll be bound to hit something she has experienced. And yet she persists. She keeps going. She drives herself through the tears and the suicidality and the self loathing and stress of all she does and she keeps going and EXCELLS. Top of her class, top employee wherever she graces with her presence. And it all comes from within. I look at her in awe and pride. So smart, so driven, so kind. A bright future. She is truly what I wish I was. And I have to set her free. I can't keep her trapped with me. She won't leave me. She yells and screams and begs and pleads with me because I know deep down she loves me but I really don't think she'll leave me. But she has to. I used to get panic attacks at the thought of her leaving but ever since we moved in together they have subsided significantly. I first thought it was because I was more secure in the relationship now that we've taken it to the next level (moving in, getting engaged) but that's not it at all. I think I welcome her leaving me. I think I know deep down I won't get better and she has to free herself from me, from my failure. 

I don't know if I want to kill myself. I don't think I will do it. Maybe on my own in a little apartment with nobody to disappoint I'll be able to keep going. Maybe tread water. I have a decent job that I like after all, and a few friends. But I worry that I won't be able to stay away from her. Or at least ever move on. And that suggests to me that I have to end my life to free her. Maybe that's dramatic, maybe I'll have the restraint to leave her alone. I probably will. But can I ever get there?

,SuicideWatch,"Dear Sabrina,

  I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry Sabrina, but I don't think I can do this anymore. It hurts so much and I can't think straight anymore. I'm such a fucking coward but I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore. I feel so inhuman and garbage and I just can't take it anymore, I give up.  I don't think I can endure the possible years of therapy and medicine, feeling emotionless and void, it scares me so much and I don't know why. 

  And please don't take this as your fault, you have done nothing wrong against me. You have been nothing but great and awesome to me and you were honestly the girl of my dreams. The girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. The girl I wanted to share memories with. The girl that carries our children. And I'm sorry but I honestly don't think I'm going to be able to grow anymore. I feel so stuck in this never ending cycle and I just don't want to be in this Earth anymore. I'm so tired of hurting myself, and hurting you, and others in my life, I feel so evil. I just can't do it anymore. 

  I love you so much Sabrina. I really do, with all my heart. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong for you and for what I'm about to do now. And I know that no amount of words or actions could ever pardon me from this, but I hate my life so much. You were one of the only good things to come into my life and I ruined it. I ruined our relationship. I ruined the love we have for one another to point where we had to take a break. 

  I feel like every chance I get to turn my life around and be better, I just ruin and destroy it. And I'm sorry for doing this. I'm sorry for causing you to hurt. To feel guilty. I'm sorry for making you feel neglected at times. I'm sorry for not being there all the time. For the nights I've fallen asleep early. For the moments I've gotten snippy with you or lashed out on you. I know I wasn't the best boyfriend on the planet, but when I'm with you, it made me want to be. It made me want to try and be the best boyfriend I could possibly be and I couldn't have even done that.

  There's so much pain that I've brought to you that I could never forgive myself for. You've shown me so many wonders and the truest love I could have ever felt and I repaid that back in tainted love, emoty promises, and disrespect. I honestly don't deserve the love and compassion you've shown me. I treated you so unfairly. And again please don't think that this is your fault, because it's not, and please don't feel guilty. I'm the one who made the wrong decisions and continue to do so. Please don't forget that I loved you, and please don't think too long of me. I always loved you and I always will. You have been the star in my empty night sky and I loved being able to say that I was yours.
 
 I wish you the best of luck in this life. I hope that you're able to succeed in digital art, psychology, engineering, or whatever the future holds for you. You are a talented, honest, awesome person and I know you're going to do great things in life. And I know that you'll find someone who can treat you 1000× better than I ever did, and lead a happy family with them. I'm sorry it couldn't have been me. And I'm sorry for hurting you this one last time. But I know you're strong, and you can overcome anything. 

  Please don't ever forget how beautiful you are. Or how your voice is that of the singing birds. Or how your smile could melt anyone's heart. You are the most perfect woman on this planet, please don't ever forget that.

   This is my final goodbye Sabrina, if I've sent this to you it means that I've killed myself or am currently attempting. And I know this is going to hurt a lot, but I can't do it anymore. Everyday it feels like I'm being stabbed in the heart and in the chest and I just want it to stop. Goodbye my soulmate, my princess, my love, my wife, the love of my short lived life. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

Love,

I’m the scapegoat of my family. I’ll always be a problem that can’t be solved, and even when I do my best for them I’m still somehow the problem.

My health is out of whack all of the sudden for no reason. This could be a blessing in disguise if it kills me young but before then I’m just dealing with painful symptoms.

And worst of all, the one person I actually care about has even worse health problems that aren’t getting better. It may be cancer and if they need to be hospitalized again they outright said they won’t get treatment bc they “can’t afford it”, so it’s possible they’ll just die even if it’s preventable bc of cost. Leaving me all alone. This is by far the worst of everything. I can’t do this without them. They’re the only light in this fucked up world and if I lose them I just can’t anymore.

I love my one, single irl friend, I’m sorry to trigger you like this, but you have to live life on your own with your future husband. Sadly that’s never been an option for me. I can’t do this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I refuse to “seek help” or take medication because of multiple reasons. These people don’t *know* what it’s like and almost every single person I’ve been to in the past is there for a paycheck.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't think anyone will read this, and that's fine. When I was 13 (21 now) was the first time I ever planned it. Of course I didn't go through with it, being rational and thinking if I just make it another 2 years, I'll look back and laugh. Two years went by, and I did not laugh. But I decided to wait another 2 years and look back. Still didn't laugh. At 17 due to stupid circumstances I had to move out and take care of myself. For a while, this made me feel good actually. That is until my job at UPS dried up and I was forced to look elsewhere. The next one was fucking awful, I don't want to get into it but I lasted longer than any other new-hire they had. I got into fights and shouting matches with people I hated fucking seeing every day. This time I came very, very close until I met this girl, now my ex, who made me once again feel optimistic about being alive. Throughout our relationship, I would constantly quit jobs, go unemployed for a few months, living off my savings then jump to another one I hated. After 3 years of living in this townhouse that kept having issues, I decided that I couldn't keep working 12-14 hours and returning to my depressing room that I hate. I truly wanted to make the jump and pursue my purpose. I sat in the basement one night, after my sibling told me she would never contact me again when this is all over, yet again looking back and thinking why didn't I just wrap this all up when I was 13? Sure, I had some interesting and fun times, but nothing meaningful to me. I gained lots of wisdom, but no where to apply it. It really dawned on me just how pointless it all was. The experiences I had did not make up for all of the pain. My grandmother telling me I belong in the dark, my mother gaslighting and using witchcraft against me. I'm only slightly skimming the surface here, I'm not here to tell my life story really. I decided I had nothing to fucking lose, so I decided to live in the car to force myself away from bills, and to force myself to be outside and not in my room. I had also started a clothing brand in which I put my heart and soul into, and always get compliments on my designs when people see me wearing it. I really wanted to just wrap my life up, because the life I want to live keeps fleeing from me. So I told myself one last time, you can end it here in this basement or you can try ONE more time and look back on this day. I lived in the car for 4 months, without plates or registration, knocking out my whole list of shit I had to get together, working in the library on my brand and another business opportunity that came up in the summer. My job called me back, after I quit a month prior, and I was running low on cash, so I took it. 12-14 hours hard labor, then I'd hit the gym before they closed to shower, then find a good parking lot and sleep for a few hours just to repeat. Eventually I got fired for flipping out on a motherfucker that gave me issues for no reason, I think because this girl had a crush on me, and shortly after found myself living in an office my associates and I decided we needed to continue our business, which I'm losing faith more and more but I keep pushing forward. I'm now at the final point, where I look back at my day in that basement and realize I'm no where near where I pleaded with God to put me. My car got stolen and I'm stuck. I get to shower maybe once a week. I feel nothing but isolation. I sold everything over time so I could keep surviving. I had to sell stocks when they were low and now they're worth twice what I sold them for. I don't even cry anymore when I think about ending my life. After many sessions of looking within myself, my brain has completely rationalized this. I cannot and will not go much longer. I have an official date set in which I've thought out carefully. I see angelic signs and repeating numbers that tell me I'm on the right track, but I'm at the point where I think I'm just being spiritually fucked with. If by the date I set, it doesn't start to look up, I rationally figure it never will. If my businesses don't make it and I have to go back to hard labor 12-14 hours a day, there's just no reason for me to keep going. I'm meant for so much more than this. I feel I've wasted my best years, my young years. Most people I come into contact with think highly of me, and assume I'm going places. I do everything I can to uplift those around me and convince them to keep going with optimism. Lately I've been having very dark thoughts about hurting everyone that has hurt me. You'd never look at me and think I would be having these thoughts. My mind goes to dark places every single day, usually about how I'm not good enough and I'm a piece of shit and the world would actually be a better place without me. Boo fucking hoo lol.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm feeling suicidal.  I've felt this way in the past. There are many times I wished I was killed before I ever had children.  When my oldest was 6, I attempted suicide the day after Christmas.  I wasn't trying to ruin the holidays.  I had just been depressed for so long.  I kept everything inside to myself.  I made an appointment to see a therapist the week before,  but my appointment was 3 weeks away.  That night I called the suicide prevention hotline, but I never got through to anyone.   I was in hold for an extremely long time.  I decided to seek help from my family.  I told my boyfriend at the time that I was feeling suicidal,  and to please don't leave me.  He told me to go and kill myself.  Then he took our daughter to his grandmother's house.  I called my mom,  and she told me that she was tired of my drama.  I called my dad, and he told me to stop the noise. I called my sister,  and she didn't pick up.  I was upset for many reasons.  One was that I wanted to leave my ""boyfriend"", but he wouldn't let me. He was extremely emotionally abusive to me. He would lie about any and every little thing.  Then I catch him in a lie sad he screamed at me for bugging him.  He screamed at me for keeping tabs in him like he's a kid. He threatened to abandon me everyday for a period in time.  One day I decided to help him pack, so his clothes wouldn't get wrinkled,  and he beat me up.  I didn't tell my family the ins and outs of our relationship, and they liked him. He would complain to my family that I'm so sensitive and I ask a million questions.  They believed him, and then add their input.  Mom would add that I was a terrorist when I was ready.  My mom thinking I was a terrorist,  was just me trying to explain to her why I was sad. My mom never wanted to hear that I was sad.  She doesn't believe in mental health.   My crying in my bed at night would get my screamed at.   My dad hates emotions,  the end.  My childhood with him was him screaming ""stop the noise"", when I cried.  My parents definitely hugged me and kissed me, just never when I was sad or upset.  They never tried to comfort me. The fact that I am admittedly sensitive,  and get sad easily,  makes that fact worse.  My mom treated me differently from my sister, because by the time I lived with only her, I reminded her of my dad, whom she hated. I think my sister was blind to the fact that we can do the exact same thing,  and I would get treated so harshly.  I was tired of the world,  so I took half a bottle of aspirin.  I was hoping go bleed out. I was in the psychiatric ward for 3 weeks after they gave me activated charcoal. I was humiliated.  My parents never acknowledged that I called them that day.  My dad had the nerve to ask me ""what happened"" when he visited me in the hospital.  I told him that I had a headache and took too much aspirin.  He acted like he believed me, then said I was crazy for not knowing better.  I honestly don't know if he believes it, or if he knows the truth, and just refuses to bring it up. I literally told him what i was going to do 2 hours before. My mother called a few times while I was in the hospital.  My sister never called.  I felt even more alone and ignored than ever.  I tried suicide a few times after that. I took an entire package of caffeine pills. I just ended up in the hospital,  and I tried to pass it off as food poisoning.  The doctors gave me a toxic screen because my heart was racing.  Apparently they don't check for caffeine,  because it came back negative.  I tried to drown myself.  I once stood on the edge of a 6 story building,  wondering if it was high enough,  or if I was just going to hurt myself.  I was drinking vodka, trying to get my nerves up. I didn't jump, because I know someone who tried,  and survived,  they just weren't right after that. I didn't have access to a taller building.   I darted out in traffic.  The last time I thought about suicide,  I thought about a suicide hood.  I wanted a hood, and to make it airtight,  and have helium replace the oxygen.   It was supposed to be peaceful,  but for some reason,  I didn't go through with it.  Obviously,  I never told my family again,  even when they had to pick me up from the hospital. I told my family,  thinking they just didn't know how bad I felt, and they would tell me something to make me seem like I was overreacting,  and that I was cared about. Instead they showed me that me being unhappy,  was a personal affront to them.  That's how I saw it my entire life,  I was simply hoping that they would finally show me that wasn't the case.  They showed me that I was right all along and that they were well aware of what they were doing to me.  I didn't need to fo through that more than once.  If I wanted to die, they had no intention of showing me that they wanted me around.  They would rather me gone if I was going to be sad and cry.  I was fine for a while.  I went through bad times,  but I was living,  and making it through. All my desires to die, was tied to a relationship. All of them.  I was finally in a good place, alone.  Then someone came and my emotions peaked again.  I hare seeing people sad. It reminds me of all the times when I was sad, and no one would even attempt to help me through a dark period.  They just got mad that I was not happy,  and letting them know.  I know What it's like to go through a rough patch, and keep it to yourself.  I know for many, the homicidal and suicidal thoughts are there, unspoken to most, if not everyone.  I try to be there for everyone.  I feel physical pain, if I see someone in emotional pain,  and I don't try to be there. That's what I would have wanted. Everyone in my family always says how kind I am. Thay I always go out of my way for others.  If they see that,,why are they so cruel to me, when I need emotional support?   My dad can't be that to anyone.  My mom however,  is just that for my sister now that she's going through her trials. Why can't they see that I've always given so much,  because it's what I've always needed.  Why do people use me for things,  then cause me to need it myself?   I don't have a me in my life. I'm feeling that old feeling,  but it's different.  I don't think I will make it this time.   I'm trying to be strong.  I'm trying to keep going.  I have children.  For the first time in almost 15 years,  I told someone how I felt.  I tried to call my ex, just to ask him how he would react if I told him I felt like I wanted to die. I have a feeling he will yell at me and tell him to leave him alone. I told one of my younger children because she walked in whilei was crying uncontrollably.  I just told her that I think I'm breaking down, and that I can't take it anymore. She told her sister.  They came up to hug me.  That helped. I don't want to bother my oldest, but I decided to send her a text telling her that I'm breaking down.  I don't know how she will react. Even before this last bout of depression hit, I dreamt I jumped off of a bridge,  and I saw my daughter asking ""she's isn't stronger yet? I'm sure she just went for a swim,  she likes long walks. ""  In the dream I thought to myself,  she knows I can't swim,  plus the water burns.   Somehow I came to the conclusion that I dreamt about Tyre Sampson, because I had that bream about 24 hours before his death.  Now, I'm not so sure. I wasn't depressed then.

I&amp;#39;ve felt this way in the past. There are many times I wished I was killed before I ever had children.  When my oldest was 6, I attempted suicide the day after Christmas.  I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to ruin the holidays.  I had just been depressed for so long.  I kept everything inside to myself.  I made an appointment to see a therapist the week before,  but my appointment was 3 weeks away.  That night I called the suicide prevention hotline, but I never got through to anyone.   I was in hold for an extremely long time.  I decided to seek help from my family.  I told my boyfriend at the time that I was feeling suicidal,  and to please don&amp;#39;t leave me.  He told me to go and kill myself.  Then he took our daughter to his grandmother&amp;#39;s house.  I called my mom,  and she told me that she was tired of my drama.  I called my dad, and he told me to stop the noise. I called my sister,  and she didn&amp;#39;t pick up.  I was upset for many reasons.  One was that I wanted to leave my &amp;quot;boyfriend&amp;quot;, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t let me. He was extremely emotionally abusive to me. He would lie about any and every little thing.  Then I catch him in a lie sad he screamed at me for bugging him.  He screamed at me for keeping tabs in him like he&amp;#39;s a kid. He threatened to abandon me everyday for a period in time.  One day I decided to help him pack, so his clothes wouldn&amp;#39;t get wrinkled,  and he beat me up.  I didn&amp;#39;t tell my family the ins and outs of our relationship, and they liked him. He would complain to my family that I&amp;#39;m so sensitive and I ask a million questions.  They believed him, and then add their input.  Mom would add that I was a terrorist when I was ready.  My mom thinking I was a terrorist,  was just me trying to explain to her why I was sad. My mom never wanted to hear that I was sad.  She doesn&amp;#39;t believe in mental health.   My crying in my bed at night would get my screamed at.   My dad hates emotions,  the end.  My childhood with him was him screaming &amp;quot;stop the noise&amp;quot;, when I cried.  My parents definitely hugged me and kissed me, just never when I was sad or upset.  They never tried to comfort me. The fact that I am admittedly sensitive,  and get sad easily,  makes that fact worse.  My mom treated me differently from my sister, because by the time I lived with only her, I reminded her of my dad, whom she hated. I think my sister was blind to the fact that we can do the exact same thing,  and I would get treated so harshly.  I was tired of the world,  so I took half a bottle of aspirin.  I was hoping go bleed out. I was in the psychiatric ward for 3 weeks after they gave me activated charcoal. I was humiliated.  My parents never acknowledged that I called them that day.  My dad had the nerve to ask me &amp;quot;what happened&amp;quot; when he visited me in the hospital.  I told him that I had a headache and took too much aspirin.  He acted like he believed me, then said I was crazy for not knowing better.  I honestly don&amp;#39;t know if he believes it, or if he knows the truth, and just refuses to bring it up. I literally told him what i was going to do 2 hours before. My mother called a few times while I was in the hospital.  My sister never called.  I felt even more alone and ignored than ever.  I tried suicide a few times after that. I took an entire package of caffeine pills. I just ended up in the hospital,  and I tried to pass it off as food poisoning.  The doctors gave me a toxic screen because my heart was racing.  Apparently they don&amp;#39;t check for caffeine,  because it came back negative.  I tried to drown myself.  I once stood on the edge of a 6 story building,  wondering if it was high enough,  or if I was just going to hurt myself.  I was drinking vodka, trying to get my nerves up. I didn&amp;#39;t jump, because I know someone who tried,  and survived,  they just weren&amp;#39;t right after that. I didn&amp;#39;t have access to a taller building.   I darted out in traffic.  The last time I thought about suicide,  I thought about a suicide hood.  I wanted a hood, and to make it airtight,  and have helium replace the oxygen.   It was supposed to be peaceful,  but for some reason,  I didn&amp;#39;t go through with it.  Obviously,  I never told my family again,  even when they had to pick me up from the hospital. I told my family,  thinking they just didn&amp;#39;t know how bad I felt, and they would tell me something to make me seem like I was overreacting,  and that I was cared about. Instead they showed me that me being unhappy,  was a personal affront to them.  That&amp;#39;s how I saw it my entire life,  I was simply hoping that they would finally show me that wasn&amp;#39;t the case.  They showed me that I was right all along and that they were well aware of what they were doing to me.  I didn&amp;#39;t need to fo through that more than once.  If I wanted to die, they had no intention of showing me that they wanted me around.  They would rather me gone if I was going to be sad and cry.  I was fine for a while.  I went through bad times,  but I was living,  and making it through. All my desires to die, was tied to a relationship. All of them.  I was finally in a good place, alone.  Then someone came and my emotions peaked again.  I hare seeing people sad. It reminds me of all the times when I was sad, and no one would even attempt to help me through a dark period.  They just got mad that I was not happy,  and letting them know.  I know What it&amp;#39;s like to go through a rough patch, and keep it to yourself.  I know for many, the homicidal and suicidal thoughts are there, unspoken to most, if not everyone.  I try to be there for everyone.  I feel physical pain, if I see someone in emotional pain,  and I don&amp;#39;t try to be there. That&amp;#39;s what I would have wanted. Everyone in my family always says how kind I am. Thay I always go out of my way for others.  If they see that,,why are they so cruel to me, when I need emotional support?   My dad can&amp;#39;t be that to anyone.  My mom however,  is just that for my sister now that she&amp;#39;s going through her trials. Why can&amp;#39;t they see that I&amp;#39;ve always given so much,  because it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve always needed.  Why do people use me for things,  then cause me to need it myself?   I don&amp;#39;t have a me in my life. I&amp;#39;m feeling that old feeling,  but it&amp;#39;s different.  I don&amp;#39;t think I will make it this time.   I&amp;#39;m trying to be strong.  I&amp;#39;m trying to keep going.  I have children.  For the first time in almost 15 years,  I told someone how I felt.

,SuicideWatch,"For some background I was in a toxic relationship. I ended up kissing someone else while we weren’t talking and my now ex girlfriend found out. 

After she found out she ended things with me, and basically told me I’m a scumbag, asshole, I ruined every memory, she hates me, she was going to break up with me anyway, I’ll never find better, etc. It really hurts when someone you love says things like that and you have no answer, not even for yourself, so you absorb them and take them to heart because there’s no arguing it, they’re right. It’s been a little over a week now and I’m going back to an emotionless state of depression and one more fuck up away. This is by far the worst it’s ever been, every time I’m alone all I can think of is her and how I fucked us up. I feel like I’ve been in an endless spiral of me fucking up everything ever since I was put in this life.

,SuicideWatch,"
So I’ve been browsing this sub for a while, don’t have much to do today so I figured I might as well vent on here. I guess to introduce myself I’m currently 21 and just recently left the active-duty Army to attend college on an ROTC scholarship about 7 months ago. Prior to that, I was deployed to Afghanistan for about 10 months, it’s almost hard to even recall the person I used to be back then. I was so mentally strong and confident in myself and my purpose, ironically despite working 12 hour days seven days a week under constant threat of getting blown up I can’t remember a time when I was better off mentally like nothing in the world could stop me as I had a plan and was going to stick with it and if I did end up getting murked I was just fine with that too. I stayed pretty safe for the most part although I did have a pretty close call with a rocket that landed in a ditch on the hill below the building I worked in. It obviously scared the ever-living fuck out of me and everyone else but after like 20 minutes we were all laughing about how close that one was and how “if only the stupid guy had aimed higher, he would have got us”. The whole affair really only strengthened my resolve and made the return home that much better, getting back to the states was probably the best moment of my life even if it was right in the middle of COVID lol. 

I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to “flex” my great strength or anything I’m just trying to describe who I was then to who am I now as they aren’t even remotely the same person. Problems started to arise for me around 3 months after getting back after the novelty of being back home wore off. I started to experience this weird sense of dissociation and depressive episodes that would sometimes last for an hour to a day and then I would suddenly snap back to what I considered a “normal” state of mind. These normally entailed feelings of hopelessness and dread like something in my head just wasn’t ticking right and when it came to social situations it was like I was operating on a different frequency than everyone else like I could hear and understand them but there was no emotion behind the words. It was distracting but manageable at that point and I just chalked it up to being burned out at work and figured once I got off active duty and into college things would greatly improve. 

Fast forward to the first semester of college and unfortunately, things have not gone as I imagined. In terms of school and finances, I’m doing fine and everything is going according to plan externally but internally I seem to be slowly degrading bit by bit. The depressive episodes became more intense to the point where I would physically lock up, tighten my muscles, grind my teeth and it feels like my head is throbbing from all the negative thoughts. It is nearly impossible to sleep in this state thanks to the extreme anxiety but then I would wake up the next morning and feel fine, barely being able to remember how I felt the night before. The cycle never stopped though, and then the thoughts of “well if you just ended it this wouldn’t be a problem anymore” started to kick in and that’s when it really started to snowball downhill fast. 

At this point in time, it feels like I’m in this depressive state nearly all the time it’s only a matter of how bad it’s going to be today. The dissociative feelings have been cranked up to 11 and conversations just feel like emotionless formalities. I can no longer connect with friends and family the way I used to, like I said earlier it’s like we’re not on the same frequency if that makes any sense. The thoughts of suicide are ever-present and feel like a big red “emergency eject” button begging to be pressed. The only escape from these feelings are partying, drugs, and alcohol which are great temporarily but eventually everyone goes back to their lives, you sober up and reality slaps you in the face even harder than it did last time. I’ve also developed a very odd fear of human intimacy that I really can’t explain. For instance, I’m a virgin which is a huge insecurity of mine and pretty embarrassing I know, I always figured when I’m in college I’ll meet plenty of women so there’s no need to be insecure about it. However, I’ve had several instances where women have come onto me and I’m totally comfortable with the conversation and flirty talk but once it gets physical, even just them grabbing me it triggers this instant fear and panic response and I make up an excuse and leave in a manic state then beat myself up for the next 2 weeks about how much of a pussy I am. This is honestly one of the major contributors to my broken self-image.  

A couple of weeks ago I randomly started bawling in my car for over an hour and honestly don’t even remember why. I’m not eating much anymore maybe only like one meal a day and my cognitive performance/motivation has declined significantly. My sleep schedule is a total mess I’ll either sleep for 3 hours and wake up from nightmares in cold sweat or sleep for 14 and not want to get out of bed and face reality. What really prompted me to post this though was that last week I got really drunk and ended up putting a gun to my head without even thinking about it and then I realized what I was doing. That’s when I kind of told myself holy shit man this is real and something is very wrong with you. I need some kind of help I know but if I’m diagnosed with any kind of mental health condition, I’ll lose my scholarship and I’ve just worked too damn hard for it. I’ve openly told some of my close friends and family directly that I’m having suicidal thoughts but the response is always “oh c’mon man your way too strong for that” or “you’re just in a slump right now it’ll pass”. As much as I appreciate having people who care for me and appreciate the sentiment it doesn’t do much to alleviate anything. 

I feel like I was never meant to live this long and that that rocket was supposed to kill me that day but I’m living in some kind of an alternate reality where I survived and nothing makes sense anymore. At least then I could have died strong and confident rather than broken. I had a friend who was killed over there and honestly, I wish I could trade places with him, he deserves this life more than I do. 

Sorry, I turned this into an essay but it feels good to get this out of my head for once, if you read this long, I hope you can relate or at least get something out of it, and thank you. 

Finally, I’ll leave you with a song I’ve been listening to on repeat for the past week lmao.

,SuicideWatch,"
I'm not happy. On the surface I don't really look it either. I have no emotional energy to see my dying father and it hurts too much. He has a rare neurological disease that ate away his brain about 10 years ago, and he can now no longer speak   or swallow. After his attempted suicide he has no use of his legs and this has left me with unimaginable emotional pain. I'm constantly picturing what it felt like jumping from the multistorey car park down the road from me.  I warned my mother of his impending suicide when I was about 16 but she was too dumb to listen. He would ring us telling us he was gonna off himself. Show up at my college unannounced.. I told her to get the cats out of the house at least but my dad ended up killing them. For someone who loves cats it haunts me to this day... 

He would lash out at me and my brother when angry. It started with slaps when we were bad. I think I turned into a bad teenager and I started talking back to him. I phoned the police a few times...I would barricade myself in the room to avoid being hit. It was starting to get worse and it wasn't helped by the fact I talked back. The last time nefore we moved to my grandma's He broke my nose. He went after my mum and I said stop qnd he straight up punched me. Blood was everywhere. I am very sensitive and this has traumatised me. But nit as much as his suicide. I literally can't face him now that he can't speak. He can emote just about but he's stuck in his own body. It hurts even more knowing that he loves us. I wish he didn't because I didn't visit for 3 years at one point. I was told that he would stare at a picture of me and my brother all day. 

Janice who is my dad's sister has never failed to voice her disappointment at myself and my brother. I remember qfter my dad's first suicide attempt she was having a go at my mum. I went sick at her. Said some nasty things. She thinks that I should have got over what happened since I am an adult now. She just calls me out on everything. I just want someone's support. I feel torn apart. 

I want to live my life now qfter years of pain. My brother never arranges to see him. My mum has cut him out for good. I cant understand this and I know this is hypocritical. 

I am given a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. I could show symptoms the same time as my father or possibly earlier because the gene is more aggressive when passed from a male. I'm terrified however I have accepted my fate. I will shoot myself before I even get too bad. 

It sickens me to imagine my father laying there in pain with no way of expressing it. He literally sits there for hours stuck in his own body. I want to shoot him to put him out of his misery and then shoot myself. 

I am socially anxious qt work and I can't make friends. I went through a period of depression in school and got brain fog. This brain fog never left me. I cant link the trauma with the brain fog because I'm smart enough to know that not everything works like that. I lost my friends because I was so fucking weird and hostile. Now I don't trust other women and I act fucking weird around them because I don't want them to know the real me. In truth, I just want a friend. But myself is not good enough right now. 

I have my boyfriend but I'm not sure if he's right for me. He's a year older than me and we work together. He has been excellent at offering me support when needed however his actions have showed another story in the past. He gets very argumentative and I am really suspicious that he is a manipulative bad person holding me back in life. But I love him and I wouldn't have made it without his support. I also know that I could be wrong. I am so unsure about everything. He accuses me of getting too close to other men at work. And to be more aware of my surroundings etc. I could just be overthinking it 

I mean it when I say that I definitely have emotionally abusive qualities so I definitely can't tell if I am the problems or he is. 

The prospect of potentially having an alzheimers- like disease in my mid 30s is literally shitting on my progress in life. I was a talented child and now I am working in a crap warehouse slaving myself away. 

I have no sense of humour. Everything said to me I take too seriously. I am insanely sensitive to the point where I have left jobs over a minor disagreement. I do not think that it would take alot to push me over the edge. 

My body is ugly. My face is ugly. I spend 3 hours getting ready for work every day and I slap so much makeup on that I'm unrecognisable. I get attention when I do myself up but I got bullied in school when I wore no makeup. Go figure. 

I want a fulfilling life but I don't see any hope. I just crave love and friendship. I have done some bad things in my life and I am no angel. I feel about 35 when I am 24. 

I dont know where the fuck to go from here. 

I dont want my boyfriend to suffer when I chose to end my life. He wouldn't be able to handle what my mum and dad went through. He's got his own emotional baggage. 

I dont want to insult anyone on here because I know there are people going through FAR worse than me. I just know how sensitive I am and that my father's death is near. I will have to see him, plan a funeral with family members that hate me. I hope someone will have the energy to read this and guide me. There's alot more trauma to the story but my life is a blur, alot like what I have been writing about.

&amp;#x200B;

I have battled every day since I was 11, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, self worth.. I haven't self harmed in a year or so, which is the longest I've gone for any point of my conscious life. The only thing that's ever stopped me was having to use my body for work, but I'd cope in other ways, alcohol, drugs, whatever I could do to get me through. 

I am older now, I consider myself out of the industry, though I am doing outcalls rather than working at a brothel, I'd still be working there if I was allowed to tbh(covid work restrictions), but in a way I'm glad I can't. I am finding it harder and harder to live with the memories of what my life has been, all the cruel things that have been said and done. And having absolutely nobody to confide in, nobody I can trust, it's an incredibly lonely life.

I wish I had been smarter with my money, but when you're living that lifestyle time feels infinite, it feels like it will last forever, and you spend stupid amount of money on nothing because you know you'll make it back in 5 minutes. I so badly wish I'd been smarter, set myself up for my future, but now I have nothing, other than the memories, regrets. I did it all for nothing.

I feel like no matter how hard I work to find happiness, I just can't. I feel like I will never be able to let go of all the things that hurt, even though all I want is to be able to move on. Now I'm pregnant, and I'm so ashamed and am going to have to face doctors appointments, scans, the abortion, alone. Alone. When I imagine any another woman in that situation my heart breaks at the thought of her, my heart breaks for myself. I am so scared, and I am feeling the full gravity of how alone I truly am. 

I just want peace, I don't know how I can continue to exist, it feels impossible. I am overwhelmed, sure, but like all of us there is so much that I am not writing down, it's not as simple as find some support etc, there's so many complex situations I have tried tirelessly to navigate through and let go of, and I can't do it.

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that brings me happiness right now is food. Which is also funny because I have an eating disorder. I am so lonely. When people say this they usually have at least some friends, but I genuinely have no one. I pushed all of my friends away to focus on my ed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom despises me. She says I&amp;#39;m a burden to her. She is sick of me being sad all the time. I have everything, why would I be so unhappy? I&amp;#39;m so ungrateful. She is annoyed by me, by every move I make, just by my existence, I can feel it. She just wants to get rid of me, and I honestly want to get rid of myself too. I wish I wasn&amp;#39;t such a coward and just did it.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like I've been in a depressive episode with periods of short-lived highs and rock bottom lows for years now and it's come to a point where all I see is a black hole and I know there's no looking back now or changing things to lead me to a better outcome for my future. 

I'm not scared of death anymore, I think about it far too often now for me to feel like it's something I need to run away from. I welcome it.

I feel like my problems shouldn't even be posted here because people here are dealing with much greater things but here we go:

i just want to learn how to give affection, I want to learn how to comfort somebody who's upset, I want to learn how to properly love someone, I want to have people who like me around me. i never learned how to comfort anyone, I never learned how to properly show love and affection because it was never done to me. all I've learned is how to take in anger from my mom and then bounce it back like a lazer bouncing off a mirror in a video game and knocking everything down. everyone I love and care about eventually leaves because I don't know how to deal with my anger issues and emotions in general. i want a better mom and I want to restart life. everyone hates me because of something I can' hardly control because I never had to. I've tried to change as a person but nobody sees it, everyone just sees what I was like before. nobody understands people can change so what's the point in changing if everyone will see you as what you were before? i want to leave the internet for good and never come back. ""oh you were so happy before, I wish you were still like that"" I was never happy, all I did was pretend like I was to make everything seem ok and so people don't question what's actually going on. i don't like relationships because I eventually end up ruining them, but here I am with a girlfriend and I'm slowly ruining that relationship too. i want to change for her but people don't even allow you to. I love you megan but god do I hate life and feel like ending it all. 

they expect you to change over night and when you don't they act all surprised and it's so annoying. i want to isolate myself in a locked room with paper and pencils and my Spotify playlist playing on shuffle constantly. i don't want to be seen by the outside world because everyone will eventually start hating me one way or another.
throughout my entire cps case I've been asked ""do you want a therapist?"", ""are you sure you don't want a therapist?"", ""a therapist can really help with things like these."", multiple multiple times and I've turned down all of them because I felt that even if I did change people still wouldn't see me as the new person I've become. honestly, I really wish I accepted the therapy. I'm mentally ill and I can clearly tell and at this point I just want help. 
I've tried to change but in the end everyone just assumes I'm angry all the time. when I tell them I'm not they just go: ""mhm""; like I'm lying even though I'm not and it's really annoying.
The world needs to understand that people can change and that it's not impossible to do so as long as they understand the error of their ways and are actively trying to change. I have noticed I am wrong hundreds of times after I get angry, whenever I apologize and explain why I acted that way I just get told that I'm not sorry. i get told that actually I actually don't care and that I'm just saying what they want to hear. and I get told to just leave them alone and to never talk to them again. and I just want it to end.

the friend who took care of me after i was discharged from the hospital last year is just taking advantage of me emotionally &amp; makes me feel bad when i being up concerns to her and turns it on me that im at fault.

im convinced again none of my friends care. im only here to crack jokes and be the support beam. and even when they are supportive it feels like it’s because they have to be.

im in a wonderful therapy outpatient program and it’s harder to keep up with everything and staying mindful &amp; on the right route to a “life worth living”

It seems like everytime I come close to accepting that there's something wrong with me, I feel the need to remind myself that I could just be faking it all.

Some people my age or younger have made actual suicide attempts, or have been through some traumatic stuff, to which I tell myself that maybe there isn't anything wrong with me. Because of that, I feel the need to prove to myself that I'm suicidal or depressed.

I can't even get a moment to breathe because whenever I find some joy in something my brain says;

""See? You're enjoying something. You're just overdramatic. Stop faking things!"" 

It's a never ending cycle of my brain telling me;

Weekends: ""You're surrounded by a family you hate for 2 days. You're miserable now, but during the weekdays when you're doing online school in the back alone, you'll be better.""

""And besides, the violence from some of them didn't last your whole life. They all get along fine, you're the problem.""

Weekdays: ""Lmao you wanna kill yourself? I thought you liked being alone lol, now you're starved of touch? Just ignore your classes, but if you do, you'll fail, and be even more of a loser.""

Video games/hobbies: ""You're enjoying something? You must not be depressed, but don't worry, you'll no longer enjoy  you're favorite stuff anymore. I'm taking away your motivation.""

Body: ""Lmao you're literally a skeleton with scarred skin, and you lack basic emotion, you can't get a girlfriend. Get used to hugging your blanket and listening to audios, loser.""

And I know for a fact that if I ever have the balls to actually make an attempt, my brain will be like;

,SuicideWatch,"Life is exhausting. The little joys of life aren’t enough to satisfy me. I’m not interested in anything anymore. I’m tired of everyone talking about school and graduation and class credits and jobs. I don’t want to do any of it. I don’t care about any of it anymore. People keep asking me what I want to major in and it’s fucking annoying. A student is all I’m fucking reduced to. I can’t find it in myself to put school before anything else like everyone else is doing. We are expected to sacrifice our free time for the next month for a fucking exam. A piece of fucking paper. I’m so tired. I’m so exhausted and I don’t even know why. I come from school and even on days we do nothing all I want to do is sleep. And nobody understands—I know in the eyes of my teachers, I’m just a student who always comes in late and turns in shit days after and has the worst grades and the worst attendance. They don’t know the me from years ago, the one who got straight As and loved school. I just look like a lost cause now—the people I used to believe I would never be like. They don’t know this current me is a cry for help. 

I want to explain to someone what’s actually happening to me, the things I’ve been going through all alone for the past 5 years of my life, but there’s just too much to say and I’m too tired to write it out. My social anxiety, my passions, my experiences, my abusive dad— nobody has the time to hear it all, no one cares. Just study, get good grades, choose your major, get a job…

I want someone to understand I’m suffering so badly. I want a hug or even a squeeze of my hand. I wish it was that easy to transfer everything I’m feeling to someone. I want someone to know that I didn’t want this kind of life. I’m only sixteen. I had hopes and dreams. I wanted to be a classical pianist even if no one fucking cares about careers like that and all they preach is to get a science or math job that pays well like my stupid fucking dad. But at the same time breaking the mask I’ve kept on all these years will be so fucking embarrassing. I can’t reach out it’s impossible I just can’t. 

This is no longer suicidal thoughts. I have been planning my suicide for years for a date in 2023. But now it feels like I can’t live past august. I don’t just want to kill myself, I am going to kill myself. I don’t enjoy the offers of life anymore. Those short happy moments that make you glad you’re alive: the warm sunshine, puppies, the smell of petrichor, and the sequel of my favorite game, my favorite shows… they’re not enough anymore.

The little joys of life aren’t enough to satisfy me. I’m not interested in anything anymore. I’m tired of everyone talking about school and graduation and class credits and jobs. I don’t want to do any of it. I don’t care about any of it anymore. People keep asking me what I want to major in and it’s fucking annoying. A student is all I’m fucking reduced to. I can’t find it in myself to put school before anything else like everyone else is doing. We are expected to sacrifice our free time for the next month for a fucking exam. A piece of fucking paper. I’m so tired. I’m so exhausted and I don’t even know why. I come from school and even on days we do nothing all I want to do is sleep. And nobody understands—I know in the eyes of my teachers, I’m just a student who always comes in late and turns in shit days after and has the worst grades and the worst attendance. They don’t know the me from years ago, the one who got straight As and loved school. I just look like a lost cause now—the people I used to believe I would never be like. They don’t know this current me is a cry for help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to explain to someone what’s actually happening to me, the things I’ve been going through all alone for the past 5 years of my life, but there’s just too much to say and I’m too tired to write it out. My social anxiety, my passions, my experiences, my abusive dad— nobody has the time to hear it all, no one cares. Just study, get good grades, choose your major, get a job…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want someone to understand I’m suffering so badly. I want a hug or even a squeeze of my hand. I wish it was that easy to transfer everything I’m feeling to someone. I want someone to know that I didn’t want this kind of life. I’m only sixteen. I had hopes and dreams. I wanted to be a classical pianist even if no one fucking cares about careers like that and all they preach is to get a science or math job that pays well like my stupid fucking dad. But at the same time breaking the mask I’ve kept on all these years will be so fucking embarrassing. I can’t reach out it’s impossible I just can’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no longer suicidal thoughts. I have been planning my suicide for years for a date in 2023. But now it feels like I can’t live past august. I don’t just want to kill myself, I am going to kill myself. I don’t enjoy the offers of life anymore. Those short happy moments that make you glad you’re alive: the warm sunshine, puppies, the smell of petrichor, and the sequel of my favorite game, my favorite shows… they’re not enough anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

Did I really think I would be seen as a romantic interest by anyone? Why did I ever think that? I am completly useless. My personality is filled with flaws. My mental health has been in treatment for more than 4 years, yet it has only gotten worse.

The thing is, the root of my constantly declining mental health is my lonliness, wether it be romanticaly or in a friendship aspect. Within my group of friends (if they can even be called a ""group"" or ""friends"") I am but cannon fodder, the guy that stops to tie its shoe laces and when he looks back up he was left behind, the guy whose ""jokes"" are nothing more of a desperate attempt to make people laugh, yet he is met with cold gazes that scream ""disgusting"". He is nothing more than background, a worthless input that brings nothing to a friend group, and that guy is me.

Switching to romantic relationships, I am not boyfriend material. I may look better than average, be of average height and be fitter than most, yet no matter how hard I try, I cannot find a girlfriend. I've been rejected 8 times in 5 years.

,SuicideWatch,"This is gonna be long but i have to give background information first:

I have had a lot of bad shit happen in my life, starting from when I was in grade school. My father was an abusive alcoholic and my mother was never emotionally there for me, and when my parents divorced I felt truly hopeless but for some reason I alway had a glimmer of hope for the future so even though I should have felt suicidal, I didn’t. I just felt immense pain and despair. I’ve always had trouble making Friends and always have felt lonely and like no one really understands me. 

I am a senior in College now and I am about to graduate with a degree in biology and want absolutely nothing to do with it. I’ve always wanted to write and reading has been my only true outlet and way to escape. I chose to study science to appease my family and for the prestige of working in medicine but this past year I was rejected from every PA school I applied to and I realized that I didn’t even want to do it in the first place and I have been burning myself out for four years for nothing.

I’ve had a series of bad roommates in college and haven’t been able to keep friends either because we’ve grown apart or they have dropped out or we have had some sort of falling out. The friend group that I am in now is very toxic, and this past year i’ve realized that i don’t want to be friends with any of them after college.

One of my roommates/friends (this really rich entitled bitch Who always gets what she wants and thinks she’s better than everyone else) and I got into a car accident last October because my tire blew out on the highway and I was almost T-boned by a semi truck. We ended up only with concussions, but through the stress of the accident, not getting into PA school, getting sick during the semester, and struggling with my mental health in general, I had a really bad year and I ended up failing several classes- something I’ve never done before.

I was planning on starting my last semester off strong and focusing on the positive things but right before I was about to start I found out that my father committed suicide on Christmas. Long story short being an only child and my parents divorced I was the sole person in charge of planning the funeral and what to do with his body and selling his things. i’ve been estranged from him for over 10 years but I have had a deal with him basically stalking me to the point where I had to change my name to get peace from him, so needless to say I have a lot of complex emotions and feelings about the situation. my family on his side is also really abusive and has been harassing me and verbally abusing me about the decisions I’ve made regarding his death. 

on top of all this I am in a heavy course of the semester to make up for failing several classes and I am going through the typical stress of finding a job post graduation and figuring out what I want to do with my life. 

my two roommates have had both their boyfriends live with us in our apartment this semester and it has been adding to my stress because I don’t feel comfortable in my own home. After them having lived in my apartment for over a month I asked them if they could only have their boyfriends stay for no more than a weekend. they didn’t take this well and the girl who I got into the car accident with said that I am now the reason why she can’t have a birthday because her boyfriend can’t be there- he had planned on staying for the semester and lives out of state and she claims that it is not worth the money to have him fly in for just the weekend. but despite all the drama they left and everything seemed like it was fine. 

Then her birthday comes around and out of the blue I get a text from her dad saying that he is going to sue me for damages from the accident and if I give his daughter any trouble giving them information they will also sue me for harassment.  

(They are very rich and this girl has made it clear that she could live off of her trust fund for the rest of her life and never work and that they have a mansion and her parents have an aston marten) all This to say,  they don’t even need the money that comes from insurance for medical expenses and it is really suspicious that 6 months later her father is now trying to pursue legal action against me (when the accident was deemed an accident, not my fault)z

the only reason why her father threatened me is because she was upset her boyfriend couldn’t be there for her birthday, so she had him threaten me in an attempt to bully me and give me hell for saying that her boyfriend couldn’t live with us.

I didn’t feel comfortable in my apartment anymore and was worried that anything I said could be twisted and posed as harassment- so I felt like I was forced to leave my apartment. As this happened and everyone in my friend group was around and knew what was going on, none of them would even look me in the eye or say a word to me. They pretended like I didn’t exist. None of them have reached out to me- except for one of my “friends” Who told me that I am over reacting and that my roommate is not the one to blame in this situation. I have been living in a hotel for the past week or so. my entire friend group took her side saying that it was not her fault and her father ruined her birthday by putting the stress on her. Also, The day I received that text from her father I also received a text from my aunt telling me that my father was buried that day and that she hopes that I will regret the decisions I made about his burial for the rest of my life. 

In the matter of a couple of days I lost my entire group of friends and had to move out of my apartment. I have two friends that I am sort of close with who were not involved and one of the girls in this toxic group has been reaching out to them consistently and demanding to know information about what I’ve been saying about all of them. One of the two friends I have left, despite knowing that I cut them out of my life and don’t want to communicate or have anyone know anything about me and what I’m doing anymore, told this girl what she wanted to hear.

I know it’s a complicated story but the point is that I’ve never felt more alone in my entire life and don’t feel like I can talk to anyone because The only like three people I have left in my life are either relaying information back to that friend group or is going through something and can’t handle hearing anyone else’s shit. 

I have no friends I’m living in a strange house with people I barely know I am getting rejected from jobs left and right and honestly I’m at the end of my rope. I feel like crying all the time and I’m so tired of living in a pity party but can’t seem to find a way out. i’m not excited about the future anymore or about graduating and I’m really coming close to feeling suicidal. i’m having trouble holding on to help in knowing why life is worth living because all I have dealt with in my life is just a long series of traumatic events and I feel like if this is the way my life is always going to be I’d rather be dead.",t2_hg7r260b,False,,0,False,idk if anyone cares but i’m struggling to find a reason to live,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_trsubx,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648596599.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is gonna be long but i have to give background information first:&lt;/p&gt;

Friend 2, is a bit more challenging. she more commonly ""cuts"" herself every now and again. and I looked up how to help a friend and asked her 4 questions, thankfully only 2 were answered before I had to stop since it was a no ([link](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/how-to-help-a-suicidal-friend#helpful-resources)).

,SuicideWatch,"On the hopefully hot night of June 25, I plan on ATTEMPTING to kill myself. If I end up a vegetable than at least something has changed. If I get caught being foolish, we’ll at least I planned to carry out my plan.

On this day I plan on ordering something from my favorite local Chinese restaurant and eating there. Afterwards, I plan on buying a few small bags of some good bud and I’ll walk around my neighborhood and smoke a blunt. I’ll make my way to the liquor store and buy a fifth of my favorite liquor, drink it gradually, and eventually make my way to my favorite park and smoke and drink some more! There’s cameras so I’ll have them be really careful!

There’s this one tree at the park that’s obviously bigger, older, more gothic and the center of attention than all the other trees around it; I might pull the trigger underneath it and sacrifice myself to nature and the Gods hoping to be brought back to life again sometime soon/resurrected in any way.

There’s this patch of land where murders of crows hang out daily and nightly, though they’re usually all over the park. I might pull the trigger over there. I wouldn’t mind laying there lifeless so that the murder of crows can stand/fly over my body and decide my fate (hopefully they’ll have mercy on my soul.)

Lastly, there’s this secret looking garden type of area where there’s a lot of beautiful trees and is well hidden and gated. I always went there, sat around and smoked bud there in the past when home wasn’t an option. I might do it there. I gotta do it at night so that I won’t be seen. It may have to happen around midnight or later. I’m sure that they’ll find me the next day because there’s a school, museum, basketball court, tourists, etc. it’s always busy during the day.

I’m not really scared to do it; I’m cold. I’m sure I’ll be shaken or hesitant when the time comes; that’s why I’ll be drinking and smoking. That’s why I’m posting and planning this in advance.

Thinking about it, my mother might get suspicious because I’m out after midnight which is unlike me. I just want to be free enough to do it, and not have her or the cops come snooping and find a gun in my bag. If my plan is foiled, I’ll be homeless, penniless, and very much in trouble. I’ll be drinking in public so I have to steer clear of everything and work like a ninja on stealth mode. If I can get my food, get my weed, get my alcohol, and get my gun… than I’m going to do it… if and when the park is clear.

I’m going to walk around the park with my blunt lit and open bottle to sip on, and once I figure out where my resting place will be, I’ll go into my bag, take out my gun, take a few practice shots then spark some knowledge or clear my mind and thoughts. I’m really looking forward, though I hope the days and time moves slowly. I’ve waited for and planned this moment my whole life.

My childhood was the worst. One Christmas I got no toys but my step brother got like literally 50 gifts. I just want to have fun! I just want to play! I never ever got to have any fun! Now all I try to do is get wasted and walk through the park all by myself as a means of having fun or escaping.

It’s way over my head. I’ve been a millionaire. I’ve been with hundreds of women. I’ve lived on campus at a large university and studied to be a teacher. But today I’m washed up and poor. People think that 27 is when you’re supposed to commit, but that’s a curse. The proper age to die is 36. 360 represents the full circle of life; the ending of a chapter. I’m 36 and I hope this gun has enough power. I hope that I can aim correctly!

I’m not apologetic to anybody. I have no last wishes. No suicide notes. I don’t want to see anybody. I won’t miss anybody. I hope they cremate me. Life was fun while it lasted, it was the people who tried to ruin the fun that made it less fun. Now life is over and I just have to deal with that. I have to come to terms.

,SuicideWatch,"I tried to tell three people how I felt today but I’m so stupid I froze up because my brain tells me it’s inherently manipulative if I tell the people I love I want to kill myself because of course they’d panic but I just feel like this is it. If I keep going at this rate I’m going to put my mom into debt trying to get through school, I inconvenience my friend and my girlfriend, I never do anything right or contribute anything to the world.
Im such a coward I don’t know if I’d ever be able to go through with my plans because of fear but like I told myself earlier, the smart ones are the ones that don’t have to try twice

And my girlfriend makes it sound so easy when I offhandedly mentioned feeling suicidal the other day, as a joke because for some reason I can’t force myself to just tell her, and she makes it sound like it would be nothing to tell my primary care doctor who just put me on antidepressants and sent me to a therapist I can’t afford. 

I know she told her doctor about her depression and she’s getting help and everything and it’s good for her and I love her and want her to get better in her own rights but my family isn’t like hers. They won’t help me, my mom says it’s a serious issue yet basically laughed and then told me off when I mentioned the antidepressants my doctor put me on (super anti medication), my grandma thinks I can do everything by myself and just need to push myself, and I can’t. I just can’t anymore. 

Everyone tells me I have nothing to be depressed about and I know I probably don’t and it isn’t valid but I’m just so tired
My functionality is so limited because executive dysfunction, I can’t do anything, I sit frozen in my room with the thoughts moving so fast I feel like there’s something so so wrong with me…I don’t know how to finish my semester in school. I don’t even know how to wake up in the morning, or speak to someone about it, or ask anybody for help…fuck, I can’t even ask my own girlfriend if I can come over and hang out away from my house because my dad fucked me up so much into thinking that I’m not worth people’s time or energy and that they’re lying when they say ‘but I want you to ask to come over’ and I hate that I can see that but I can’t fucking do anything about it, I feel so trapped and scared and sad when I think about it

I’ve never been able to reach out to anybody online or in class because I can’t socialize like I want to, I never make any friends, I don’t respond to emails or messages that are important cause living overwhelms me, I misread cues and words and inconvenience and upset everyone who loves me more than I would if I wasn’t here. I wish they didn’t know who I was, didn’t have to deal with me, it would make everything easier

I am a blip, a blip that does nothing important and has no skills to get them further in life than they are, and the mask that I’m ‘holding it together’ can’t stay up for much longer, but I’m so terrified of it breaking and I don’t think I’m going to make it through the year like I wanted to. I said I’d put it off today and see how I felt tomorrow but I’m not optimistic

I’m sorry for the long wall of text, and for making you read it, I just figured maybe internet strangers that I don’t know would be easier to talk to than those I love because I can’t hurt you guys like I’d hurt them if I tried to tell them how I felt, and I probably just needed to rant after not being able to say anything about this to anyone but me for almost a year. And I really hope I didn’t break any rules, always makes me so so anxious but i read the rules and thought this would be okay.",t2_2yhycmnz,False,,0,False,I don’t think I’m going to make it through this year,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_trhfre,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648584447.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to tell three people how I felt today but I’m so stupid I froze up because my brain tells me it’s inherently manipulative if I tell the people I love I want to kill myself because of course they’d panic but I just feel like this is it. If I keep going at this rate I’m going to put my mom into debt trying to get through school, I inconvenience my friend and my girlfriend, I never do anything right or contribute anything to the world.
Im such a coward I don’t know if I’d ever be able to go through with my plans because of fear but like I told myself earlier, the smart ones are the ones that don’t have to try twice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my girlfriend makes it sound so easy when I offhandedly mentioned feeling suicidal the other day, as a joke because for some reason I can’t force myself to just tell her, and she makes it sound like it would be nothing to tell my primary care doctor who just put me on antidepressants and sent me to a therapist I can’t afford. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know she told her doctor about her depression and she’s getting help and everything and it’s good for her and I love her and want her to get better in her own rights but my family isn’t like hers. They won’t help me, my mom says it’s a serious issue yet basically laughed and then told me off when I mentioned the antidepressants my doctor put me on (super anti medication), my grandma thinks I can do everything by myself and just need to push myself, and I can’t. I just can’t anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone tells me I have nothing to be depressed about and I know I probably don’t and it isn’t valid but I’m just so tired
My functionality is so limited because executive dysfunction, I can’t do anything, I sit frozen in my room with the thoughts moving so fast I feel like there’s something so so wrong with me…I don’t know how to finish my semester in school. I don’t even know how to wake up in the morning, or speak to someone about it, or ask anybody for help…fuck, I can’t even ask my own girlfriend if I can come over and hang out away from my house because my dad fucked me up so much into thinking that I’m not worth people’s time or energy and that they’re lying when they say ‘but I want you to ask to come over’ and I hate that I can see that but I can’t fucking do anything about it, I feel so trapped and scared and sad when I think about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been able to reach out to anybody online or in class because I can’t socialize like I want to, I never make any friends, I don’t respond to emails or messages that are important cause living overwhelms me, I misread cues and words and inconvenience and upset everyone who loves me more than I would if I wasn’t here. I wish they didn’t know who I was, didn’t have to deal with me, it would make everything easier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a blip, a blip that does nothing important and has no skills to get them further in life than they are, and the mask that I’m ‘holding it together’ can’t stay up for much longer, but I’m so terrified of it breaking and I don’t think I’m going to make it through the year like I wanted to. I said I’d put it off today and see how I felt tomorrow but I’m not optimistic&lt;/p&gt;

Having this mental illness has ruined my life, my reality has been hell ever since I was young. This world is made up of infinite suffering, and it seems like all other people are happy in life except for me. Instead, I lay in my bed crying dried-up tears thinking about what is wrong with me. Ever since I was a kid I was socially rejected. I cried to the teacher to ask the kids to play with me, but they never did. They listened to the teacher for a second, but then yet again they told me that ‘’I am not fit to play the game, get away!’’ Another instance I remember very vividly is when the whole class dressed up for a Halloween party. Everyone had their dress and was ready to go. Despite wanting to go so badly, everyone was picked, except for me. I don’t know why, I was young so I don’t remember why I wasn’t picked. But essentially, the last memory I have is the whole class leaving to go to the Halloween party meanwhile I was crying desperately for me to be included, but they never did… And this has continued to happen, even more so when I grew up. I started to get bullied, I had a group of guys mobbing me. Every time I went on lunch break they would show up and slap me behind the neck. Some of them even hit me in the gut or punched me in the shoulder. I remember a guy much taller than me who was very big, he would just slap me for no reason in front of a crowd of people. Then of course, eventually they ganged up on me and beat me up in the middle of the street, and I lost, like the loser I am. I was also bullied for being the ‘’nerdy kid’’, I was called a ‘’retard’’ my whole life. Every time I entered the class, even in front of the teacher, some kid would point at me and say ‘’Look! The retard came to class today!’’ and everyone would laugh. Then eventually I started skipping classes and getting addicted to the internet and junk food as a way to cope with all of the bullyings. There was also was a girl who used to want to fight me, and would call me slurs and insults in the middle of the street.

When it was my birthday I wanted to invite only 3-4 people to my birthday party, but the teacher (because she knew my parents were rich) decided to call my mother in class (to embarrass me) and made me invite the whole class and pay for it.

,SuicideWatch,"My name is Fabian:

During the last days I have been struggling with my condition and I see everything more difficult, since I crossed the border between my thoughts, the idea of ​​dying is very common in my head; I have depression and surely other disorders to which I have never given a name and I am not interested in doing so. It's hard for me to study, eat, get up or go to bed, think and even cry; Yes, I thought at some point in my life that I could bear all this and it hurts me even more not to have been strong enough to bear it, I want to have more resilience but I make it difficult for myself. There comes a time when you have to say I can't anymore, when it's good to accept that you're tired and that life itself hurts, but that terrifies me, I have very ambitious dreams and I'm afraid I won't be able to achieve them by showing myself the minor setback in my way, still, I keep falling into this very stressful situation. As a child I never saw what a healthy relationship, friendship, parenthood or family is, I do not know how to differentiate betwen good or bad relationships and I am afraid of falling into a relationship like the ones I lived in, I am afraid to look for love where there is none and I think I have done it; I do not deserve love or hate because of my sexual orientation, I deserve respect, and from those who say they love me, I deserve acceptance; it took me too long to come to that conclusion. I can't cry because even when the tears come I withdraw and try to direct my attention to something else, I wish I had the opportunity to scream my pain, to throw a tantrum; all alone with no one to tell me what's wrong or to stop doing it. I have a disease and many people do not understand it, the risk of this is death itself, there are times when life is not attractive enough for me to give it a chance; I'm medicated, but I still want to please the doctors, I want to get out as quickly as possible and I can't. I have seen fear in the eye, I have lived that feeling of death so deeply, it steals my calm and takes away my peace; in my dreams I die, in my thoughts too and apparently in real life too. My vocation is to be a doctor, I want to be an instrument of peace for society, I want to be health that reaches the people, I want to be a support to needy and comfort to the sick, I want to be hope to the disabled, I want to be prosperity and innovation to science, but also I want to be what I love most in the world, I know that I am capable of achieving many things, I am intelligent and proactive, it is that I am currently ill and it seems to be a seriously illness; society, institutions and sometimes the family are not fair, if they do not see tears, sores, scars or burns they do not believe in my pain, I would like it to be so so that they do not ask, so that they feel sorry, so that they even feel pity, but no, I am disappointment, I am shame and I am frustration for all of them. I accept that within the distortion that is society, I fit in less than others, it is difficult for me to have a relationship with other people and I only wish I could be free to think, do and achieve what I set out to do. I know that there are those who have a worse time than me, but maybe that concept will change the day I really get tired and that tiredness turns into death, then I will be a martyr, I will have suffered and for those who ""love"" me I will be an angel who takes care of them from Heaven, they don't understand that the last thing I want is to keep feeling, keep seeing, keep listening and keep suffering.

As a child I never saw what a healthy relationship, friendship, parenthood or family is, I do not know how to differentiate betwen good or bad relationships and I am afraid of falling into a relationship like the ones I lived in, I am afraid to look for love where there is none and I think I have done it; I do not deserve love or hate because of my sexual orientation, I deserve respect, and from those who say they love me, I deserve acceptance; it took me too long to come to that conclusion. I can&amp;#39;t cry because even when the tears come I withdraw and try to direct my attention to something else, I wish I had the opportunity to scream my pain, to throw a tantrum; all alone with no one to tell me what&amp;#39;s wrong or to stop doing it. I have a disease and many people do not understand it, the risk of this is death itself, there are times when life is not attractive enough for me to give it a chance; I&amp;#39;m medicated, but I still want to please the doctors, I want to get out as quickly as possible and I can&amp;#39;t. I have seen fear in the eye, I have lived that feeling of death so deeply, it steals my calm and takes away my peace; in my dreams I die, in my thoughts too and apparently in real life too. My vocation is to be a doctor, I want to be an instrument of peace for society, I want to be health that reaches the people, I want to be a support to needy and comfort to the sick, I want to be hope to the disabled, I want to be prosperity and innovation to science, but also I want to be what I love most in the world, I know that I am capable of achieving many things, I am intelligent and proactive, it is that I am currently ill and it seems to be a seriously illness; society, institutions and sometimes the family are not fair, if they do not see tears, sores, scars or burns they do not believe in my pain, I would like it to be so so that they do not ask, so that they feel sorry, so that they even feel pity, but no, I am disappointment, I am shame and I am frustration for all of them. I accept that within the distortion that is society, I fit in less than others, it is difficult for me to have a relationship with other people and I only wish I could be free to think, do and achieve what I set out to do. I know that there are those who have a worse time than me, but maybe that concept will change the day I really get tired and that tiredness turns into death, then I will be a martyr, I will have suffered and for those who &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; me I will be an angel who takes care of them from Heaven, they don&amp;#39;t understand that the last thing I want is to keep feeling, keep seeing, keep listening and keep suffering. My ambitions are immense, but the most voluminous and impossible for me at this moment is to love myself; I just want to go, no more of this, no more life.&lt;/p&gt;

That doesn’t even feel accurate. I seriouslt just want to go sleep but I have school work to do and I’ll hate myself even more if I don’t do it. Happiness just feels so fake, like it’s something I could never achieve. I appreciate the positive things I hear, but no words do anything to me anymore. I always wanted to be a good person, and I think I have been throughout most of my life, but anymore I can tell that people are seeing less of that, and I am too. I don’t like who I’ve become, I just hate how little control I’ve been able to have over it. I feel guilt for saying all of this, as I know others have it worse. I feel like such a horrible person. It’s not normal depression, this has lasted for so long, I really do think I’m starting to go insane. I think I have been for a long time, staring during that relationship. I have too little energy to correct any of what i wrote, and I’m going to feel regret and guilt and self hate posting this or not posting this, so I’ll just post it anyway and maybe edit things eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch," Hey everyone,

I am a 25 year old Veteran who suffers from severe clinical depression. I am an atheist (specifically agnostic-theist). About 2 years ago I went through a divorce that crippled my self esteem, trust, and in some ways my faith in humanity.

Nowadays I remotely go to college, have very little in person interactions and self-isolate quite a bit, and communicate with my friends primarily virtually whenever I am social. A large part of this has to do with the destruction of my self esteem leading me into a dark hole of self destructive habits that have made me have even lower self esteem (think body dysmorphia/over-eating from anxiety, etc.).

Anyhow, onto the main subject at hand, Nihilism. I find myself slowly creeping towards thoughts that enable or make it easier for me to commit suicide. More specifically, my thoughts go something like this:

Well... Life is fundamentally pointless in the grand scheme of things. As far as I know, everything I will ever do, regret not doing, known, etc. will cease to exist. Some things are inevitable. It is inevitable I will die and when I die someone will be emotionally hurt (regardless of when or how I die). This leads me to think that if I end my own life and people are sad that it was inevitable and therefore, it makes no difference when or how I die. I will not care about anything after I die, just like I didn't care about anything before I existed, the same is true of everyone I ever have and will know.

As it stands now, I live to work and exist to fall short of my own expectations. I am but a shell of my former self, a worse version than I previously was. I am damaged. In several ways I feel like I am a burden to others... This world is cruel, so cruel, that I could not believe a God exists; or rather, that one worthy of worship exists.

I cannot identify the point or purpose in my existence, even if I could, I could not quantify it past a finite timeline and therefore it leads me to believe anything I could have contributed to humanity would have been inevitably forgotten, pointless, and meaningless.

The only ""counter-argument"" I've been able to come up with is that it is equally as pointless to die as it is to live; however, that doesn't really help. If that were true, then I feel like I'd choose the one that I simply prefer over the other if they are of equal truth (in this case death because then I wouldn't be forced to suffer this existence).

This is a throwaway and I've blocked my girlfriend from here. She knows my main account name so that's why I'm using a throwaway. It was originally  created for an unrelated [r/TrueOffMyChest](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/) post but I never deleted this account so I'm using it for this now that I've deleted all posts and comments.

Anyway, let's get into the story.

My  girlfriend (Rachel) and I have been together 1 year and 3 months (it'll  be 3 months on April 1). We met in the college we both currently  attend. Shortly into the relationship Rachel confessed feelings of  suicide to me. After discussing them with her for a little while, I went  over her head and told her older sister (22F). Her sister told their  mother. Her mother immediately spoke with Rachel and got her therapy.

I  often say, and Rachel agrees, I'm the reason she's in therapy, and I'm  proud of my decisiveness there, which could have saved her life.

Note that I stopped hearing about suicide for months after the therapy began, and I continued to support her as best I could.

**BIG PROBLEM:** Rachel hasn't told the therapist (Jeanine) that Rachel got therapy  because of suicidal thoughts and it's been MONTHS. 1-2 weeks ago, Rachel  told me again that the suicidal feelings have come back stronger due to  a stressful situation that we're both suffering, but she hasn't told Jeanine that either.

I should mention that Rachel's known for ***months*** that she would kill herself with the guns her dad keeps in the house.  When she told me this second time, I had a minor breakdown and cried and  couldn't get the mental image of Rachel's blood and brains coating a wall in the family house, of Rachel's mom finding her in the morning, of her mom messaging my mom on Facebook to let her know Rachel is dead...

Rachel  said she's embarrassed of her suicidal thoughts, and she often feels  guilty for burdening her own therapist with her problems. I reminded her  that's Jeanine's job and Jeanine said one day ""I'm going to go to  school so I can become a therapist and listen to Rachel's problems"" (a  bit of an exaggeration but I was trying to lighten the mood).

Rachel  went to another therapy session last week and still hasn't told the  therapist. I asked Rachel to send me a screenshot of an email that  Jeanine sent Rachel recommending various therapy services I could use  (I'm under a lot of stress and could use therapy) and as many  professionals do, Jeanine included her name and title and work phone  number at the bottom of the email.

WIBTA  if I called the phone number and told Jeanine ""I'm Rachel's boyfriend  and I'm only telling you this for Rachel's benefit and safety: Rachel  only got therapy with you because she was having suicidal thoughts, but  they went away during the therapy. However, due to the stressful  situation we're suffering **\[Jeanine already knows about it\]** the suicidal thoughts have returned and she has a method of committing suicide planned out""?

I  don't think so but since the topic is so sensitive and private and  serious, I want to make sure before I continue. Rachel is not in *imminent*  danger because I can tell she still has hope she and I might live  together one day, but 1-2 weeks ago, when she reiterated having suicidal  thoughts, that was the lowest she's ever felt.

Also,  an alternate plan I'm considering is letting Rachel tell Jeanine on her  own terms -- give her an ultimatum: ""Rachel, I have Jeanine's work  phone number and if you don't tell her about the suicidal thoughts during your next session, I'm going to do it by phone.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 21, male. I was born in a third-world country and I barely have a ""family"" of three between me and my parents. I was diagnosed with scoliosis around 15, and my curve is now 50 - doctor decided I didn't need surgery.

I've been majorly depressed ever since I was 12, and I do not recall any previous events in my life before that period.

My parents were never really present for me and I raised myself infront of the computer, I self-taught myself English that way.

I always had and still have a hard time fitting in with anyone or anywhere at all, I just always liked different things that I guess most other people weren't into, and if they were, they just weren't onto me.

I've had dissociative thoughts on and off, I've often felt used to the point that I just accept being a stepping stone in other people's pursuit of happiness.

I'm lower middle class in a rather shitty country and there isn't much opportunity to do much about it either. I'm in my fourth year of college (it's free here) and I feel like it's all pointless.

Essentially, I'd like to move elsewhere and start my life. I've lived a very sheltered life trapped in the jail cell that is my room for over two decades. I always hear from my other IRL friends or friends online about a bunch of experiences and places they went and things they did that just sound like ""movie things"" to me, like that's not real life for me. It's the same when I hear of anyone I know having a good connection or relationship with their parents.

I always feel like life is ready to throw something at me and never allow me to enjoy anything, as anytime anything even slightly good happens to me, there's a good hit short after kicking me back. I've never given up and I've always tried to be for others the person that I wish I had there for me. I've picked up hobbies, I learned guitar and bass, I love arts and music, I find life and people utterly interesting.

I feel as if I was trapped in a cage. I'm in a cage in the middle of some plains that I can stare out of. I see everyone being happy and having a good time and just a great luck with the life they got, but I'm just trapped here to spectate.

I'm at the bottom of a well, and people come by from the tunnel, I'll kneel over and help them out, but when I turn around to see if anyone reaches to pull me up, there's nothing.

I try to learn and expand my views and thoughts on life, I really think there's a lot of amazing and wonderful things to see, feel, do and experience... but I feel like not everyone gets to see that. And I'm not someone who does.

I've started getting back pain rather often, and neither I nor my family can even begin to afford the surgery, not to say if it'd even work given my luck. I'm starting to feel like I have erectile dysfunction. I'm anxious about life. I feel as if life is just ""a carrot on a stick"", I always kept going on this promise that if I work hard and try to be a good person that things would be better, but they never have. I've long given up expecting anything, but it's getting really hard to even fathom existing.

I'm glad that I'm me and that it isn't someone else in my place, I wouldn't wish this upon anybody.

I've always tried to do, make, and teach things for others, and often I've improved the life of those whose life was far better than my own.

But I can of just can't take it anymore. I'm scared at the thought of killing myself, cause I want to live, but I feel like I am not able to. I feel like maybe my life isn't worth the hassle. I'll work hard to barely get what others were born with. And even then, all my physical or genetical and psychological issues and scars will always remain.

I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I'm a bad person, but I just can't take this. I don't know. I'm sure there's people who have it worse, I'm sure there's people who have it better. I feel selfish killing myself with all the things I've gotten from others in both time, materials, and money, but I'm just suffering all of the time. I also just feel selfish taking up space in the world when I may just off myself, or that I'm just a waste of time. I have a wonderful partner, but I feel like I'll just be a drag to them, I feel like they can have better and I don't want to waste their time or life.

I feel like my issues are far too deep to ever be addressed or fixed. I don't feel any impulsive or emotional feelings anymore, I'm cold and technical. I'm abstract and I feel like I'm just on spectator mode. I can think of things but I can not feel anything.

&lt;p&gt;I always had and still have a hard time fitting in with anyone or anywhere at all, I just always liked different things that I guess most other people weren&amp;#39;t into, and if they were, they just weren&amp;#39;t onto me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had dissociative thoughts on and off, I&amp;#39;ve often felt used to the point that I just accept being a stepping stone in other people&amp;#39;s pursuit of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lower middle class in a rather shitty country and there isn&amp;#39;t much opportunity to do much about it either. I&amp;#39;m in my fourth year of college (it&amp;#39;s free here) and I feel like it&amp;#39;s all pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I&amp;#39;d like to move elsewhere and start my life. I&amp;#39;ve lived a very sheltered life trapped in the jail cell that is my room for over two decades. I always hear from my other IRL friends or friends online about a bunch of experiences and places they went and things they did that just sound like &amp;quot;movie things&amp;quot; to me, like that&amp;#39;s not real life for me. It&amp;#39;s the same when I hear of anyone I know having a good connection or relationship with their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always feel like life is ready to throw something at me and never allow me to enjoy anything, as anytime anything even slightly good happens to me, there&amp;#39;s a good hit short after kicking me back. I&amp;#39;ve never given up and I&amp;#39;ve always tried to be for others the person that I wish I had there for me. I&amp;#39;ve picked up hobbies, I learned guitar and bass, I love arts and music, I find life and people utterly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if I was trapped in a cage. I&amp;#39;m in a cage in the middle of some plains that I can stare out of. I see everyone being happy and having a good time and just a great luck with the life they got, but I&amp;#39;m just trapped here to spectate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the bottom of a well, and people come by from the tunnel, I&amp;#39;ll kneel over and help them out, but when I turn around to see if anyone reaches to pull me up, there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to learn and expand my views and thoughts on life, I really think there&amp;#39;s a lot of amazing and wonderful things to see, feel, do and experience... but I feel like not everyone gets to see that. And I&amp;#39;m not someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started getting back pain rather often, and neither I nor my family can even begin to afford the surgery, not to say if it&amp;#39;d even work given my luck. I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I have erectile dysfunction. I&amp;#39;m anxious about life. I feel as if life is just &amp;quot;a carrot on a stick&amp;quot;, I always kept going on this promise that if I work hard and try to be a good person that things would be better, but they never have. I&amp;#39;ve long given up expecting anything, but it&amp;#39;s getting really hard to even fathom existing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad that I&amp;#39;m me and that it isn&amp;#39;t someone else in my place, I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish this upon anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always tried to do, make, and teach things for others, and often I&amp;#39;ve improved the life of those whose life was far better than my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can of just can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I&amp;#39;m scared at the thought of killing myself, cause I want to live, but I feel like I am not able to. I feel like maybe my life isn&amp;#39;t worth the hassle. I&amp;#39;ll work hard to barely get what others were born with. And even then, all my physical or genetical and psychological issues and scars will always remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m a bad person, but I just can&amp;#39;t take this. I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s people who have it worse, I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s people who have it better. I feel selfish killing myself with all the things I&amp;#39;ve gotten from others in both time, materials, and money, but I&amp;#39;m just suffering all of the time. I also just feel selfish taking up space in the world when I may just off myself, or that I&amp;#39;m just a waste of time. I have a wonderful partner, but I feel like I&amp;#39;ll just be a drag to them, I feel like they can have better and I don&amp;#39;t want to waste their time or life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my issues are far too deep to ever be addressed or fixed. I don&amp;#39;t feel any impulsive or emotional feelings anymore, I&amp;#39;m cold and technical. I&amp;#39;m abstract and I feel like I&amp;#39;m just on spectator mode. I can think of things but I can not feel anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was at rock bottom and I was getting closer to kms each passing day I saw people walk away from me, choosing this path. I don't blame them, as I would probably do the same in their situation.

Before this, my mom had committed suicide… my sister was 13 and I was 17. At first, people had some compassion, but after two years things change.  The story no longer sticks and they expect you to be happy.  What was once a sad story turns into something boring. I've had to deal with a lot of  things after that - my father showing up ten years later interested in my mother's inventory and disappearing again after seeing that it was no big deal,  my uncles giving me shelter (I'm very grateful), but always suspicious that I show a terrible side that they always assume I have hidden.  As my aunt said: “ one fucked up mother makes two fucked up daughters.” But… I have a lot to thank my uncles for.  Because of them, I'm not an orphan on the street and I'm able to go to college (other uncles get involved, they're investing in me by paying for college).  But when I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized because I asked for help before I kms I was criticized a lot by my uncles (both those who shelter me and those who pay for college) saying that I was victimizing myself, that I took a vacation to think about life, that I was just lazy and was pitting myself. I’m sure it wasn’t self pity. I just really hate myself. 
Now my sister is in an addiction clinic.  My uncles didn't know how to deal with her temper and lack of respect, often caused to get attention or run away from reality. My uncles made it clear that we only gave them problems and that they were very good people for sheltering us.  My grandparents blamed my sister for my mother's death (she was already using drugs at that time which was the initial trigger for my mother to get worse; however I know it will never be or was my sister's fault - she was just a child and nobody is responsible for the life of the other, mainly for a figure of greater power - our parents). Everyone was saying that everything we had is because of they goodwill.
I can't even get out of my hole and now I have to bear the responsibility of taking care of my sister.  The responsibility was left to me as I am the closest person.  My uncles didn't consult me ​​and they just threw her in a place I don't know... and now that everything got worse, after I visited my sister (we found out that she was already very ill and was hanging out with some not very nice people from the clinic). I don’t know why she did this to herself… well I’m no better example. I’m a garbage of people…  She relied on my father, she thinks he is the only one that understands her and will get an emancipation with him and get our apartment ( this was my mother n it’s with my grandparent, since he claims it’s his, because he gave it to my mother, but in the law it’s my mother apartment).When I talked to her last week I see how blinded she is. She covered herself in arrogance, thinking that everything she is doing is right and my uncles is only at fault. I love her, n that’s why it shatters my soul to see her blinding herself from her actions and reality.

The truth is, most don&amp;#39;t have the energy to listen to your shit and you&amp;#39;ll have to deal with it alone or die miserably.
Fuck this life.
I’ll try my best to stay in it, and love the people around me. But I know… if I get worse again - they will leave. And I ll be in the dark contemplating if one day I will be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

i always say you should do things in life that give you more positives than negatives. for example, if my mother stresses me out to the point where it outweighs the positive impact of having a mom - i will simply stop engaging with her. if my relationship brings me more arguments and tears than laughter and love - i will simply walk away.

so, following that logic... if my life is more difficult and painful than beautiful and fun - im going to end it.

,SuicideWatch,"i don’t even think this is true, it could be sooner, later, or never for all i know. i just know that right now i do not want to be alive anymore. i feel like i’m at the lowest point in my life and wow, it sucks. everything that i was hoping for to go well is plummeting so fast. 

i’m a college freshman right now and of course i believed that college was going to be the best years of my life. i could finally learn how to be independent and study something that would make my parents proud. i think i jumped into college doing what i thought my parents expected of me, so maybe that’s why i fell into a deep depression (undiagnosed). i couldn’t be bothered to do any work or study, barely ate and left my room, and spent the days sleeping as much as i could. every day my mom would call me and ask how it went and what i had done and every day i lied to her face, being the most pathetic and disgusting daughter i am. very recently i started opening up how i felt about college to my parents and had thought of taking a temporary leave (i just signed the papers yesterday). my parents are good people, maybe put a bit too much pressure on me but i know it’s for my best interests. so telling them that i wanted to leave school even for a bit showed me how disappointed they are in me. i’m not making this up either, in the car ride with my mom to my college we were talking about how the withdrawal process worked, and she brought up how upset my dad is in me. i’m so sorry and i know saying it isn’t enough.

&lt;p&gt;i’m a college freshman right now and of course i believed that college was going to be the best years of my life. i could finally learn how to be independent and study something that would make my parents proud. i think i jumped into college doing what i thought my parents expected of me, so maybe that’s why i fell into a deep depression (undiagnosed). i couldn’t be bothered to do any work or study, barely ate and left my room, and spent the days sleeping as much as i could. every day my mom would call me and ask how it went and what i had done and every day i lied to her face, being the most pathetic and disgusting daughter i am. very recently i started opening up how i felt about college to my parents and had thought of taking a temporary leave (i just signed the papers yesterday). my parents are good people, maybe put a bit too much pressure on me but i know it’s for my best interests. so telling them that i wanted to leave school even for a bit showed me how disappointed they are in me. i’m not making this up either, in the car ride with my mom to my college we were talking about how the withdrawal process worked, and she brought up how upset my dad is in me. i’m so sorry and i know saying it isn’t enough. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I wrote this all weeks ago just writing and rephrasing things, trying to word things right to make sure I get alot off my chest, and I just got the courage to actually post it. I know this is all a mess but I don’t know how to write and just overall express my feelings. Also I know this is all really embarrassing but I don’t know what else to do. I’m sorry for rambling alot, especially in the first half.

I made an account just with the intention of posting this to r/radicalfeminism but then I realized it might be a little inappropriate so I decided to post this here. I can’t tell you how scared I am of posting this because I know how people are but at this point I couldn’t care less

Also character limit is 40k but the original that I wanted to copy and paste here is more than 70. So I deleted alot of stuff but I posted the full version on instagram because I so badly want to get everything off my chest before killing myself

Sorry for any mistakes; not a native speaker.

Just an introduction, I’m still a teen, arab, live in the middle east, live with my dad and two younger brothers, a closeted ex muslim, bi and a VERY radical feminist (of course closeted too).

I can imagine myself actually writing one in real life and I bet you 100 percent that my family’s just gonna be upset over the fact that oh I’ve just been so brainwashed by the west and completely forgot Allah and my deen! I don’t know if you know what it’s like to be born in an arab muslim family, in a muslim country, in an islam brainwashed society, but it’s useless.

I’m just gonna say whatever comes to mind as I’m writing. I’ve had multiple suicide attempts and have been self harming for more than five years now. My entire life I never truly saw myself having a future. At the back of my mind I always kinda knew I wasn’t gonna make it far. I’ve wanted to die ever since I was a toddler. And throughout more than half of my life, the only thing that kept me away from ending it all was the fear of hell. I would have done anything to die and to put myself out of my misery, to just leave my head. It’s like I’m a dead soul in a living body. I feel like a corpse. 

I’ve never worried about future consequences and the thought of eternal doom in the future didn’t matter to me cuz there was no future that I wanted to be in.

I’ve always been so alone and have never had anybody ever. And after radicalization I realized I actually want no one. It’s so frustrating and irritating, having nobody but your head that you don’t even want, that you despise and want to get rid of.

My own family and parents have absolutely no idea who I am. Both of my parents have always known I wanted to die since I was born but neither know why or care, especially my mom. They actually find it so pathetic and have mocked me so many times. Ever since I came out the womb I’ve wanted to die. And the reasons kept increasing and increasing. 

First it was having to deal with family issues my entire life, then studying and bullying and overall school, then absolutely despising my appearance, then taking off the hijab, then becoming an ex muslim and questioning my entire existence and afterlife, then of course the cherry on top of getting introduced to radical feminism.

And on top of all that, since I came out of the womb I’ve had major depression. Have been struggling with immense agonizing loneliness and not having any people or friends or family that want me, not online or in real life.

My fear of people, my God awful concentration skills, fear of germs, extreme fear of bugs, my face and body, misophonia, and overall physical problems.

The only way I cope, is by daydreaming LITERALLY 24/7.

I genuinely wonder if I don’t committ suicide if it’s even possible for me to develop more problems.

Everything in this country is completely led and based on islam. Everyone’s mindset is set on islam, every moral, every everything.

The deafening sound of the adhan everyday reminding me that no matter what I do I’ll always be subordinate to this cult. The way I can’t even find any tampons here cuz they’re viewed as haram. How a man wearing tshirt and shorts is perfectly fine but a woman wearing the same is inappropriate and is ""naked"". I can’t relate to anyone here.

Everyone in this world is either a muslim or a muslim apologist that defends them. Muslim apologists will literally cry a river for whatever problems muslims claim to have. Seeing them defend islam, it’s disgusting. I can’t believe muslims actually believe their own oppressive bullshit. It hurts and it’s so disturbing and heartbreaking seeing muslim women respecting their own chains and even calling it empowering. And the majority have the guts to call islam feminist, it’s so crazy I can’t believe this world real. If people can proudly and openly say they hate pedophilia and that they’re anti racism or anti sexism and homophobia, how come I can’t say I hate islam? I can’t believe the word ""islamophobia"" is real. Like it’s used against anyone who doesn’t like their disgusting pedophilic, sexist shithole of a religion.

Islam is a representation of bigotry, like I can’t believe it. Islam is such a joke, it’s like misogyny and bigotry but make it religion. I can’t believe how people have the audacity to call it non-misogynistic yet alone feminist. Like I don’t get it but at the same time it’s so unsurprising. Out of any religion, of course it’s gonna be the most misogynistic one that everyone chooses to defend to the moon and back and call people bigots for hating it. I can’t put it into words how much I hate everything and to what degree I want to just disappear. I want to die.

But I get it, why men would be muslim. Women are muslim out of fear, whether they’re aware of it or not, but with men, they’re granted their little adolescent, eternal virgin sex slaves in Jannah and in every fucking aspect of islam men are seen and treated as superior. All the privileges they have. Allah loves men. Maybe except the homosexual man, because you know the kind of man that would degrade himself so much to lower himself down to a woman’s level. 

Everything in my life collapsed in my really short journey of becoming what muslim apologists would call an “islamophobe”.

I don’t want this world or any religions idea of what Jannah/heaven is. I hate everything and everyone. I just feel so alone. I literally have nobody. And if God is real, I hate him, what a sadistic, woman-hating, male supremacist, male-gendered god, that everyone refers to as he/him. Because you know, men are the default and women are abnormal subhumans. 

This world is such a joke, like there’s no way everyone is just so ok with bigotry. I don’t feel human anymore. Like not only have I never been treated as one, but I’m not even an adult yet and I’ve already set my morals. So how come others haven’t realized the so insanely oppressive world that they live in? Oh wait nobody actually cares. I can’t believe that I’m actually a living person, I feel so subhuman. 

Aside from depression, I’ve never went to get anything diagnosed.

I have this constant headache that I’ve had for as long as I can remember that just can’t seem to go away. No matter how much I’ve slept I never feel well rested. And I just overall feel chronic pain all around my body. Always feeling fatigued and tired. Just so uncomfortable all the time, that’s what my normal is. 

I have a giant fear of people and I absolutely dread interacting with them, doesn’t matter who the person is.

Like I try so hard to get people to just not hate me, to treat me okay, but no matter what I do it never works. It doesn’t matter who it is. It makes me believe that that’s just who I am and it’s inevitable for me to not be treated this way. It doesn’t matter if it’s online or in real life. I don’t understand. 

No one’s ever cared about me the way I do for them. It really hurts it’s so painful. I don’t know why I’m always treated like fucking subhuman garbage. I want to die. 

I can’t make myself focus or concentrate no matter how hard I try. I try so hard to the point it physically hurts. I could literally read three pages of something then snap out of it and have no idea what I just read.

It’s so fucking frustrating not knowing what’s wrong with me. I just constantly feel irritated, physically and emotionally. Everything is so hard. It’s so exhausting. 

I have so much struggle with nightmares and sleeping. And it doesn’t matter whether I sleep two hours or fifteen hours, I feel so tired. 

I’m a daydreamer and all I do 24/7 is pretend I’m living in a different world. I don’t remember a time in my life where I wasn’t doing it literally all day. It is alllll I have done my entire life. An example, while I’ve been writing this entire thing I’m just imagining a different me, in a different universe talking about all of this to imaginary people, and venting to them and having them relate to me and understand me. And I do this all the time, just venting to imaginary people. It’s my way of escaping. I feel so stupid. So many times a day I get up from bed just to pace around my room imagining universes where bigotry doesn’t exist. Where I’m a different person and I look and sound beautiful, a universe where I look and sound like what I actually wish I did. Like with the times (honestly like 70% of the time) that I’m imagining that I still live in this world, except the majority of people are accepting of rad feminism and like 50% percent of women are already peaked. But it’s all in my head and none of it is/will ever be real unfortunately. 

I have, without a doubt, spent more of my life daydreaming than I have living in reality. It’s basically my substitute to living. It’s the only thing I have control over. I get to decide how the world is, what I look like, sound like, how others are, how I’m treated.

But then reality hits me and I realize that isn’t actually how the world is, I’m not actually that person, her face and body aren’t mine, the people aren’t my friends or family, they aren’t real people who love me and care for me, that world isn’t real and real people aren’t like that. It feels like my mind is ruining itself. But as always, all I have to do is ignore this and daydream again and it all resets and continues, the cycle of escaping my agonizing reality, living in a comfortable world, and just daydream for 95% of the day everyday. And my life just becomes more and more unbearable. Just completely out of touch with reality. I’m living in my head that’s what it is. It’s the only thing stable in my life. 

Just listening to sad songs or certain type of music, or the usual songs I listen to, make me feel so fucking depressed and just make me wanna crawl out of my skin I hate it so much. Like it just sends this wave of agonizing depression reminding me of how sad I actually am. It’s just this intense sadness and emptiness that won’t go away. That’s all I feel, either overwhelming sadness or overwhelming numbness. I want to die. I’m not afriad of death, but I am so scared of the actual process of dying. I wish it was as easy as pressing a button. 

I get frustrated really easily and it always leads me to crying. I can’t control or manage my emotions. And it feels like every emotion I feel, I feel it a hundred times more intensely than other people. Little things that other people usually just brush off, send me into emotional tailspins that last forever. I just feel empty and numb. I really don’t feel like a person. 

I’m a very disliked person, I’ve just never been liked. I personally don’t believe in stuff like energy, but I seriously don’t know why ever since I was a fucking toddler nobody ever wanted me. No family, friends, not online, not anywhere. I’ve never ever had anyone or anyone to talk to. I’ve just been bottling up everything and suffering without fucking anybody even knowing a glimpse of what I’m going through. I tried when I was really young, like really young. I used to threaten suicide and would repeatedly say I wanted to die. Absolutely nobody cared. I was just a little drama queen to everyone, and that’s how I’m still viewed. No one could care any less. I don’t understand what it is. If it’s not energy or whatever then what is it? I know it’s partially my looks and voice but then what about online?

I get zero messages and have absolutely nobody to talk to. No one but myself. 

And even in the hypothetical chance I had the ability to make a friend, the only time I can actually see myself having a friend and liking them, is if they’re well versed in radfem theory. And I can’t peak anyone, like what am I gonna do, give them an obligatory reading list? And I think it goes without saying that even then, this would only be the case online. Cuz it’s not like I have any options, plus I wouldn’t want anyone in real life anyway.

There’s nothing about me I don’t despise. I hate my body and overall appearance. From head to toe I wish I looked different. I hate my appearance so much words can’t describe it. My face, my skin color, hair, body hair, voice, scars, skin. I wish I had my ideal face and body. I wish I had a way different voice. My feminism just thrown out the window when it comes to all this, I know. But I just can’t help but fucking hate everything about myself. I wish I had plain white skin, different nose, different voice, smaller and different eyes, silky straight hair, wider different mouth, different cheekbones, different brows, smaller different boobs, different jaw, different forehead, less chubby cheeks, different legs, different feet, different torso, no scars, taller height, flawless skin. My face and body are the embodiment of everything I hate. I would replace everything. 

There are so many embarrassing things about my appearance that I’m not gonna mention bcuz I’m too ashamed and embarrassed. Even if this is online. Having others that thankfully don’t know what I look like, get an idea of it, isn’t something I want.

I can’t play more than 90 percent of the games I used to play or watch the shows or anime or anything anymore cuz the second I see misogyny or bigotry I get so pissed and couldn’t care less if misogyny aside, the thing I was watching or playing was good. And this applies to music too. I am so fucking devastated.

How do you guys do it? I’ve only just got introduced to radical feminism and got radicalized not even two years ago, and I’m already so so sooo fucking done with this woman-hating garbage world. Maybe it’s because I’m already a broken human and have been all my life but I just genuinely cannot fathom this world. Like how? I’m still a teen and am so confused as to how I wasn’t radicalized wayyyy sooner. I can’t fathom how for thousands and thousands of years this is how things have been, and are only getting way worse. How are there not riots full of angry women all around the world? How is not EVERYONE radical?

Sexism is the oldest form of oppression and for thousands of years it still remains the worst form. And nothing is being done about it, it’s only getting worse. 

How can gender still be a thing? And how do people defend it? How is islam a real religion that has existed for more than a thousand years, has more than one billion followers and has the entire world defend and adore it? How is kink a thing? And how do people defend it and not find it so fucking absurd and just absolutely disgusting and not throw up in the mouth thinking about it?

Like with things like gender I understand needing a little bit of learning to understand why it’s terrible and needs to be abolished, but with other things, the misogyny is so blatantly obvious it’s painful!! It’s right there!! How do you not see???How does it not completely and utterly disgust you?

I have no place in this world. Anyone that even dares to think about anything ""negative"" about all the things you SHOULD hate, that you SHOULD despise, if you hate it, you’re a bigot. It’s like irony at its finest. There are fucking labels that were created on top of all of this. Jesus christ the irony. 

You hate islam? Islamophobe. You’re rightfully angry at men? Misandrist. You hate gender? Terf. You hate kink? Kinkshamer.

And again, as if these are negative things!! This is how everyone should be. This is basic human fucking decency. 

Gosh these words. These fucking words that they created to use against anyone who doesn’t accept their blatantly misogynistic, pedophilic, bigoted disgusting pile of oppressive bullshit ideologies. 

There are zero words in the entire english vernacular to describe how much I fucking hate these ideologies and anyone who defends them. 

Shitty world where women are viewed and treated as subhuman made to please men. How everyone is treating men as animals and women like their caretakers but view it as if it were the other way around.

The fact that men can openly admit to getting aroused off of women’s abuse and oppression, that it gives them pleasure, and people are more than accepting about it. It it so disturbing. Men find our abuse arousing. Jesus christ. The way it’s viewed as moral and even ""empowering"" for a woman to be verbally and physically degraded, slapped, strangled, hit, spat on, just dehumanized, completely stripped of her humanity for the sake of ""kink"". How men can get their hatred out on us, excuse their misogyny, pedophilia, racism, beastiality, whatever it is, it’s all just justified for the sake of a man’s pleasure. And when men spread their porn-poisoned minds to women and children, suddenly it’s excused as ""kink"" and that it’s natural. Men regularly consuming hours after hours of women being dehumanized and degraded, getting aroused off of it. We are worthless in their eyes, our abuse is entertainment to them. But yknow, didn’t the woman consent? Did she not choose to be dehumanized? Did she not say yes? Is it not between two consenting adults? Is there not a safeword? Is there not aftercare? This is traumatizing. 

Millions, hell probably billions, of men finding pleasure in any woman’s pain, and society as a whole sees nothing wrong with that? None of this seems real to me.

I am so aware of everything that I see and hear, it’s insufferable. Like all the misogyny I hear and see feel like direct attacks to me. Like it all hits one million times harder. I can’t even listen to music anymore. The sexist slurs and the hinting at sadomasochism/kink constantly getting traumatized and reminded of how sick everyone (men) is. And just the way men talk about women and even the way women talk about themselves. Like I can’t listen to a song and enjoy it for what it is cuz the creator identifies with or defends TRAs, or has wrote a sexist song/lyrics. It’s so fucking stupid. I can’t watch any anime or play most games anymore or even fucking talk to people who like it cuz there’s these two things that once I noticed I couldn’t ever unsee it. 

I’ve been bottling up all my feelings and pain inside myself since I came out the womb. I don’t have and have never had anybody, not online, not in real life, not anywhere. I’ve just been lonely and alone my entire life. Nobody to talk to and share my depression with. And I don’t want anyone now. I hate everyone and everything. I’m dealing with stuff I can’t even find others dealing with. After radicalization, I see misogyny and bigotry in everything, like everything. Even things I used to enjoy. Anime, games, music, etc. Whatever it is, you name it. I can’t enjoy anything. Like imagine someone telling you all anime, games and cartoons are bigoted. You’ll think they’re deranged. I hate it.

After radicalization I threw away anything that ""triggered"" me. All my posters, figurines, consoles, pc and of course the games within them.

The only ""hobbies"" I had, the amount of money and time spent on them, just all in the trash. I used to literally own thousands of dollars worth of figurines alone, so it hurt to know all that money could’ve been saved if I just hadn’t been a degenerate.

As I said at the beginning of the year I threw away all of my stuff, so I can’t even play the games I used to spend 90% of day playing. So I have absolutely nothing to do. Along with throwing away everything, I have nothing on my phone. A couple of months ago I deleted basically everything off my phone, my entire camera roll and all the notes I had. Full of my passwords and the majority was just a very, very, long suicide message I was gonna send to both my parents. Like 30 notes that I spent like six months writing until I realized it literally does not fucking matter. Before, my entire camera roll was literally only just pictures of women and girls with looks I envied. Daydream about having them. I would rather be anyone else. I hate myself so much.

My entire life I had never truly saw myself having a future. Cutting myself carelessly wishing I would accidentally cut an artery. Went from hoarding to throwing away things and memories I once coveted. Throwing away all the furniture in my room aside from bed, bedside table and mirror. Quitting school in highschool after all the years of hard work and depression of being forced to go and study. Never caring about my health whether mental or physical. Daydreaming 24/7 never considering reality unless I had to.

Ever since hating my looks, absolutely despising it, I thought I had REALLY lost all hope, cuz no amount of surgery will I ever make me look like the ideal woman I want to look like. (And you know, at the back of mind I’ve always hated my looks, it was just the realizing it part.) But then becoming an ex Muslim and questioning the afterlife and getting into rad feminism was when I actually knew it really can’t get worse. Becoming aware of misogyny and bigotry hurts so much. Like nothing bothers me more than casual misogyny. I can’t live normally. 

And I genuinely feel more upset and angry at women than I do at men. We have absolutely no class solidarity. Handmaidens everywhere. Religious women, liberal women, TIFs. That’s like more than 99 percent of the female population. Women are spending their entire lives fighting for male acceptance. Why is no one willing to do something? I know this whole thing isn’t our fault, it’s not remotely our fault, but if these women actually fucking cared about themselves and other women, they’d do something about it. Instead they put down other women and would do basically ANYTHING to defend and justify female oppression. Literally worshipping male supremacy and patriarchy. There is no hope. I’m just so tired. We aren’t viewed as human beings deserving of empathy and dignity. True liberation does not even seem fathomable.

The way men are hiding their hatred of women behind this thin veil called ""religion"", ""preference"", ""kink"".

How when men are oppressed, it’s tragedy. But when women are oppressed, it’s religion, culture, tradition, biology, sex, preference, a choice.

Ever since I discovered radical feminism everything went downhill in a way I never thought it could. Obviously not in the sense that I regret getting into it, it’s just the realization of the world we live in. It is built by men, for men, from top to bottom. Women don’t and cannot benefit from it in any way shape or form. 

You see misogyny in your father, mother, relatives, school/work, stores, music, games, shows, books. 

And I know it sounds stupid but to just think about all the women that had to give up their dreams and aspirations just to become the kind of woman patriarchy told them to be. My heart aches beyond belief. 

I just feel really out of touch with reality. I don’t have a sense of self. It feels I’ve switched from being one person to another. Like the way my morals and values completely changed. Like to me I consider my radicalization both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because holy shit it felt like I’ve opened my third eye. Going from a severely misogynistic Muslim conservative who defended pedophilia and racism, to someone who literally cries wishing hell existed so I could rest assured people who are like who I used to be all burn in it. And it’s a curse because, just like what Dworkin said, it’s an agony to be fully and intimately conscious of all the brutal misogyny that’s quite literally ingrained in every single part of the world. There is no escape from it. 

From the beginning of getting radicalized and realizing just how crooked this world is, I found myself googling stuff like ""radfem suicide"" just to see, who else? Because I cannot imagine not getting severally depressed being so conscious of misogyny, especially as a woman. But of course all that came up when I searched stuff like that were very triggering (cuz all are to me) anti radfem posts and articles.

It’s like wherever you go, racism here, colorism there, kink this porn that, religion this gender that. And liberal feminism rhetoric everywhere. It just doesn’t go away. Nowhere. This world has no place for liberated women. I open my phone, and BOOM a reference to kink, a misogynistic slur here and there, video with a misogynistic song playing in the background, trans or muslim ""representation"". Heck even someone saying LGBT/LGBTQ instead of just LGB triggers me. And again, liberal feminist rhetoric quite literally everywhere.

Critical thinking skills and logic are seen as bigotry. I want to die. 

Every minute my day gets worse. Just reading femicide news and looking at statistics. Jfc the amount of women getting raped and killed. I don’t understand.

What am I supposed to do about any of this? Go to a therapist? No person is gonna help me with this. They’ll think I’m a crazy bigot. And even if in the hypothetical chance I leave the country, and it was another woman who felt the same way I did, what’s she gonna do? Telling her I don’t like the amount of women getting raped. I don’t like the amount of women getting killed. I don’t like how women’s abuse is considered sexy. I don’t like how pedophilia and bigotry are considered sexy. I don’t like the amount of religions just based on controlling women. I don’t like gender. I don’t like that women are viewed and treated as subhuman. I don’t like that women are pressured and made to feel the need to shave every inch of their bodies. I don’t like that women are breaking their faces and mutilating their bodies all for the sake of male acceptance. I don’t like that women are pressured and made to feel the need to coat their entire faces in liquids and powders just for male approval. I don’t like that women are considered either private or public property. I don’t like that women are seen as objects to be used. And most importantly, I hate that 99.99 percent of women aren’t aware of this or just simply don’t care. This world DESPISES radfems. Like everything I stand by and believe in, people see it as full on bigotry.

This world is so fucking rotten and wicked. Just garbage. 

I hate being a woman, or specifically the consequences that come with it. I cut my hair that used to be hips length, wear clothing twice my size, let my bangs and hair cover as much of face as possible, just avoiding anything stereotypically ""girly"". Just anything to hide that I’m female. Anything to avoid male eyes on me thinking the worst of me. But hopefully after I die, by islams definition of the end of the world on judgment day, I’m gonna have to make myself be forgiven for being female. 

I envy men so much. I’m so so jealous of their freedom. But at the same time I don’t wish that I was a man. It’s so sick, I can’t ever imagine being a man and being ok with all these privileges that I have. I don’t know how men do it. How much men hate women, it is incomprehensible. The only thing worse is the betrayal of some women. Women really have no idea how much men hate us. I’m devastated. I couldn’t dehumanize men if I wanted.

In the early days of getting radicalized, I was so angry at men that I genuinely, truly tried to disregard them. Individually and as a whole. Disregard their opinions, the stuff they had to say and what they thought. Just tried to completely strip them of their humanity. Consciously making the decision to try and dehumanize and objectify them. But I failed every single time. I felt so utterly disgusted and revolted by myself. I could not help but feel empathy for them and value their dignity. I really don’t know how men do it. 

I don’t know how to dehumanize someone like that, to objectify a living being. It is so difficult for me to comprehend this level of apathy and degeneracy. I assume that’s because I’m a woman and I have the ability to genuinely care, love and feel empathy for others.

I know that you can bring the most radical, the most man-hating woman that there is and her hatred for men will still not equate to the average mans hatred for women.

We’ll never be free. Humanity will die with women being more oppressed than ever. 

I wish I lacked critical thinking skills. Everyone seems so ok. 

You don’t understand the amount of despair, hopelessness and depression I have in me. How so sad I get getting reminded that today isn’t my last day alive. I don’t want to wake up it’s scary. I cry over the thought of ""tomorrow"". I want to die. I want to disappear. I just want peace, I want to die. I hate everyone and everything so much. I want to die. Everyday is so fucking exhausting. I am so fucking tired.

I know that I’ll regret saying any of this since I always come out of any vent somehow more hopeless than before. In which my ""vents"" in context are literally like a one in a year message to my dad saying ""I want to die"" or a long ass paragraph that he probably doesn’t even bother reading, and him leaving me on read.

Somehow everyday I get more and more hopeless and filled with despair. I don’t think anyone understands even a little bit of how much I want to so desperately cease out of existence. I’m so so lonely and alone. I’ve been like this since I was a toddler. Things only just got worse and worse. And since I’m not underweight and don’t cut everyday, it doesn’t matter. If I don’t look as sick as I feel then it doesn’t matter right? Even though someone could literally slice my leg off and burn my eyes, and that physical pain would still not equate to 0.1 percent of the mental pain I’m in. Everyday is pure agony, every second, every minute, every hour. I always feel like crying but nothing comes out of my eyes. I can’t describe how I feel. I can’t explain it verbally or in any way really. I can’t tell you the amount of pain I’m in, just the pain I get of reminding myself today isn’t the last day I’m alive and that I’ll wake up tomorrow. This thought is always on my mind, I just try to ignore it or else I’ll just shed a few tears and go back to trying to put that thought aside again by daydreaming about happiness and/or sadness that’ll lead to happiness.

But sometimes I can’t do that and that wave of depression is so strong that I can’t ignore it. It doesn’t matter what bullshit I try and distract myself with, that pit in my stomach just doesn’t go away. And the most frustrating part is that I think I’ve reached a point where it’s really hard for me to relieve myself from crying. I cry so easily over the simplest stuff, my entire life that’s been the case. But no amount of tears and pain and sleep can relieve even little bit of my suffering. In the times that I break down I only physically cry a little before trying to force myself to stop and try to numb away whatever I’m feeling. Cutting myself until there’s yellow fat bubbling out, until I get gaping cuts, until there’s so much clotting I can’t fit anymore, digging my nails into my scalp until there’s blood on my fingertips, scratching at my skin until it gets sticky, squeezing my flesh so hard it bruises, screaming into the pillow until my throat feels like sandpaper and my head feels like it’s about to explode. Until my entire body, inside and out, is aching with pain. Doing anything to feel anything. Just trying to relieve myself of this constant agonizing numbness. Just trying anything to fill the void in me but nothing ever works. 

I would rather be anyone else. Whoever is reading this, I envy you and your life so much. 

I’m so helpless. It’s so scary I hate it so much. I feel so hopeless. I want to die, I want to disappear. Everything is so exhausting. I am so bored of life. I want to die. The times in my life of hearing my dad or anyone say stuff like ""the future"" and talking and insinuating that I’ll still be alive by then. It makes me feel so lonely and misunderstood. Even if ""the future"" in context is just couple of days, weeks or, God forbid, years or months. The idea of still being alive just breaks me. I don’t have any thoughts or plans for the future. It makes me so mad it’s so irritating and frustrating, it’s indescribable. I hate everyone and everything. I’m so numb to everything. I’d do anything to feel anything. I don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t want to be me anymore. I want to die. I want to disappear, to cease out of existence. I want to die.

It’s like I’m telling you I want to disappear but at the same time it’s scary. Like seriously? I was just born to suffer like that? Put into a brutally woman-hating disgustingly bigoted world, be put in agony for the entirety of my existence, then die without a single soul knowing why or caring? I just I don’t know. I can’t tell you how much my heart hurts thinking that I’ll disappear after death. But at the same time, if there’s no other option than religion’s view of afterlife then I’ll gladly disappear.

I can’t tolerate uncertainty and I seriously cannot force myself to believe in any kind of heaven. I just believe that after death it’ll be like before you were born, just nothingness. And ""knowing"" that, or rather just believing in that, makes me so intensely sad. Any adjective I could use right now to describe how I feel would be really underestimating how sad and upset I really am. 

My hatred for my appearance is so much, that if hypothetically God existed, if I were to go to my ideal Heaven, no misogyny, no pedophilia, no colorism, racism or bigotry, eternal happiness for all, kind of heaven, if my looks &amp; voice don’t change to the way I want them now, I wouldn’t want that heaven, I would rather disappear.

And my god am I a hypocrite. If another woman was saying this I would one thousand percent not agree with her.

This is the first time I’ve ever talked about any of this. Only times I’ve ""talked"" about this is literally all day everyday in my head talking to imaginary people in imaginary worlds. 

I can’t even call myself a burden because I make no difference in anyone’s life. Dead or alive, wouldn’t make a difference. I’m just this thing that breathes and sleeps living in the background of my dad’s life. 

When I was muslim I used to try and make myself feel better by saying that I’ll get justice on the day of judgement. That every person that has ever wronged me, Allah would tell them how much they’ve wronged me. But to know that I’ve lived to suffer and just die like that makes my heart ache. 

Suicide before becoming a legal adult is inevitable to me. I have no plans for living after that. And I’m really contemplating doing it before eid this year. Ramadan is starting in really early April and I can’t imagine how hard fasting and pretending to still be Muslim is gonna be. And I’m not even talking about the fasting part, it’s just the constant reminder that I’m doing it for this insanely misogynistic ""God"", and having my dad/family think I’m doing it cuz I’m Muslim. Being surrounded by muslim apologists everywhere is so painful.

My only plan really is to just not drink water and maybe even no food until I just die without even knowing it. Which apparently takes less than a week. I’ve already went multiple days in the past without water and/or food so I’m really not anticipating THE worst. It’s just a matter of when to me. Inshallah after all my failures of a suicide, I can guarantee death this time. I can’t believe after all my life I had had this ""hope"" it’s all just gone down the drain in my very short journey of becoming an ex muslim and getting introduced to radfeminism.

I feel like a broken record with the amount of times I’ve just spent daydreaming about venting about my problems, which is like 80 percent of my daydreaming fantasies. 

It’s always either overwhelming numbness or sadness. And the feeling is so intense it’s unbearable. It’s beyond my control. And nothing is relieving me from any of this. 

Often times when I was muslim it didn’t really matter whether I was crying, breaking down, on the verge of suicide, I’d always tell myself I’m gonna die and go to Jannah. Jannah was my only motivation for living. Since anything is possible there, it was basically the only thing I would think about. I can’t tell you the amount of euphoria and plain happiness that I used to feel ""knowing"" that my daydreams right now, in dunya, will become a reality in Jannah. Like depressed as hell just daydreaming about how all this will become a reality one day. 

I can’t tell you how fucking badly I wish my ideal heaven was real. There’s no words to express how devastated I am. Just completely broken.

Everyday I get filled with regret for not ending it sooner. 

I don’t want a job. I don’t want to leave the country, I don’t want friends, I hate people, I hate everyone and everything. I want peace, and that peace in context for me is just ceasing out of existence, despite me being so so fucking afraid of that idea. But what are the choices? Religion’s definition of heaven? Islam’s definition? Hell? Reincarnation? I’ve already made up my mind more than a decade ago that I didn’t want to be here. I don’t feel like a real person. I was literally born and made just to be dehumanized and to suffer. I don’t want anything, I just want to be gone.

My life is so embarrassing. My entire existence is humiliating and my entire existence I’ve been getting humiliated.

This world is not for me. I was born in the wrong time and in the wrong place. I’m unneeded and don’t want to be here.

I don’t know what else to say since this is my entire lifetime of bottling up absolutely everything inside myself. Just daydreaming all day everyday of venting to imaginary people in imaginary worlds.

I’m tired, sore, sick, bored. And I’m tired of being tired. I want to die as soon as possible. I don’t know what else to say. I am so depressed and lost I don’t know what to do. Especially at the beginning of this year 24/7 the only thing on my mind is death. I think about death to calm myself down. I’m scared. I don’t want to live in this world in any time or place. I don’t know what else to say. I’m tired. I want to die. If I didn’t look at the time I wouldn’t be able to tell whether it’s night or day. This world is not for me. Ever since I was born I’ve never felt a glimpse of happiness. My entire existence, apparently it was never my goal to be remotely happy. I was just born to suffer like that then just die. I’ve never gotten anything I wanted. Everything I’ve ever desired never came true. Ever since I came out the womb I was depressed. Like every day of my life I’ve just spent living waiting for something to happen. I remember being six imagining myself being ten, finally being happy. Then turning ten and imagining myself being 12 and the vicious cycle continues. At least up until leaving islam and getting radicalized. It’s never getting better. Being happy has always been a fantasy to me. I can’t believe there’s people that are living right now, just existing not feeling numb. I am unable to focus on anything other than my own unhappiness. I don’t wanna be me anymore. I’m so sick and tired. 

I’m not going to hell, I’m getting out of it. And if God is real, I’m going from one hell to another. I was made to suffer. I was born as a human to be dehumanized.",t2_kici8yy1,False,,0,False,Im not writing a real suicide note so im posting this here,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tqsjc0,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648531306.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this all weeks ago just writing and rephrasing things, trying to word things right to make sure I get alot off my chest, and I just got the courage to actually post it. I know this is all a mess but I don’t know how to write and just overall express my feelings. Also I know this is all really embarrassing but I don’t know what else to do. I’m sorry for rambling alot, especially in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made an account just with the intention of posting this to &lt;a href=""/r/radicalfeminism""&gt;r/radicalfeminism&lt;/a&gt; but then I realized it might be a little inappropriate so I decided to post this here. I can’t tell you how scared I am of posting this because I know how people are but at this point I couldn’t care less&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also character limit is 40k but the original that I wanted to copy and paste here is more than 70. So I deleted alot of stuff but I posted the full version on instagram because I so badly want to get everything off my chest before killing myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for any mistakes; not a native speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just an introduction, I’m still a teen, arab, live in the middle east, live with my dad and two younger brothers, a closeted ex muslim, bi and a VERY radical feminist (of course closeted too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine myself actually writing one in real life and I bet you 100 percent that my family’s just gonna be upset over the fact that oh I’ve just been so brainwashed by the west and completely forgot Allah and my deen! I don’t know if you know what it’s like to be born in an arab muslim family, in a muslim country, in an islam brainwashed society, but it’s useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just gonna say whatever comes to mind as I’m writing. I’ve had multiple suicide attempts and have been self harming for more than five years now. My entire life I never truly saw myself having a future. At the back of my mind I always kinda knew I wasn’t gonna make it far. I’ve wanted to die ever since I was a toddler. And throughout more than half of my life, the only thing that kept me away from ending it all was the fear of hell. I would have done anything to die and to put myself out of my misery, to just leave my head. It’s like I’m a dead soul in a living body. I feel like a corpse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never worried about future consequences and the thought of eternal doom in the future didn’t matter to me cuz there was no future that I wanted to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been so alone and have never had anybody ever. And after radicalization I realized I actually want no one. It’s so frustrating and irritating, having nobody but your head that you don’t even want, that you despise and want to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own family and parents have absolutely no idea who I am. Both of my parents have always known I wanted to die since I was born but neither know why or care, especially my mom. They actually find it so pathetic and have mocked me so many times. Ever since I came out the womb I’ve wanted to die. And the reasons kept increasing and increasing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it was having to deal with family issues my entire life, then studying and bullying and overall school, then absolutely despising my appearance, then taking off the hijab, then becoming an ex muslim and questioning my entire existence and afterlife, then of course the cherry on top of getting introduced to radical feminism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on top of all that, since I came out of the womb I’ve had major depression. Have been struggling with immense agonizing loneliness and not having any people or friends or family that want me, not online or in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fear of people, my God awful concentration skills, fear of germs, extreme fear of bugs, my face and body, misophonia, and overall physical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I cope, is by daydreaming LITERALLY 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely wonder if I don’t committ suicide if it’s even possible for me to develop more problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in this country is completely led and based on islam. Everyone’s mindset is set on islam, every moral, every everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deafening sound of the adhan everyday reminding me that no matter what I do I’ll always be subordinate to this cult. The way I can’t even find any tampons here cuz they’re viewed as haram. How a man wearing tshirt and shorts is perfectly fine but a woman wearing the same is inappropriate and is &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot;. I can’t relate to anyone here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in this world is either a muslim or a muslim apologist that defends them. Muslim apologists will literally cry a river for whatever problems muslims claim to have. Seeing them defend islam, it’s disgusting. I can’t believe muslims actually believe their own oppressive bullshit. It hurts and it’s so disturbing and heartbreaking seeing muslim women respecting their own chains and even calling it empowering. And the majority have the guts to call islam feminist, it’s so crazy I can’t believe this world real. If people can proudly and openly say they hate pedophilia and that they’re anti racism or anti sexism and homophobia, how come I can’t say I hate islam? I can’t believe the word &amp;quot;islamophobia&amp;quot; is real. Like it’s used against anyone who doesn’t like their disgusting pedophilic, sexist shithole of a religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam is a representation of bigotry, like I can’t believe it. Islam is such a joke, it’s like misogyny and bigotry but make it religion. I can’t believe how people have the audacity to call it non-misogynistic yet alone feminist. Like I don’t get it but at the same time it’s so unsurprising. Out of any religion, of course it’s gonna be the most misogynistic one that everyone chooses to defend to the moon and back and call people bigots for hating it. I can’t put it into words how much I hate everything and to what degree I want to just disappear. I want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get it, why men would be muslim. Women are muslim out of fear, whether they’re aware of it or not, but with men, they’re granted their little adolescent, eternal virgin sex slaves in Jannah and in every fucking aspect of islam men are seen and treated as superior. All the privileges they have. Allah loves men. Maybe except the homosexual man, because you know the kind of man that would degrade himself so much to lower himself down to a woman’s level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in my life collapsed in my really short journey of becoming what muslim apologists would call an “islamophobe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want this world or any religions idea of what Jannah/heaven is. I hate everything and everyone. I just feel so alone. I literally have nobody. And if God is real, I hate him, what a sadistic, woman-hating, male supremacist, male-gendered god, that everyone refers to as he/him. Because you know, men are the default and women are abnormal subhumans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world is such a joke, like there’s no way everyone is just so ok with bigotry. I don’t feel human anymore. Like not only have I never been treated as one, but I’m not even an adult yet and I’ve already set my morals. So how come others haven’t realized the so insanely oppressive world that they live in? Oh wait nobody actually cares. I can’t believe that I’m actually a living person, I feel so subhuman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from depression, I’ve never went to get anything diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this constant headache that I’ve had for as long as I can remember that just can’t seem to go away. No matter how much I’ve slept I never feel well rested. And I just overall feel chronic pain all around my body. Always feeling fatigued and tired. Just so uncomfortable all the time, that’s what my normal is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a giant fear of people and I absolutely dread interacting with them, doesn’t matter who the person is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I try so hard to get people to just not hate me, to treat me okay, but no matter what I do it never works. It doesn’t matter who it is. It makes me believe that that’s just who I am and it’s inevitable for me to not be treated this way. It doesn’t matter if it’s online or in real life. I don’t understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one’s ever cared about me the way I do for them. It really hurts it’s so painful. I don’t know why I’m always treated like fucking subhuman garbage. I want to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t make myself focus or concentrate no matter how hard I try. I try so hard to the point it physically hurts. I could literally read three pages of something then snap out of it and have no idea what I just read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so fucking frustrating not knowing what’s wrong with me. I just constantly feel irritated, physically and emotionally. Everything is so hard. It’s so exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so much struggle with nightmares and sleeping. And it doesn’t matter whether I sleep two hours or fifteen hours, I feel so tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a daydreamer and all I do 24/7 is pretend I’m living in a different world. I don’t remember a time in my life where I wasn’t doing it literally all day. It is alllll I have done my entire life. An example, while I’ve been writing this entire thing I’m just imagining a different me, in a different universe talking about all of this to imaginary people, and venting to them and having them relate to me and understand me. And I do this all the time, just venting to imaginary people. It’s my way of escaping. I feel so stupid. So many times a day I get up from bed just to pace around my room imagining universes where bigotry doesn’t exist. Where I’m a different person and I look and sound beautiful, a universe where I look and sound like what I actually wish I did. Like with the times (honestly like 70% of the time) that I’m imagining that I still live in this world, except the majority of people are accepting of rad feminism and like 50% percent of women are already peaked. But it’s all in my head and none of it is/will ever be real unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, without a doubt, spent more of my life daydreaming than I have living in reality. It’s basically my substitute to living. It’s the only thing I have control over. I get to decide how the world is, what I look like, sound like, how others are, how I’m treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then reality hits me and I realize that isn’t actually how the world is, I’m not actually that person, her face and body aren’t mine, the people aren’t my friends or family, they aren’t real people who love me and care for me, that world isn’t real and real people aren’t like that. It feels like my mind is ruining itself. But as always, all I have to do is ignore this and daydream again and it all resets and continues, the cycle of escaping my agonizing reality, living in a comfortable world, and just daydream for 95% of the day everyday. And my life just becomes more and more unbearable. Just completely out of touch with reality. I’m living in my head that’s what it is. It’s the only thing stable in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just listening to sad songs or certain type of music, or the usual songs I listen to, make me feel so fucking depressed and just make me wanna crawl out of my skin I hate it so much. Like it just sends this wave of agonizing depression reminding me of how sad I actually am. It’s just this intense sadness and emptiness that won’t go away. That’s all I feel, either overwhelming sadness or overwhelming numbness. I want to die. I’m not afriad of death, but I am so scared of the actual process of dying. I wish it was as easy as pressing a button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get frustrated really easily and it always leads me to crying. I can’t control or manage my emotions. And it feels like every emotion I feel, I feel it a hundred times more intensely than other people. Little things that other people usually just brush off, send me into emotional tailspins that last forever. I just feel empty and numb. I really don’t feel like a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a very disliked person, I’ve just never been liked. I personally don’t believe in stuff like energy, but I seriously don’t know why ever since I was a fucking toddler nobody ever wanted me. No family, friends, not online, not anywhere. I’ve never ever had anyone or anyone to talk to. I’ve just been bottling up everything and suffering without fucking anybody even knowing a glimpse of what I’m going through. I tried when I was really young, like really young. I used to threaten suicide and would repeatedly say I wanted to die. Absolutely nobody cared. I was just a little drama queen to everyone, and that’s how I’m still viewed. No one could care any less. I don’t understand what it is. If it’s not energy or whatever then what is it? I know it’s partially my looks and voice but then what about online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get zero messages and have absolutely nobody to talk to. No one but myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even in the hypothetical chance I had the ability to make a friend, the only time I can actually see myself having a friend and liking them, is if they’re well versed in radfem theory. And I can’t peak anyone, like what am I gonna do, give them an obligatory reading list? And I think it goes without saying that even then, this would only be the case online. Cuz it’s not like I have any options, plus I wouldn’t want anyone in real life anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing about me I don’t despise. I hate my body and overall appearance. From head to toe I wish I looked different. I hate my appearance so much words can’t describe it. My face, my skin color, hair, body hair, voice, scars, skin. I wish I had my ideal face and body. I wish I had a way different voice. My feminism just thrown out the window when it comes to all this, I know. But I just can’t help but fucking hate everything about myself. I wish I had plain white skin, different nose, different voice, smaller and different eyes, silky straight hair, wider different mouth, different cheekbones, different brows, smaller different boobs, different jaw, different forehead, less chubby cheeks, different legs, different feet, different torso, no scars, taller height, flawless skin. My face and body are the embodiment of everything I hate. I would replace everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many embarrassing things about my appearance that I’m not gonna mention bcuz I’m too ashamed and embarrassed. Even if this is online. Having others that thankfully don’t know what I look like, get an idea of it, isn’t something I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t play more than 90 percent of the games I used to play or watch the shows or anime or anything anymore cuz the second I see misogyny or bigotry I get so pissed and couldn’t care less if misogyny aside, the thing I was watching or playing was good. And this applies to music too. I am so fucking devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you guys do it? I’ve only just got introduced to radical feminism and got radicalized not even two years ago, and I’m already so so sooo fucking done with this woman-hating garbage world. Maybe it’s because I’m already a broken human and have been all my life but I just genuinely cannot fathom this world. Like how? I’m still a teen and am so confused as to how I wasn’t radicalized wayyyy sooner. I can’t fathom how for thousands and thousands of years this is how things have been, and are only getting way worse. How are there not riots full of angry women all around the world? How is not EVERYONE radical?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexism is the oldest form of oppression and for thousands of years it still remains the worst form. And nothing is being done about it, it’s only getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can gender still be a thing? And how do people defend it? How is islam a real religion that has existed for more than a thousand years, has more than one billion followers and has the entire world defend and adore it? How is kink a thing? And how do people defend it and not find it so fucking absurd and just absolutely disgusting and not throw up in the mouth thinking about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with things like gender I understand needing a little bit of learning to understand why it’s terrible and needs to be abolished, but with other things, the misogyny is so blatantly obvious it’s painful!! It’s right there!! How do you not see???How does it not completely and utterly disgust you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no place in this world. Anyone that even dares to think about anything &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; about all the things you SHOULD hate, that you SHOULD despise, if you hate it, you’re a bigot. It’s like irony at its finest. There are fucking labels that were created on top of all of this. Jesus christ the irony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hate islam? Islamophobe. You’re rightfully angry at men? Misandrist. You hate gender? Terf. You hate kink? Kinkshamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, as if these are negative things!! This is how everyone should be. This is basic human fucking decency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh these words. These fucking words that they created to use against anyone who doesn’t accept their blatantly misogynistic, pedophilic, bigoted disgusting pile of oppressive bullshit ideologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are zero words in the entire english vernacular to describe how much I fucking hate these ideologies and anyone who defends them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shitty world where women are viewed and treated as subhuman made to please men. How everyone is treating men as animals and women like their caretakers but view it as if it were the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that men can openly admit to getting aroused off of women’s abuse and oppression, that it gives them pleasure, and people are more than accepting about it. It it so disturbing. Men find our abuse arousing. Jesus christ. The way it’s viewed as moral and even &amp;quot;empowering&amp;quot; for a woman to be verbally and physically degraded, slapped, strangled, hit, spat on, just dehumanized, completely stripped of her humanity for the sake of &amp;quot;kink&amp;quot;. How men can get their hatred out on us, excuse their misogyny, pedophilia, racism, beastiality, whatever it is, it’s all just justified for the sake of a man’s pleasure. And when men spread their porn-poisoned minds to women and children, suddenly it’s excused as &amp;quot;kink&amp;quot; and that it’s natural. Men regularly consuming hours after hours of women being dehumanized and degraded, getting aroused off of it. We are worthless in their eyes, our abuse is entertainment to them. But yknow, didn’t the woman consent? Did she not choose to be dehumanized? Did she not say yes? Is it not between two consenting adults? Is there not a safeword? Is there not aftercare? This is traumatizing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions, hell probably billions, of men finding pleasure in any woman’s pain, and society as a whole sees nothing wrong with that? None of this seems real to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so aware of everything that I see and hear, it’s insufferable. Like all the misogyny I hear and see feel like direct attacks to me. Like it all hits one million times harder. I can’t even listen to music anymore. The sexist slurs and the hinting at sadomasochism/kink constantly getting traumatized and reminded of how sick everyone (men) is. And just the way men talk about women and even the way women talk about themselves. Like I can’t listen to a song and enjoy it for what it is cuz the creator identifies with or defends TRAs, or has wrote a sexist song/lyrics. It’s so fucking stupid. I can’t watch any anime or play most games anymore or even fucking talk to people who like it cuz there’s these two things that once I noticed I couldn’t ever unsee it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been bottling up all my feelings and pain inside myself since I came out the womb. I don’t have and have never had anybody, not online, not in real life, not anywhere. I’ve just been lonely and alone my entire life. Nobody to talk to and share my depression with. And I don’t want anyone now. I hate everyone and everything. I’m dealing with stuff I can’t even find others dealing with. After radicalization, I see misogyny and bigotry in everything, like everything. Even things I used to enjoy. Anime, games, music, etc. Whatever it is, you name it. I can’t enjoy anything. Like imagine someone telling you all anime, games and cartoons are bigoted. You’ll think they’re deranged. I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After radicalization I threw away anything that &amp;quot;triggered&amp;quot; me. All my posters, figurines, consoles, pc and of course the games within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only &amp;quot;hobbies&amp;quot; I had, the amount of money and time spent on them, just all in the trash. I used to literally own thousands of dollars worth of figurines alone, so it hurt to know all that money could’ve been saved if I just hadn’t been a degenerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning of the year I threw away all of my stuff, so I can’t even play the games I used to spend 90% of day playing. So I have absolutely nothing to do. Along with throwing away everything, I have nothing on my phone. A couple of months ago I deleted basically everything off my phone, my entire camera roll and all the notes I had. Full of my passwords and the majority was just a very, very, long suicide message I was gonna send to both my parents. Like 30 notes that I spent like six months writing until I realized it literally does not fucking matter. Before, my entire camera roll was literally only just pictures of women and girls with looks I envied. Daydream about having them. I would rather be anyone else. I hate myself so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entire life I had never truly saw myself having a future. Cutting myself carelessly wishing I would accidentally cut an artery. Went from hoarding to throwing away things and memories I once coveted. Throwing away all the furniture in my room aside from bed, bedside table and mirror. Quitting school in highschool after all the years of hard work and depression of being forced to go and study. Never caring about my health whether mental or physical. Daydreaming 24/7 never considering reality unless I had to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since hating my looks, absolutely despising it, I thought I had REALLY lost all hope, cuz no amount of surgery will I ever make me look like the ideal woman I want to look like. (And you know, at the back of mind I’ve always hated my looks, it was just the realizing it part.) But then becoming an ex Muslim and questioning the afterlife and getting into rad feminism was when I actually knew it really can’t get worse. Becoming aware of misogyny and bigotry hurts so much. Like nothing bothers me more than casual misogyny. I can’t live normally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I genuinely feel more upset and angry at women than I do at men. We have absolutely no class solidarity. Handmaidens everywhere. Religious women, liberal women, TIFs. That’s like more than 99 percent of the female population. Women are spending their entire lives fighting for male acceptance. Why is no one willing to do something? I know this whole thing isn’t our fault, it’s not remotely our fault, but if these women actually fucking cared about themselves and other women, they’d do something about it. Instead they put down other women and would do basically ANYTHING to defend and justify female oppression. Literally worshipping male supremacy and patriarchy. There is no hope. I’m just so tired. We aren’t viewed as human beings deserving of empathy and dignity. True liberation does not even seem fathomable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way men are hiding their hatred of women behind this thin veil called &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;preference&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kink&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How when men are oppressed, it’s tragedy. But when women are oppressed, it’s religion, culture, tradition, biology, sex, preference, a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I discovered radical feminism everything went downhill in a way I never thought it could. Obviously not in the sense that I regret getting into it, it’s just the realization of the world we live in. It is built by men, for men, from top to bottom. Women don’t and cannot benefit from it in any way shape or form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see misogyny in your father, mother, relatives, school/work, stores, music, games, shows, books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know it sounds stupid but to just think about all the women that had to give up their dreams and aspirations just to become the kind of woman patriarchy told them to be. My heart aches beyond belief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel really out of touch with reality. I don’t have a sense of self. It feels I’ve switched from being one person to another. Like the way my morals and values completely changed. Like to me I consider my radicalization both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because holy shit it felt like I’ve opened my third eye. Going from a severely misogynistic Muslim conservative who defended pedophilia and racism, to someone who literally cries wishing hell existed so I could rest assured people who are like who I used to be all burn in it. And it’s a curse because, just like what Dworkin said, it’s an agony to be fully and intimately conscious of all the brutal misogyny that’s quite literally ingrained in every single part of the world. There is no escape from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of getting radicalized and realizing just how crooked this world is, I found myself googling stuff like &amp;quot;radfem suicide&amp;quot; just to see, who else? Because I cannot imagine not getting severally depressed being so conscious of misogyny, especially as a woman. But of course all that came up when I searched stuff like that were very triggering (cuz all are to me) anti radfem posts and articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like wherever you go, racism here, colorism there, kink this porn that, religion this gender that. And liberal feminism rhetoric everywhere. It just doesn’t go away. Nowhere. This world has no place for liberated women. I open my phone, and BOOM a reference to kink, a misogynistic slur here and there, video with a misogynistic song playing in the background, trans or muslim &amp;quot;representation&amp;quot;. Heck even someone saying LGBT/LGBTQ instead of just LGB triggers me. And again, liberal feminist rhetoric quite literally everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical thinking skills and logic are seen as bigotry. I want to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every minute my day gets worse. Just reading femicide news and looking at statistics. Jfc the amount of women getting raped and killed. I don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do about any of this? Go to a therapist? No person is gonna help me with this. They’ll think I’m a crazy bigot. And even if in the hypothetical chance I leave the country, and it was another woman who felt the same way I did, what’s she gonna do? Telling her I don’t like the amount of women getting raped. I don’t like the amount of women getting killed. I don’t like how women’s abuse is considered sexy. I don’t like how pedophilia and bigotry are considered sexy. I don’t like the amount of religions just based on controlling women. I don’t like gender. I don’t like that women are viewed and treated as subhuman. I don’t like that women are pressured and made to feel the need to shave every inch of their bodies. I don’t like that women are breaking their faces and mutilating their bodies all for the sake of male acceptance. I don’t like that women are pressured and made to feel the need to coat their entire faces in liquids and powders just for male approval. I don’t like that women are considered either private or public property. I don’t like that women are seen as objects to be used. And most importantly, I hate that 99.99 percent of women aren’t aware of this or just simply don’t care. This world DESPISES radfems. Like everything I stand by and believe in, people see it as full on bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world is so fucking rotten and wicked. Just garbage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate being a woman, or specifically the consequences that come with it. I cut my hair that used to be hips length, wear clothing twice my size, let my bangs and hair cover as much of face as possible, just avoiding anything stereotypically &amp;quot;girly&amp;quot;. Just anything to hide that I’m female. Anything to avoid male eyes on me thinking the worst of me. But hopefully after I die, by islams definition of the end of the world on judgment day, I’m gonna have to make myself be forgiven for being female. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I envy men so much. I’m so so jealous of their freedom. But at the same time I don’t wish that I was a man. It’s so sick, I can’t ever imagine being a man and being ok with all these privileges that I have. I don’t know how men do it. How much men hate women, it is incomprehensible. The only thing worse is the betrayal of some women. Women really have no idea how much men hate us. I’m devastated. I couldn’t dehumanize men if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of getting radicalized, I was so angry at men that I genuinely, truly tried to disregard them. Individually and as a whole. Disregard their opinions, the stuff they had to say and what they thought. Just tried to completely strip them of their humanity. Consciously making the decision to try and dehumanize and objectify them. But I failed every single time. I felt so utterly disgusted and revolted by myself. I could not help but feel empathy for them and value their dignity. I really don’t know how men do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to dehumanize someone like that, to objectify a living being. It is so difficult for me to comprehend this level of apathy and degeneracy. I assume that’s because I’m a woman and I have the ability to genuinely care, love and feel empathy for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that you can bring the most radical, the most man-hating woman that there is and her hatred for men will still not equate to the average mans hatred for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll never be free. Humanity will die with women being more oppressed than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I lacked critical thinking skills. Everyone seems so ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t understand the amount of despair, hopelessness and depression I have in me. How so sad I get getting reminded that today isn’t my last day alive. I don’t want to wake up it’s scary. I cry over the thought of &amp;quot;tomorrow&amp;quot;. I want to die. I want to disappear. I just want peace, I want to die. I hate everyone and everything so much. I want to die. Everyday is so fucking exhausting. I am so fucking tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I’ll regret saying any of this since I always come out of any vent somehow more hopeless than before. In which my &amp;quot;vents&amp;quot; in context are literally like a one in a year message to my dad saying &amp;quot;I want to die&amp;quot; or a long ass paragraph that he probably doesn’t even bother reading, and him leaving me on read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow everyday I get more and more hopeless and filled with despair. I don’t think anyone understands even a little bit of how much I want to so desperately cease out of existence. I’m so so lonely and alone. I’ve been like this since I was a toddler. Things only just got worse and worse. And since I’m not underweight and don’t cut everyday, it doesn’t matter. If I don’t look as sick as I feel then it doesn’t matter right? Even though someone could literally slice my leg off and burn my eyes, and that physical pain would still not equate to 0.1 percent of the mental pain I’m in. Everyday is pure agony, every second, every minute, every hour. I always feel like crying but nothing comes out of my eyes. I can’t describe how I feel. I can’t explain it verbally or in any way really. I can’t tell you the amount of pain I’m in, just the pain I get of reminding myself today isn’t the last day I’m alive and that I’ll wake up tomorrow. This thought is always on my mind, I just try to ignore it or else I’ll just shed a few tears and go back to trying to put that thought aside again by daydreaming about happiness and/or sadness that’ll lead to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I can’t do that and that wave of depression is so strong that I can’t ignore it. It doesn’t matter what bullshit I try and distract myself with, that pit in my stomach just doesn’t go away. And the most frustrating part is that I think I’ve reached a point where it’s really hard for me to relieve myself from crying. I cry so easily over the simplest stuff, my entire life that’s been the case. But no amount of tears and pain and sleep can relieve even little bit of my suffering. In the times that I break down I only physically cry a little before trying to force myself to stop and try to numb away whatever I’m feeling. Cutting myself until there’s yellow fat bubbling out, until I get gaping cuts, until there’s so much clotting I can’t fit anymore, digging my nails into my scalp until there’s blood on my fingertips, scratching at my skin until it gets sticky, squeezing my flesh so hard it bruises, screaming into the pillow until my throat feels like sandpaper and my head feels like it’s about to explode. Until my entire body, inside and out, is aching with pain. Doing anything to feel anything. Just trying to relieve myself of this constant agonizing numbness. Just trying anything to fill the void in me but nothing ever works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather be anyone else. Whoever is reading this, I envy you and your life so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so helpless. It’s so scary I hate it so much. I feel so hopeless. I want to die, I want to disappear. Everything is so exhausting. I am so bored of life. I want to die. The times in my life of hearing my dad or anyone say stuff like &amp;quot;the future&amp;quot; and talking and insinuating that I’ll still be alive by then. It makes me feel so lonely and misunderstood. Even if &amp;quot;the future&amp;quot; in context is just couple of days, weeks or, God forbid, years or months. The idea of still being alive just breaks me. I don’t have any thoughts or plans for the future. It makes me so mad it’s so irritating and frustrating, it’s indescribable. I hate everyone and everything. I’m so numb to everything. I’d do anything to feel anything. I don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t want to be me anymore. I want to die. I want to disappear, to cease out of existence. I want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like I’m telling you I want to disappear but at the same time it’s scary. Like seriously? I was just born to suffer like that? Put into a brutally woman-hating disgustingly bigoted world, be put in agony for the entirety of my existence, then die without a single soul knowing why or caring? I just I don’t know. I can’t tell you how much my heart hurts thinking that I’ll disappear after death. But at the same time, if there’s no other option than religion’s view of afterlife then I’ll gladly disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tolerate uncertainty and I seriously cannot force myself to believe in any kind of heaven. I just believe that after death it’ll be like before you were born, just nothingness. And &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; that, or rather just believing in that, makes me so intensely sad. Any adjective I could use right now to describe how I feel would be really underestimating how sad and upset I really am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hatred for my appearance is so much, that if hypothetically God existed, if I were to go to my ideal Heaven, no misogyny, no pedophilia, no colorism, racism or bigotry, eternal happiness for all, kind of heaven, if my looks &amp;amp; voice don’t change to the way I want them now, I wouldn’t want that heaven, I would rather disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my god am I a hypocrite. If another woman was saying this I would one thousand percent not agree with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I’ve ever talked about any of this. Only times I’ve &amp;quot;talked&amp;quot; about this is literally all day everyday in my head talking to imaginary people in imaginary worlds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even call myself a burden because I make no difference in anyone’s life. Dead or alive, wouldn’t make a difference. I’m just this thing that breathes and sleeps living in the background of my dad’s life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was muslim I used to try and make myself feel better by saying that I’ll get justice on the day of judgement. That every person that has ever wronged me, Allah would tell them how much they’ve wronged me. But to know that I’ve lived to suffer and just die like that makes my heart ache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide before becoming a legal adult is inevitable to me. I have no plans for living after that. And I’m really contemplating doing it before eid this year. Ramadan is starting in really early April and I can’t imagine how hard fasting and pretending to still be Muslim is gonna be. And I’m not even talking about the fasting part, it’s just the constant reminder that I’m doing it for this insanely misogynistic &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;, and having my dad/family think I’m doing it cuz I’m Muslim. Being surrounded by muslim apologists everywhere is so painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only plan really is to just not drink water and maybe even no food until I just die without even knowing it. Which apparently takes less than a week. I’ve already went multiple days in the past without water and/or food so I’m really not anticipating THE worst. It’s just a matter of when to me. Inshallah after all my failures of a suicide, I can guarantee death this time. I can’t believe after all my life I had had this &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; it’s all just gone down the drain in my very short journey of becoming an ex muslim and getting introduced to radfeminism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a broken record with the amount of times I’ve just spent daydreaming about venting about my problems, which is like 80 percent of my daydreaming fantasies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always either overwhelming numbness or sadness. And the feeling is so intense it’s unbearable. It’s beyond my control. And nothing is relieving me from any of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times when I was muslim it didn’t really matter whether I was crying, breaking down, on the verge of suicide, I’d always tell myself I’m gonna die and go to Jannah. Jannah was my only motivation for living. Since anything is possible there, it was basically the only thing I would think about. I can’t tell you the amount of euphoria and plain happiness that I used to feel &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; that my daydreams right now, in dunya, will become a reality in Jannah. Like depressed as hell just daydreaming about how all this will become a reality one day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how fucking badly I wish my ideal heaven was real. There’s no words to express how devastated I am. Just completely broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday I get filled with regret for not ending it sooner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want a job. I don’t want to leave the country, I don’t want friends, I hate people, I hate everyone and everything. I want peace, and that peace in context for me is just ceasing out of existence, despite me being so so fucking afraid of that idea. But what are the choices? Religion’s definition of heaven? Islam’s definition? Hell? Reincarnation? I’ve already made up my mind more than a decade ago that I didn’t want to be here. I don’t feel like a real person. I was literally born and made just to be dehumanized and to suffer. I don’t want anything, I just want to be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is so embarrassing. My entire existence is humiliating and my entire existence I’ve been getting humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world is not for me. I was born in the wrong time and in the wrong place. I’m unneeded and don’t want to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what else to say since this is my entire lifetime of bottling up absolutely everything inside myself. Just daydreaming all day everyday of venting to imaginary people in imaginary worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired, sore, sick, bored. And I’m tired of being tired. I want to die as soon as possible. I don’t know what else to say. I am so depressed and lost I don’t know what to do. Especially at the beginning of this year 24/7 the only thing on my mind is death. I think about death to calm myself down. I’m scared. I don’t want to live in this world in any time or place. I don’t know what else to say. I’m tired. I want to die. If I didn’t look at the time I wouldn’t be able to tell whether it’s night or day. This world is not for me. Ever since I was born I’ve never felt a glimpse of happiness. My entire existence, apparently it was never my goal to be remotely happy. I was just born to suffer like that then just die. I’ve never gotten anything I wanted. Everything I’ve ever desired never came true. Ever since I came out the womb I was depressed. Like every day of my life I’ve just spent living waiting for something to happen. I remember being six imagining myself being ten, finally being happy. Then turning ten and imagining myself being 12 and the vicious cycle continues. At least up until leaving islam and getting radicalized. It’s never getting better. Being happy has always been a fantasy to me. I can’t believe there’s people that are living right now, just existing not feeling numb. I am unable to focus on anything other than my own unhappiness. I don’t wanna be me anymore. I’m so sick and tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to hell, I’m getting out of it. And if God is real, I’m going from one hell to another. I was made to suffer. I was born as a human to be dehumanized.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m just stuck…I have nothing to look forward too. I have a beautiful girlfriend who I’ve been with for almost 6 years now, but about a year ago I found out she fucked her boss and her bosses boyfriend. I knew for awhile but couldn’t prove it. I even started cutting myself because I couldn’t deal with it and it didn’t bother her at all. She just kept cheating on me until I found proof. Worst part is I don’t even mind doing stuff with people who aren’t just me and her, I’m very open sexually. But I’m not good enough to be involved! Nobody invites the socially awkward boyfriend of the hot girl hahaha

Afterwards I tried to be accommodating and had us both be more open sexually, but that just led to her talking to several other guys behind my back, talking to them like they were her soul mates, telling them things she’s never told me. It’s like, damn, why do all this? You give somebody as much space to figure out what they want as you can, and  they still keep things from you. I don’t even care that she liked other people really….it’s all the hiding and the intimacy. Our entire relationship she acted like I was the only person who she could ever be attracted to, acted suspicious anytime I’d talk to another girl, removed the girls from my phone that weren’t her…..it’s a bit much but I thought that’s just what happens when somebody loves you a lot. But it’s all projection I guess.

Now here we are over a year later. We have a lot of good times. I love her and love everything we do. But there is ALWAYS a voice in my head telling me what a joke I am and how she’ll cheat on me again as soon as she gets the chance. I have no confidence in myself. I feel dumb even having sex because it’s like, she’s actually done all her fantasies and I’m just the guy who wishes I could have been there with her. I wouldn’t even think of trying to explore my own fantasies, I feel ridiculous.  I’m a nervous man who would need her to guide me through them and make me comfortable, but she has no need for me to explore herself.

I don’t know what the point of this is even…..just don’t know what to do. We live together. Neither of us could afford our own place. I wouldn’t want to live without her anyways. I left home for an hour last night and it’s like my soul was crushed. Nothing mattered to me. When I’m with her, all I see is how she hurt me. When im not with her I feel like a shell of a person. It’s just too much….I wish I didn’t have parents who cared because I’d rather just blow my brains out then deal with all of this. I hate that people would mourn me. Ugh.

I just kind of fuly thought about this that maybe i dont *really* want to commit suicide. I have had bad days where i wanted to do it even made suicide notes tied the rope, etc.But most of the days where i think about committing suicide (which is i guess also most of the days) is me just... wanting to escape a problem or predicament im currently going through, like a mentality of ""man i wish i could end all of it right now"". Because most of the days where i think about suicide, if i fully commit to that thought, like actually being serious about it...i kinda get scared, scared of the pain of the method of choice, what comes after for me,what comes after for everyone around me etc.

So looking back when i sometimes search up ""painless suicide method"" or ""ways to kill yourself"", i dont feel that im feeling genuine about wanting to actually kill myself, i just want to use it to escape from anything im currently feeling right now like ""hey if it got too bad, i can always kill myself with this suicide method i know"" or how me thinking a way out from a big problem is just to kill myself, which i dont really from the bottom of my heart, i want to do.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been with my boyfriend for 7 years. I met him at a time I was at one of my lowest, and seriously contemplating ending my life. It felt like he saved me, even though I was apprehensive at first, as I've been betrayed by just about everyone in my life in some shape and form before him. I thought I had finally found someone who truly loved me and wouldn't betray me. I also discover I was wrong all these years later.

I've recently been kind of suspicious of his behaviour, he'll go into the bathroom and spend much longer in there than expected. He's not showering/bathing, and not taking a dump either, he finally admitted to watching porn after constant prodding and me walking in on him once. That hurts, knowing he's more interested in other women than someone who is physically with him. I haven't watched porn myself in years, because I find it disrespectful to do so in a relationship, and because I have no desire to.

This created an argument between us. I've lost so much trust in him, it's not just the porn, he's kept so many secrets from me and flat out lied to me so many times that I don't feel like I can trust him with anything any more. I didn't think it would be something I ever wanted to do, but I asked to see his phone, because it felt like the last shred of hope I had that I could at least still trust him not to cheat, to not betray our relationship entirely.

He refused, even while I was having a panic attack, even while I was crying for hours. I felt like my last attempt for some reassurance was denied. I've relapsed into self harming after being clean for nearly a decade. This is apparently still preferable to me seeing his phone. I feel like I am literally worth less than plastic to the person most important in my life.

I know that even if I saw it at this point, he's likely deleted anything incriminating. His reluctance to not show me any under condition has only cemented in my mind that he likely is cheating.

I just wish I knew where I went wrong. Was I not attractive/desirable enough? Was I not what he wanted despite constantly telling me I was? Was there something I did?

I'll never know, because he'll never tell me. And even if he did, he's never honest with me, he just tells me what he thinks I want to hear.

How the hell am I supposed to reconcile the fact I am worth less than a phone to someone who meant the world to me? I didn't know it was possible to feel this distraught and heartbroken. I don't really have anything else to live for at this point. I know people may say it's not worth taking my life over someone else, but it's not just about him, I've been suicidal most of my life, he was just my lifeboat, and now I've lost that.

I was born an unwanted child, the result of an affair. I was kept at home and not allowed to go to school. I was abused by my mother physically and emotionally my whole life. I had very few friends, and the ones I did ended up betraying my trust in some way eventually. I felt like I had no one, and now I know I truly don't. I wish I just never had the desire to have connections with other people.

I have nothing else to lose any more. I just hope I can find some method where I am sure to die, because I can't take any more pain, physical or mental at this point. Knowing I could screw up and be left crippled/disabled scares me, but that's the only thing holding me back from ending my life now.",,False,,0,False,I am worth less than plastic to the person most important to me,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tqzg2n,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,,False,,,{},,True,,1648559543.0,text,0,,,,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years.

Try going months without a single conversation with anyone.
I used to deactivate My facebook around my birthday so id feel less of a loser. I often see people post happy birthday in eachothers wall. Not mine though. Why do i gotta be suck a fuck up. 

Making friends for me is impossible, I cant talk in online games becausemy voice is laughed at then i get muted.
""It cant be that bad"". Youd be wrong. 

Ive tried killing myself a few years ago by overdose. That night and the following day none of my family memebers came to check up on me. I had nobody that day.

I recently lost both my best friend and brother to suicide.

Im a virgin at 27 and often get harrassed about it.

I was molested by a foster brother when i was little, maybe thats why im so goddamn awkward. Ive told one person and was told to 'man up thats in the past'

I often wish i was born the opposite gender because then maybe people would listen to me when i try telling.

And tonight, I live with my mom and brothers. We live on a reservation and the constant drinking has me wondering if this is all we have to look forward to. My niece is down to visit and my mother is still getting blaxkout drunk. If her Granddaughter isnt enough for her to stop drinking for a bit. The fuck is the point!

""Why dont you move out"" i have no work experience and the basic task of talking to people nearly breaks me down. 

I attribute all my social anxiety to being forced to pleassure another man. I to this day still think about it.

My family doesnt talk about emotional issues. When my best friend died nobody comforted me. When my brother died grief counselors avoided me like the plague. 

Im basically unapproachable. Even paid professionals didnt want to talk to me. 

Im not gonna do it tonight, Im going to wait for my brother to take my niece home (they live about 6 hours away). 

Hanging seems like the way to go. Im thinking a rope with a sock on the sides so they compress my juggular veins to make me black out fast. 

If i cant find a rope, death by cops is another option.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I am a 25 years old man.

For short, i want to end my life because it's already too much for me.

To summarize a little.

Form the moment my brain can sustain some memories, i only remember fights, beatings and hate in family.
My father is an alcoholic, my mother is literally crazy.

I struggled for years too look happy in front of everyone.
At one moment i highschool i started to stay a lot on Skype and make friends on the internet while i tried to live a normal real life ( not the behind the monitor life, screw that).

At 18, I moved alone, i said it would be good to finish university in another city so I moved from my hometown to Bucharest, in hope that my life would change and i will have a little more than now, make some friends that i can spend time with, forget about the family and maybe found someone for me.

7 years later, i have finished university ( and master) and have one of the best job a fresh engineer can get. Trouble in my family have not changed at all, i lost all my friends either by them disappearing for my life or cutting me from theirs, my family say that i didn't accomplish anything and all i have it's because of their work and the money they gave me. And I have one true friend left

Come back to present, almost half a year after those seven, with the family nothing has changed, they just have a little more money, they are happy about it but that's all. The only friend i had it was a girl, from university, it was a little something between us but we agreed to remain friends, until two days ago.

To explain why this friend is bothering, because for my family and all my good friends i gave them all i have.
Everytime she looked like she had problems or i know she had i will ask her and try to make her happy or even going to her home, when she had a serious operation i checked everyday ( even if i was in another country).

Then in one week i just send her some memes and news and one week nothing ( that is because in that week i spoke with absolutely no one) and she did not say almost anything in those two weeks. After those two weeks we meet, she goes home and send me some messages, some of them to he like: "" i am happy that i have seen you, as you don't care about me, but i do"".
This felt like a knife in the back.

So, this are just some of all the bad things in this shi**y life for almost 25 years.

I thought about ending my life before, but i hoped some things will get better and i really tried, worked for a better future, still nothing works.

Tomorrow i am traveling to Croația for work and coming in some weeks, i will message my friend to meet and say goodbye and then, ending my life or continue suffer because I don't know anymore what to do.

It’s always in the back my mind. I do struggle with my depression and my borderline. And the last few years have been the worst especially the last 10 or 11 months. 

I began a relationship with someone who I care about and feel deeply for more so than anyone I have in my life.

My jealous and abusive tendencies Have been on full blast and  have done irreparable damage to our relationship. 
Emotional abuse. Physical abuse. Crossing boundaries constantly. 

Aside from this my life is slowly falling apart as my mental state gets worse. I’ve been basically unemployed for the last month due to an injury that has required surgery. This has given me even more time to dwell in my feelings and stress out my partner. As well as experiencing some serious financial struggle.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone.  So I'm starting my undergraduate thesis within my Data Science degree.  I always figured I would do my Master's Thesis on the subject of suicide, but I'm going to go into an MBA program so here we are.  My point to that little story is it's the reason I've been reading through all these posts.  I won't bore you with the tech stuff, it's not important.

So the thoughts from no one... 

As I've parsed through the posts and comments I am heartbroken.  On so many levels. To each and every one of you.. my heart goes out to you and your pain.  I'm not going to give you the cliches that everyone is so used to hearing.  But what I will tell you is I've been here.  I may not know exactly what you are going through but I know what it feels like to want to die.  Perhaps I even know what its like to die.  The jury is still out on the Near Death Experience thing.  I'm not sure between the whole heaven thing or the elaborate hallucination your brain is going through trying to protect itself theory.  That is a completely different story for a completely different day.

So okay maybe just a tiny cliche.  But I'm going to argue it's not actually a cliche if I've been down this road.  Right?  I think that's fair...

It gets better.  I promise.  It will get bad again.  And then good again.  And bad, and good.  So on over and over.  It may get great sometimes.  You may end up thinking to yourself I'm never going to feel like that again only to find yourself right back there.  But still.. it gets better. 

The best part about life is you get to decide your path.  You get to make decisions and make changes.  Maybe you're a minor and think you can't.. but set goals.  Work YOUR ASS OFF doing whatever (school, part time job, etc) and BE SOMETHING GREAT. Time goes by so incredibly fast and before you know it you aren't a minor anymore and you can leave your dysfunction behind with all that $$ you saved being kick ass. 

It's just one small scenario but it can be modified and fit to almost anything.  YOU get to decide how you feel today.  And from someone who can honestly say I don't remember any of the shit I was so sure I should end my life over 10+ years ago.  Not one bit.  I can't say I never think about these days, and certainly some things have happened that were completely devastating to where I didn't see a way out at all.  But as I've grown into a young adult, and then a not so young adult.. I've gotten better at dealing with it.  It still hurts, but I know it gets better.  Because I saw it get better after 17 and 20 and 23. Everything in life has made me stronger.  Independent.  I have an attitude and outlook where I do me and it doesn't fit the norm 99.9 % of the time, but I own it. And I'm happier being by myself but being able to be me.

So make a decision.  TO BE GOOD.  TO BE YOU.  It's going to hurt.  And you're going to want to quit.  But if anything else... you can't quit.. because how else are you going to prove your mf\*\*\*ing haters wrong? Sometimes you just need to challenge that inner energy away from yourself and out into world on those who deserve it... just in a positive fashion :)

Okay one more story.. promise I'll make it quick.  It's not about me but it's about someone I know who is probably the strongest person I've ever met.  Please be aware abuse is involved.  It may trigger you.  I don't want that to happen.

As a young child she was abused by her alcoholic father.  In the most horrible of ways possible.  She lived in that hell hole and went to college.  Was told she'd make nothing of herself.  She dropped out the first time around, I'm not sure why tbh.  Many would be so beaten down by this point from the abuse alone... I don't even know if I could keep going at this point.  She's still pretty young at this point in time.  Anyway, comes home to find the locks changed.  She doesn't live there anymore.  She's now homeless on top of it all.  Got married.. to an abuser. Really just never got a chance to enjoy anything as a child, teenager, young adult.  But in-between all of this (plus I'm sure a lot more that I'm not aware of) she took that energy and basically used it to say F\*\*\* YOU to her father.  She went back to school and killed it.  Became an RN, made close to 6 figures for many years.  Homeless to completely self sufficient.  There were a lot of other struggles and bs she went through. A stillborn, another asshole husband.  But she always kept going.  She f\*\*\* proved them wrong.  If I'm half the woman she is at any point in my life.. I'll consider myself to be doing okay.

Please reach out to someone if you need to talk.  A hot line... text line.. teachers... a psychologist / psychiatrist. If you're being abused in any form tell someone.  You are good enough.  And you deserve to have a good life, doing things that make you you. You deserve so many great things, just remind yourself of that. And if all else fails what do you do?  

Prove the mf\*\*ers wrong. Rub it in their faces that they didn't bring you down. (Figuratively).

And if you feel like you're completely alone right now.  Just remember, there's another soul in the world who is thinking about you and hoping for the best possible everything to be sent your way.  You'll probably never meet.  But there's another nobody thinking about you.  You're not alone.",t2_l9m92avr,False,,0,False,Thoughts from no one.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place but I need some helpalso sorry if theres bad formatting, I dont really post on reddit

(Me and this girl are highschoolers now, met in the past through club swimming)

One of my friends has been thinking about suicide for many years now. I have known her for about 6 years now and we used to date but not anymore. She has a strict korean mom who expects alot as her siblings are both doctors and lawyers. In her sports she does swimming, and while the rest of our friends get sad when we dont get a personal record she fears her moms reaction to her not getting better.

She has a serious inferiority complex, low self esteem, and virtually no self confidence

In the past, she would often times just randomly bring up suicide, which of course me and my friends would take seriously, but she did it so often, that it almost felt like she was seeking attention. I broke up with her as I couldn't stand her treating like a litteral holy goddess and being a therapist anymore as I litterally am just a normal highschool guy with no experience being a therapist. We still talked but eventually stopped talking until about two years ago

Now that we have both entered high school (separate schools), when we meet up at swim practice (like two times a week) she is seems completely normal. She used to be super quiet and not socialize with any girls, only guys but now she was super outgoing (although she only talks to guys)

Her mom is strict like any other asian parent, and wants her child to stop playing games all the time and hanging out with friends to instead study away so she will become a doctor like her siblings. At first I thought her mom was abusive, but when I we talked about suicide, and how much she hated her mom, when i ask her if i should report her to police, or have someone check to make sure shes not being abused, she alwasy says no like its not that bad.

I thought she was just seeking attention, as if she was it really works, but then she started cutting herself on her legs and hands with the messages like DIE and things like that. I didnt know until one day I spotted it when we were swimming. Her mom found out and got really mad at her, but nothing changed, it continued even with her mom knowing but she would always have bandaids on the cuts (it wasnt a normal thing like every day, but maybe once a month).

I called suicide hotline to see what they thought but they gave generic responces like be there for her and such, but I cant bring myself to coddle her anymore as I have been doing it for the past 2-3 years. I feel like her suicide comments are just attention grabbers but I have no idea. One day when we were talking abotu colleges, she just randomly said oh yeah im not going to college cuz ill be killing myself.

Now she has another boyfriend, which another thing ill say is that she has little to no female friends at school as she cant make any, but at swim practice our group is mainly guys and she continues to hug and get close to the other guys and essentially hit on them even though she has a boyfriend. This really solidified my idea that she is just seeking attention but apparently her boyfriend is ok with it?? (they got together because they were close friends and one day the guy grabbed her boobs). Although there are many things wrong here her boyfriend and her care about each other and the bf knows and tries to help her with her suicidal thoughts but regardless of being a relationship or not she continues to bring up the fact that she is going to die, and that she is not enough for him or this or that or anything.

She wont tell me what her mom does, but she cries sometimes when she has to go home, although her mom seems abusive, she seems to just be another strict Korean mom. She also isnt very open about it besides with me and her boyfriend, it almost feels like she wants to stay depressed and suicidal which by the way, she is super super cheary with the guys and such, but online or one on one she is still cheery, but sometimes her suicidal thoughts leek. none of the adults we told did anything so we are in a pinch. We are just highschoolers, to me it feels like everything is so extreme and dramatized, at this point I just want to make sure shes fine and then move on with my life

tldr; mom causes pressure at home?, super low self esteem meaning  finds herself worthless, talked lots about suicide in the past, fastforward now she is actually cutting herself, not sure if shes doing it for attention, no adults giving actual advice, it seems like she doesnt want to fix her suicidal thoughts

What should I do? Am I making a big situation out of nothing? The thought of her committing suicide and me not taking action will haunt me forever

Please help me

The only thing I&amp;#39;m not scared of is offing myself. I know where all of the guns are in the house. I already have a lot of unsent letters written that could qualify as suicide notes. Everyone would be okay if I weren&amp;#39;t here. Are there any reasons to stay?? Will things get better?&lt;/p&gt;

I know I can’t do it, I don’t want to. It would devastate so many friends and family, and I cannot handle that burden. But I keep getting closer. The urge getting worse. The image of doing it getting clearer. And I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in therapy for three years, they do not know about these thoughts. No one does. No one knows how hopeless and miserable I am. It’s the same it’s always been, I’m busy and smiling but dying inside. I just wish I could have a break.&lt;/p&gt;

meditating never really helped. I couldn’t ever still my mind. Kinda hard, you know, when you know the medicine cabinet is unlocked and open and can’t stop thinking about it. Or when you’re just so ready to hang yourself but got so fucking frustrated when you just couldn’t figure out how to tie the knot. Of course, jumping would be faster and quicker but I couldn’t do it to whoever would have to clean up the splatter.   


Why am I still in school? Why am I pretending to have it together? Why am I even bloody meditating in the first place? Cos if I don’t bludgeon myself like I would love to, you and dad don’t end up in trauma therapy. And you said I don’t need antidepressants, antidepressants are for the sick, you aren’t sick, you aren’t depressed, you’re making up your social anxiety, hahaha you have a phobia of that? how many problems you got on your list already?

&amp;#x200B;

 I’m not sick? I fucking tried to kill myself when I was eight… yeah, no one took me seriously cos of course I was “too young” for that stuff. And now I’ve been this way for more than half of my life and I’m still not taken seriously.   


You yelled at me in the ER. Lied to the doctors “she didn’t know how to use painkillers“. Sent me to school the next day even though I just couldn’t go. But if I stayed at home, the alternative was to hear you yell and scream in my ears all day and say you were gonna kill yourself before me so that I could die guilt-free.   


I was so happy when I finally opened up to you. I‘d been terrified of you as a child. So when I opened up to you about the depression and disordered eating and the abuse and you didn’t react by beating me up, I was so happy. You even got me into therapy. Only to tell me I couldn’t talk about anything to my therapist cos she’d force me to take meds and go to a hospital. And you fucking have the audacity to sit in on all my fucking therapy sessions to make sure you approve of what I say and pinch me under the table when you don’t. Fuck me for thinking anything changed.   


You said being suicidal is disgusting and selfish because I’m your only kid and dad saved all his money for me. I wish I wasn’t and he didn’t. I have to be the peacemaker between you guys and you always fight and honestly you should’ve divorced and separated. I’ve had bloody enough.

&lt;p&gt;You yelled at me in the ER. Lied to the doctors “she didn’t know how to use painkillers“. Sent me to school the next day even though I just couldn’t go. But if I stayed at home, the alternative was to hear you yell and scream in my ears all day and say you were gonna kill yourself before me so that I could die guilt-free.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so happy when I finally opened up to you. I‘d been terrified of you as a child. So when I opened up to you about the depression and disordered eating and the abuse and you didn’t react by beating me up, I was so happy. You even got me into therapy. Only to tell me I couldn’t talk about anything to my therapist cos she’d force me to take meds and go to a hospital. And you fucking have the audacity to sit in on all my fucking therapy sessions to make sure you approve of what I say and pinch me under the table when you don’t. Fuck me for thinking anything changed.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You said being suicidal is disgusting and selfish because I’m your only kid and dad saved all his money for me. I wish I wasn’t and he didn’t. I have to be the peacemaker between you guys and you always fight and honestly you should’ve divorced and separated. I’ve had bloody enough.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just staying for you because you have nothing better to do. I’m being horrible right now but that’s the truth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing I want to do in life. Nothing at all. I’m bored and disgusted by it. You know what, maybe I’ll be selfish today. I don’t care about anyone anymore and I‘m not staying alive for their gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
