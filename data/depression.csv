###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,2,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2362,301,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2362,,False,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 21, 'gid_2': 2}",,True,,1572360722.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

,depression,"Hey y’all. 
Ive been suffering from suicidal thoughts and depression since I was 15 years old. I guess I never really processed how much I was going through until I came to college. I didn’t realize smoking and drinking everyday for months at a time at 16 years old was probably just a manifestation of my depression. I even remember writing a suicide note on my 16th birthday telling myself I’m never going to make it past my 21st birthday. That being said, my 21st is coming around the corner and my depression is overwhelming me. I simply cannot stop thinking about it. I had an exam yesterday and the entire time, I was thinking about killing myself. I know I’ve accomplished a lot so far and I am really proud of myself for everything I do despite knowing I am suffering. But it’s getting to a point where I don’t see a point in this anymore. I no longer enjoy the things I used to enjoy. I cannot even sit still for a second without the depressive thoughts overwhelming me.

He knows I have mental illness but does not know the extent of it. I can never tell him especially now because he recently lost his brother to suicide and it will destroy him if he found out I am also suicidal. I’m hoping I accidentally overdose on coke or something so it doesn’t seem like I was suicidal and I was just being stupid.

,depression,"Every moment of every single day I drown in regret.

Sometimes I see the light and bathe in it for a while, but then soon after I find a way to dwell on everything negative.

I am a 31 (m), and I had a lot of promise up to this point. I still do, but I am stuck and finding difficulty in forgiving myself and moving forward.

I regret big things that negatively impacted my whole life...but I also regret all the smaller things that one could easily learn from and improve.

Concerning the big things...when I was 23 I left an internship doing my exact passion in life after graduating college. This was going to pave way to me getting a Master's Degree fully paid for. Like a complete idiot, I had a panic attack after reading things on the internet and believed the world was about to end (right after the 2012 hype).

And so I didn't finish my internship...and didn't take the opportunity to go to graduate school (why do this when the world is about to end, right?). I ended up losing all my professional references and reputation, which kickstarted nearly ten years of debilitating depression (and the world didn't end...I really messed that one up!).

I moved back home with my parents and completely abandoned my career path. The depression got worse, and my physical health got worse, too. I worked a menial job for years drowning in self-loathing.

And guess what...when I was 28 I was given another awesome opportunity to change my course in life. Something I was passionate about related to my career path...but I still did not move on from my previous missed opportunity. And so I found a way to sabotage that opportunity, causing me to spiral into even deeper depression.

And here I am at age 31...still living with my parents. Unable to move forward in life...still stuck in the year 2013. All I dream about is going back in time and re-doing EVERYTHING.

The last ten years I have become a negative, depressed, isolated shell of a human being. Before 2013 I was so full of passion, determination, and gratitude for life.

And when I reflect on my life the last ten years...I drown in regret, guilt, and shame. And then I feel worse because I cannot extend forgiveness to myself and move on.

I could have done so much the last ten years. I can see the path I could have taken...I could have had an amazing career and helped so many people.

And then I start regretting all the smaller things. I could have studied more in college, and I could have drank less alcohol. I could have spent more time improving myself by working out and gaining confidence. I could have experienced romantic love, but I was too proud and judgmental of others.

I could have done everything different.

Many would say that I am still young and can still do awesome things in life.

The problem is that I am so mentally scarred from years of depression. Also, my physical health is horrible. I have Lyme Disease, Hashimoto Diease (thyroid), and my teeth are rotting because of lack of self-care. And my hair is falling out due to all the stress over the years. So...I am permanently scarred from the last decade as a reminder of this time period in my life.

Also...things are harder when you are older. In college I was in a nice bubble from the real world...and I feel like I squandered it.

I want nothing more than to go back and re-do everything starting at the age of 18. I can forgive myself for things before the age of 18...but at the age of 18 was when I should have taken control of my life and health.

Even with serious introspection to derive lessons I have learned to improve myself and grow...it does not change the fact that I still messed up. I could always have made a different choice while learning those lessons. I have tried therapy for six months...doesn't work for me. It is not enough because it does not give me the time back I wasted.

Misery. I want to move on...but I just do not see how it is possible.

,depression,"Single 29 year old female with 2 dogs and 0 kids and 0 friends. I’ve been extremely depressed since I was a kid but always thought I’d grow out of it and life would fall into place. The last 2 years have destroyed a lot of progress I made mentally because of working from home/living alone and being in complete and total isolation for over 2 years now. Was lonely before but this has been an absolute mind fuck. I have been trying my best to maintain sanity and have a shrink and decided to finish my college degree but the loneliness just stings no matter what I do to fill my time.

But lately I thought things were on the up &amp; up. Interviewed for a new position at work that’s higher paying, met a great guy I felt a connection with. College graduation is close enough now that I can see the light at the end of the “poor as fuck” tunnel. But out of nowhere, last Wednesday I got a notice that my rental company isn’t renewing my lease (not sure why, no infractions but don’t have the energy to fight it) and I can’t afford to move on such short notice as I drained my savings (which wasn’t much, just a couple thousand) about a year ago moving into this place (never live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building) and right now I only make $18 an hour so I haven’t been able to replenish savings yet. This place was a little out of my budget to begin with but it was on the lower side for rents in my area for 2 bedrooms (need an office). I just don’t have the money for a deposit, pet deposit, first months rent and paying for movers in my bank account right now. As a result I’m moving back in with my parents, 14 year old brother, and severely autistic 17 year old sister in a small house. I moved out after highschool at 18 because my mom is a high strung and mean crazy person, and with my sister being autistic and having outbursts all the time the place is a fuckin’ zoo. But this temporary move in with them will allow me to save money for a few months. 

A couple of months ago I met a guy who I really, really like and for once he seems to like me back. We made lots of plans to do a bunch of outdoorsy things like foraging and fishing because I’ve always wanted to do that stuff and he does those as hobbies already. We used to talk everyday and hung out probably 6-7 times and while we were still getting to know each other I felt like we had a good thing going with lots of potential. I told him about my having to move temporarily, and even though I’ll only be 2 hours away and work from home/have my own car so I can come see him as often as we wanted - he has dropped me as a result. Has just gone totally cold no contact and I feel like fucking shit.

I know I shouldn’t care, we weren’t dating yet. But I have such a hard time meeting men let alone decent men that reciprocate attraction. I’ve only ever had one boyfriend for 4 years and that relationship was a toxic nightmare that ended in 2017. That in tandem with the extreme loneliness I’ve been stuck inside of since being forced inside back in March of 2020, this is just such a huge let down that all seems to be coming out of nowhere. Having someone to look forward to talking to and see on a regular basis meant so much more to me than I think anyone else can understand. I am almost 30 and I’m nowhere near getting married and having kids which is honestly all I want to do with my life. So the letdown from this seems like it should roll off my back but I just cannot win. 

I cannot get close to anyone and I won’t ever be able to find a partner and live the simple life I so desperately want. On top of that I’m going to be 30 in June and I am moving back in with my parents and that living situation is going to be stressful. I’ve never been farther away from where I wanted to be. I feel utterly broken inside. If I didn’t have 2 chihuahuas who would be left unattended/unfed in the numerous days it would be before anyone noticed something was “off” because that’s how isolated I am - I would have killed myself in the garage yesterday.

I turned 30 2 months ago.

My story is pretty much I finished my degree at 22. Poor marks due to having severe depression. I did a graduate certificate too. But still not able to get into graduate school. I tried a second bachelor degree. I caught pneumonia and ended up failing a subject by 1 mark. While studying I was visiting the doctors clinic 3 times a week to treat my skin condition to arrest it. Got diagnosed at 19.

I felt defeated and worn out. I was 23. Had 2 qualifications I couldnt use and failed my 2nd degree by 1 mark.

I spent the next year working part time. But I still had a voice inside I had to eventually go back to study

At 25 I decided to work and save. I stopped going to the doctors so I can work. I got my first full time job. It felt good being able to earn. I wanted to focus on a career. I had this drive now but still was depressed. I worked weekends to save. I made some career moves and worked and saved like a madman.

At 27 I had an anxiety attack. The voice inside me was still there. Telling me to go back. I just didnt know what to study. I made the jump to sales. I did well with this company. I have been able to hold down every job I have had.

Just turned 30. Massive anxiety attack. I quit my career in sales. I had changed to another company and job killed my confidence. I felt defeated again. I also found it repetitive and felt like I was able to do alot better. Severe depression. Cant sleep. Lost motivation. I still feel I need to study. But I fear failing again. I fear not getting anywhere. I fear being a bum at 35-40 with no marketable skills. I havent been able to move out yet despite having a significant amount saved up. I was wanting to move out but now I feel I cant do it just yet.

I just got a role now as a sales analyst. And I get negative thoughts that I will fail and will not work out. I feel like I am punching way above my weight.

If I have a job I underestimate myself and get negative thoughts and dont feel good enough.  If I dont have a job, I get anxiety that I will be a bum and unemployable.

Its becoming too much. I want to move on with my life and make something of myself.

I have recently started seeing a therapist and jumped on meds. Ive managed to do ok so far but I feel I now need some extra help for that extra push.

,depression,"I don’t have even energy to write this (or go to the restroom 🚽 at this moment) but I need to. I need to talk about to release from my system. I wish I could talk about this with dad, mom, etc. someone really close to me. 

Anyways, in high school, I was always insecure because girls in my HS were horrible to hang out with, disrespectful to me, and do not take me seriously at all. We were 20 girls, not like in college, my options were really limited. I had to endure and spend my time with horrible people every single day, every single minutes of school time, etc… Maybe I’m stronger out it but it left me wounds …. Wounds ….. real wounds … 

They were so smart and I wasn’t one of them, so that made everything harder. Instead of doing the work, I would wonder how do they do it. Teachers love a couple of superior groups where you can obviously see they love them more. I hate it. It was horrible every day thing, I didn’t know any better. Everything was closed to me. 

Due to all this, I was anxious, really anxious all the god damn time 24/7 IT WAS HURTFUL. Me, myself, had stigma of doing to a therapist, was out of question and out of budget. So, I kept suffering, I kept suffering in silence of anxiety, depression, constant daily crying because of school not caring about mental health and my own mental health. They didn’t care at all and once our teacher said you have to come to school even if “mental health.” I don’t know how much she believes, maybe she was joking, but it’s not even something to be said or considered at the slightest. No teacher will compassionately extend a due date because you were having mental health. Unlike college, all of them didn’t care. You could straight up tell a teacher you’re having a hard time, they wouldn’t reply to that but will reply to anything school-related you say. Looking back and considering they were “close” teachers and there was a high academic proximity between us is REALLY REALLY FUCKING SHUCKING LUCKING SUCKING TOXIC. It’s SOOOOO TOXIC. 

Again, I was I would say and release this to someone who loves me like my dad but I know that he will internally judgme and say in his mind that “I’m complex”… and HE WILL SEE ME LESS, which probably hurts me a lot. Contrastingly, I think TRUE TRUE freedom and liberally is not giving a fuck what you’ll dad or a loved someone will say when you know it’s the right thing, because it’s the right thing, you should say it and release it ANYWAY! 

Anyways, due to depression I couldn’t r finishing school work on time so I forced extensions on teachers, everything built up, I had LARGE GOALS that were very overwhelming and I didn’t make them smaller until the last second. I was so overwhelming by my LARGE GOALS.. maybe I could have make them smaller….

So, this is a regular routine for me for 8 months
• self-hate (How can I not do the work?)
•severe and persistence body anxiety 
•loneliness (no one to share my experience with, they think I’m an A+ student but I struggle with putting time and patience into my studies (and now I learnt that’s ok)
•depression 
• disorganization 
• no community (toxic school environment) 
• no exercise 
• not really healthy food 
• And more crying, worry, anxiety, and more anxiety

I was always in Panic Mode !! Panic Mode !! Stress!! Worry!! Disorganization !! Not good enough !!

Went to the doctor today and weighed in at 150. I knew I wasn't eating much but good lord.

To expand: When I'm stressed or anxious, I stop eating, often for many days. It's not a body image thing, I just lose my appetite and drink water. And beer.

Gee, I wonder if losing 35lbs in 6 months has something to do with my mental state /s?

It's no wonder I'm in wounded animal mode all the time. Why I'm an asshole. I'm starving.

This isn't all bad - my blood pressure was borderline hypertension a couple years ago, and now it's super low. So there's that.

But I just wanted to share that I've not been taking care of myself for well over a year, and the result is fatigue, massive weight loss, and probably an eating disorder.

So to my fellow depressives: make an effort to eat food. If you can, good food. It makes a difference. Not eating makes it worse.

I think another issue I’ve been having is my lack of dating life, I don’t have a girlfriend and I used to tell myself that I’d eventually get one but I don’t even think Id have the time to even go out on a simple date which has also been crushing me, making me feel lonelier then I really am. Anyways thank you for reading this, stay safe, drink your water, take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The last year has been the worst of my life until now.

 A year ago I had everything to be happy. I was a successful student in one of the best schools in my country, I had many friends, the perfect loving girlfriend, hobbies. Life was perfect for me, I was so happy and I couldn't imagine being in a better situation. 

But slowly, depression crept it and killed all that without me even realizing what was happening.
 At first I started dropping out of classes. I tried finding excuses for that lack of interest ""I just have too much going on, I need to reduce my workload"" or ""the teacher is really bad and uninteresting"".

Then I started getting irritated by my group of friends, I started isolating myself with my girlfriend. After a few months, I pretty much only had my girlfriend in my life : I didn't go to classes at all anymore, I avoided any social encounter with my old group of friends. I lived with my gf at that time, and I would just stay in bed all day not doing anything. I would lie to my girlfriend telling her I spent the day working or something like that.

I didn't realize I was in depression back then, I thought I was just a shitty person. I thought I was uninteresting, I didn't have any passions. I thought I was lazy, unsociable. I was terrified by the idea that my girlfriend would see the ""real me"". 
A few months later I realized it was not normal, I went to see a psychiatrist to get help, I was first only diagnosed depressive and then a few weeks later we realized I was actually bipolar.

But at that time it was already too late, my girlfriend ended up breaking up with me, and I don't blame her. I had been a shitty boyfriend for too long, and she had issues of her own to deal with.

I ended up at a mental health hospital for a month until I was sufficiently stabilized. Now I've been out for a few weeks but I'm still very depressed. I have suicidal thoughts everyday and nothing brings me the slightest pleasure. The rare occasions where I manage to go outside I end up crying all my tears in public and feel even worst afterwards because I can't do anything.
Sometimes I wish my girlfriend would be there for me, I need her so badly right now but I can't ask that from her, and I don't want to depend on her for my mental health.

&lt;p&gt;A year ago I had everything to be happy. I was a successful student in one of the best schools in my country, I had many friends, the perfect loving girlfriend, hobbies. Life was perfect for me, I was so happy and I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine being in a better situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But slowly, depression crept it and killed all that without me even realizing what was happening.
 At first I started dropping out of classes. I tried finding excuses for that lack of interest &amp;quot;I just have too much going on, I need to reduce my workload&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the teacher is really bad and uninteresting&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I started getting irritated by my group of friends, I started isolating myself with my girlfriend. After a few months, I pretty much only had my girlfriend in my life : I didn&amp;#39;t go to classes at all anymore, I avoided any social encounter with my old group of friends. I lived with my gf at that time, and I would just stay in bed all day not doing anything. I would lie to my girlfriend telling her I spent the day working or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize I was in depression back then, I thought I was just a shitty person. I thought I was uninteresting, I didn&amp;#39;t have any passions. I thought I was lazy, unsociable. I was terrified by the idea that my girlfriend would see the &amp;quot;real me&amp;quot;. 
A few months later I realized it was not normal, I went to see a psychiatrist to get help, I was first only diagnosed depressive and then a few weeks later we realized I was actually bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at that time it was already too late, my girlfriend ended up breaking up with me, and I don&amp;#39;t blame her. I had been a shitty boyfriend for too long, and she had issues of her own to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up at a mental health hospital for a month until I was sufficiently stabilized. Now I&amp;#39;ve been out for a few weeks but I&amp;#39;m still very depressed. I have suicidal thoughts everyday and nothing brings me the slightest pleasure. The rare occasions where I manage to go outside I end up crying all my tears in public and feel even worst afterwards because I can&amp;#39;t do anything.
Sometimes I wish my girlfriend would be there for me, I need her so badly right now but I can&amp;#39;t ask that from her, and I don&amp;#39;t want to depend on her for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last hope to get out of that depression is also what frightens me the most : I&amp;#39;m supposed to leave for the United States in a week to do an internship for 4 months. I feel like this might help me alongside my medication to get back on track, to change environment.

,depression," 

I    started my accounting degree at 2019 at distance form because we   didn't  have enough money. I pretty much fell into believing the myth   that it's  easy cuz it has math. Back in high school, I failed to learn   proper  study habits and effectively whatever I studied was forgotten   roughly a  week after the test. During my first college exam, I was   terrified- I  had a month to study two subjects and barely could   remember anything.  And then, the professor said ""You can use your   books.'' And with liberal  book use i ended up acing the exam. Most   exams after that were open  book, and i aced and aced. But my problem   remained - whenever I tried to  study, I could barely focus. I didn't   tell my parents, because i didn't  want to worry them. Then COVID hit,   and I was introduced to the  ''wonderful'' online school, which   additionally impacted me. The final  hit was, when after my second year   my father got sick with throat  cancer. I saw the strong, wise man that   had raised me be reduced to a  bed-ridden, diaper using shell of a   person. My focusing ability crashed  to zero. Barely anything   registered, I was apathetic to everything(I  still am), I had no energy,   I stopped caring about accounting. But I  kept acing and acing. My   father died December last year and I felt that  my world had stopped.

Flashback   to  today, I have excellent grades, but my head feels(and probably is)    empty of anything, but the barest, most elementary basics. I STILL   can't  focus and remember, no matter what i try. Roughly after 15 months   i  will have to intern at an accounting firm for month and half if I   want  to get my degree. I feel utterly fucked, I've never had a job, I   hate  myself, I ponder suicide constantly.

Honestly    at this point I don't care about being an accountant, i just want job    that i don't utterly hate that pays at least slightly above minimum   wage

,depression,"I dont even know how or where i am supposed to start . Lets just say that last year i failed a certain important exam . I had been preparing for this exam since 5 years of highschool . I had no real friends , never went to parties , never cultivate any meaningful support group for foavour of studying . Why exactly did i study ? Not for myself , but for my family . I come from a dirt poor family and my parents cant possibly pay for my higher education unless i attain a scholarship by myself . Also thw situation at home was a disaster . My parents never had the happiest of marriages and i grew up between their arguments . I would pretend to be asleep and hear my mom scream stuff like ' i should have left you and the kid behind when i had the chance ' and accuse my dad of cheating on her and my dad threatening to hurt her if she didnt shut up and so on. Whatever be the case , my parents were always supportive of me . Maybe in a way i represented the dreams they never fulfilled . Whenever i would be good to them and score good grades there would be peace at home . And that motivated me to keep performing harder . They never were satisfied with my efforts , always pusing me to get better grades , work harder , but i never minded that because i knew good grades mean they get to brag about it and that means they are in a good mood . Alternatively , everytime i failed to live up to their expectations or disobeyed them in any way , all hell would break loose . My dad would scream at me and my mom would break down , calling my ungrateful and spoiled and so on . So i pretty much lived for my parents and never said anything when they enrolled me in coaching for med school scholarships. The exam was last year and i failed . And since then ive been breaking apart . I dont understand what is wrong with me , but ive been blanking out , i cant remember stuff anymore and am having concentration problems . I cont focus during the day and cant sleep at night . I waste my time on my phone . Things at home have also gotten worse . Mom breaks down almost everyday now , they both fight more often , more viciously . I realise the only way i fix this , the only way to make everything okay is to pass the exam this year . But im not so sure i can do that . And that thought frightens me . I have been seriously contemplating suicide . Its almost become an obsession with me .

Lets just say that last year i failed a certain important exam . I had been preparing for this exam since 5 years of highschool . I had no real friends , never went to parties , never cultivate any meaningful support group for foavour of studying . Why exactly did i study ? Not for myself , but for my family . I come from a dirt poor family and my parents cant possibly pay for my higher education unless i attain a scholarship by myself . Also thw situation at home was a disaster . My parents never had the happiest of marriages and i grew up between their arguments . I would pretend to be asleep and hear my mom scream stuff like &amp;#39; i should have left you and the kid behind when i had the chance &amp;#39; and accuse my dad of cheating on her and my dad threatening to hurt her if she didnt shut up and so on. Whatever be the case , my parents were always supportive of me . Maybe in a way i represented the dreams they never fulfilled . Whenever i would be good to them and score good grades there would be peace at home . And that motivated me to keep performing harder . They never were satisfied with my efforts , always pusing me to get better grades , work harder , but i never minded that because i knew good grades mean they get to brag about it and that means they are in a good mood . Alternatively , everytime i failed to live up to their expectations or disobeyed them in any way , all hell would break loose . My dad would scream at me and my mom would break down , calling my ungrateful and spoiled and so on . So i pretty much lived for my parents and never said anything when they enrolled me in coaching for med school scholarships. The exam was last year and i failed . And since then ive been breaking apart . I dont understand what is wrong with me , but ive been blanking out , i cant remember stuff anymore and am having concentration problems . I cont focus during the day and cant sleep at night . I waste my time on my phone . Things at home have also gotten worse . Mom breaks down almost everyday now , they both fight more often , more viciously . I realise the only way i fix this , the only way to make everything okay is to pass the exam this year . But im not so sure i can do that . And that thought frightens me . I have been seriously contemplating suicide . Its almost become an obsession with me . I dont want to think about it but it still sticks to my brain , the thought that i shall inevitably have to die because i cant possibly succeed this time . I try hard to study , to focus , to get back my enthusiasm , but its as though my mind is hell bent on dying . And all this makes me feel guilty . I mean really guilty .

,depression,"I have been with my partner for 14 years.
Over the past five years he has developed severe depression and anxiety.

He describes how I have been a failure at basic communication for many years now, and that has been described as the primary cause of what has now become severe depression. Not listening, not following conversation, getting confused with the flow of conversation, not being able to recall conversation, using incorrect words etc. When he is in a crisis point and I am trying very hard to help, the conversation quickly turns to my communication failures as opposed to the original reason why he reached crisis point.

His addiction to weed is blamed on me. He describes how five years ago he said we needed to be more active, do more with our free time. He says I didn't do enough, nothing changed, and so he turned to cannabis. This was initially out of boredom but has grown into a severe addiction. He is spending hundreds of pounds a month, putting himself into a large amount of debt, on weed. At it's worst he cannot go more than 4 hours, Inc. Over night, without smoking. He places all blame for this addition on me.

Last year he tried therapy and a low grade of anxiety medication via the GP. When suggesting we need to seek professional help again now, he rejects the idea. He doesn't need a 'third party' to point out all of my flaws, he says. 

As a consequence, everything is placed on my shoulders. He states I'll have blood on my hands if I don't 'fix it'. He states everything is on me, and if I express my concern with that (stating I am crippled by that pressure, I can't cope with the pressure, I need to seek help from elsewhere) I am told I am being selfish.

I have tried to explain how I am trying as hard as I possibly can to improve, but I cannot try any harder. I am pushing myself to the absolute limit to be the person he needs me to be. 

I'm experiencing the severe impacts of secondary emotion; very often called damaging words, cruel insults, with hurtful things said about my family, and verbal threats of extreme violence. I have learnt to not react to these words as they are secondary emotions (and this is also what is expected if me, if I were to react to these words I would be harshly criticised). But this doesn't make them any less damaging to hear.

In short, he is very, very sick. He places all blame for his sickness on me, and also solely looks to me to solve all of his problems.

,depression,"With my parents, my best isn't good enough and no matter what I do I get yelled at. Literally the only way to avoid getting in trouble with them is to just sit at home and never do anything fun because every time I do all it turns into is a fight. 

I literally think they deserve to see me dead, or have my run away, and know it's their fault. That's literally the only way they'd ever learn or take me seriously. 

Or at least, I should say that about my Dad. My Mom really does try and I don't think she's the problem, but she always gets roped into what my dad thinks and ends up agreeing with him in the end. 

Just today I went out with my friend. We have to use busses to get anywhere because we're too young to drive on our own (we're 16, you need to be 18 to drive without an adult), which means I completely rely on public transportation being on time in order to get home at a certain time. My Dad wanted me home by 8. 

I started heading home BEFORE 6, giving myself a ton of time. I literally did the best I possibly could have done. But I still ended up being 10 minutes late. The busses in my area are slow and absolutely terrible. 

And of course my dad acts like it's somehow my fault that the buses weren't on time. I gave myself a ton of time to get home, I did my best, and it's still not good enough for him. I wasn't even that late.

This has happened time and time again where he makes a big deal out of a few minutes, or acts like something is my fault when it was completely out of my control. I'm tired of being yelled at by him and I'm tired of having privileges taken away for things that I didn't even do wrong. 

And of course the first thing I hear as soon as I walk through the door is how bad my makeup looks and how I should stop wasting my money on stupid things.

The things that make my life tolerable are gone. And not wanting to hurt my family and friends by km starts to become less important. As if it doesn't have to do anything with me.

I feel for the past 3.5+ years I’ve been depressed and possibly a little anxious but I don’t know if I’m actually like medically depressed like my brain chemistry is actually messed up or if I’m just going through hard times. The only time I was ever depressed in my childhood was in elementary school I was bullied for about a year and a half and had extreme anxiety to the point I couldn’t sleep at all and was being prescribed sleep medicine. Other than that I feel I’ve always been extremely positive, happy, go getter, motivated, class clown, happy person. Just the past 3.5ish years I’ve felt completely defeated and like its chipping away at me. I really don’t know how to tell if I really can clinically depressed and what help I need. I’ve already spoken to my doctor and I recently started seeing a therapist. 

I just feel very demotivated almost always, I procrastinate everything, I don’t really get anything more than the bare minimum done everyday for example, college assignments, go to work every week, somewhat consistent gym, that’s about it. I want to do much more. Some days I feel immensely more sad and just heavy. I have also recently started experiencing panic attacks maybe? Like my hands and feet kind of feel tingly or numb and my chest feels really tight like it’s hard to breath. This really only happens when I’m alone thinking a lot. Normally in public, at work, at school I’m a pretty confident person. I like to take charge and lead and I’m fairly social but still have these really depressive feelings like I’m just always super sad and normal things that should make me happy haven’t been for these past 3.5+ years and I feel I can’t control myself to do more throughout the day or make myself happier. 

My doctor prescribed my escitalopram(lexapro generic) 5mg to try but I’m really scared. I’ve always been against antidepressants. I don’t want it messing up my brain chemistry, permanently changing or damaging me or making my condition worse. I’m just worried about so many different side effects and the whole unnaturally messing with the brain scares me. 

It also scares me because what if I’m not actually depressed or anxious and I’m still taking this? How can I really know if I have these mental conditions? 

I’m sitting here typing this considering whether I should take the first pill of escitalopram and try it daily but I really don’t know what to do.

Can people who are clinically depressed help themselves naturally to be a normal functioning person or do some people absolutely need antidepressants to ever function normally?

I know this won’t get any attention, and I don’t really want much, just maybe guidance from another with similar experiences. I know that sounds weird, but I just wanted to share what I’ve been through. I’m not looking for any new friends, for reasons explained later if you read that far. (Also sorry for shitty grammar, I’m pretty retarded.) (Also this is a repost my post got removed in another sub) (Repost repost because I don’t know where else to put this)

So, on with the “story” now. It started when I had to move to Texas because of my dad’s job, which I was not very excited about. The move from Virginia to Texas was a massive change in my life, and that’s when everything started going downhill. Due to the sadness of leaving my life-long home in Virginia, I stopped eating as much and still don’t for some reason. I did make a lot of friends, met the bully, who I’ll just call “Ass” and was having a pretty below average time, until the divorce. My parent’s divorce completely changed the way I thought and lived. I stopped making friends, stopped talking to people, and that’s when the minor self-harm started with my fingernails. After the divorce, my dad, the one with the job, stopped helping us pay for the house. The bullying from Ass got worse and worse, and I couldn’t defend myself due to anxiety and being just weak overall. My mom, who I decided to stay with, thought of moving into an RV due to money issues. Then the move to the RV happened, and I just didn’t know how to feel about it. 

Ass still bullied me by stabbing me with pencils, kicking me, and picking me up and throwing me due to my tiny frame from under-eating. This led to my severe PTSD, so I have a huge fear of being around potential people to meet, due to not wanting to go through the same experience with Ass. One day, I really lost all hope I had. So I was on Discord, with the remaining friends I had, and gave one of them admin over my server. This short part may seem stupid, but I was traumatized by Ass. So my best, most trustworthy friend, whom I granted the admin, started to do a “minuscule amount of trolling.” He made a rival server, planned an attack using bots, made a shitty diss track, and called my server corrupt and garbage due to my lack of trust in most people, while all my other friends were against me too. This is what caused me to lose 8 friends, which were all I had. That event evolved my PTSD tenfold, and caused my self-harm to become more rampant, using sharp objects. After that school year ended, my mom decided to put the RV to use, and take a trip across the country. Although I had escaped Ass, I still had to be cooped up with my sister and mom, which was not ideal for me. The trip was nice, and I am still on that very trip, but my mental health has been deteriorating. I don’t know how to feel, as I am having violent dreams and ideas of hurting others, but that goes against my own morals. I don’t know if I’m the victim, or I’m the reason of how I am. It’s just confusing, and I had to put this somewhere. 

I shortened this a lot, excluding a view major details for privacy of course, but I hope at least one person understands a little. 

TLDR: Got bullied, developed quite a few mental issues, and parents got divorced. I moved into an RV, having to be cooped up with my mom and sister. My mental health rapidly deteriorated, and still is.

,depression,"I'm writing this in multiple subs since I'm not sure where it belongs.

Do you ever get the urge to completely withdraw from people? 

You feel exhausted from even thinking about being in social settings. Whether that be meeting friends, family, going to the supermarket, the park, even just greeting your neighbour or stepping outside where you know you'll see people. 
You don't want to talk, noises are especially stressful on these days, you can't take a lot of input. Reading or doing another peaceful hobby in the quiet of your room, no one near you, seems like the only thing that doesn't stress you out. And by stressing out I mean if you ignore this urge and step out nevertheless you're guaranteed to get a panic attack.

Not the usual I feel drained from social interactions, or I'm stressed I can't focus on anything or being exhausted for other reasons. It's the desire to hide from everyone that might interact with or just perceive you no matter the duration. I do wish I had a cave no one knew about far away from everyone where I can hide for these days.


It doesn't last for long, sometimes only one day, rarely more than three days. And then it doesn't happen again for weeks.

I'm curious wherever some of you might experience the same, if you know what it means and where it comes from. 
If so then what do you do on these days? Do you just ignore it, accept a few very stressful days? Does it go away after a while? Or do you listen to the urge and hide at home for as long as it lasts?

,depression,"I just want somewhere to vent. Sorry if this bothers you



Let's short it up. My mother had me when she was like 18 with my dad(17 at the time) ever since I was born I lived with my dad side (grandparents, aunts) I've never seen my mom. I also rarely make any contact with my dad cuz he moved to another place and had a new family. Well all these made me think that no one loves me. But aight



And tbh that makes me feel like I shouldn't be born on the first place. I tried to go to therapy when I was in middle school but I just couldn't express all my problems because they had my aunt sitting next to me during the session. So I just lied about being bullied at school for being gay blah blah. They gave me some prescription and just that



It did seem to get better but No. Lately over the past year I just feel like I'm a mistake and just some parasite of the family. Like the rest of my family would live in their better lives without me. I feel like wishing my mom to abort me in the first place.



Whenever my family buy me something nice or take me to anywhere. I just always think to myself ""Their lives would be easier If I was aborted in the first place"" like my family would be better off without me



And I also struggling with being insecure about myself (my face, my body, my future, my education) so all of them combined just makes me feel worse about myself harder and harder everyday



Any advices? Maybe something I could do to feel better about myself 



Thanks for the advice (If theres any). just want to be here and vent cuz I don't know where else I would express my feeling


Thanks guys :)",t2_g1bzab8l,False,,0,False,The feeling of being a parasite of my family,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tnq8tt,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648226589.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want somewhere to vent. Sorry if this bothers you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s short it up. My mother had me when she was like 18 with my dad(17 at the time) ever since I was born I lived with my dad side (grandparents, aunts) I&amp;#39;ve never seen my mom. I also rarely make any contact with my dad cuz he moved to another place and had a new family. Well all these made me think that no one loves me. But aight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tbh that makes me feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t be born on the first place. I tried to go to therapy when I was in middle school but I just couldn&amp;#39;t express all my problems because they had my aunt sitting next to me during the session. So I just lied about being bullied at school for being gay blah blah. They gave me some prescription and just that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did seem to get better but No. Lately over the past year I just feel like I&amp;#39;m a mistake and just some parasite of the family. Like the rest of my family would live in their better lives without me. I feel like wishing my mom to abort me in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever my family buy me something nice or take me to anywhere. I just always think to myself &amp;quot;Their lives would be easier If I was aborted in the first place&amp;quot; like my family would be better off without me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also struggling with being insecure about myself (my face, my body, my future, my education) so all of them combined just makes me feel worse about myself harder and harder everyday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advices? Maybe something I could do to feel better about myself &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice (If theres any). just want to be here and vent cuz I don&amp;#39;t know where else I would express my feeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys :)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"( tw self harm )

on some level i think i resent my parents. when i was around 12, i was going through a lot of mental health issues and it resulted in me finding online communities surrounding depression and self harm. i dont really remember what drew me to them, but i think i was subconsciously depressed (i had just gone through two cross-state moves in under two years) and felt seen by the people there. it eventually led to me adopting eating disorder behaviors and starting self harm. i think that at the time i didn't fully understand why i liked it. i think it was probably a sense of control that i craved. 

i became accustomed to posting images of my cuts online because that was what i saw other people doing and i enjoyed the attention it gave me. i suppose i wasn't careful enough making sure who followed me because one of my friends from school ended up seeing them and told her mother, who then told my parents. my parents then called me into their room and sat me down and made me tell them everything i was doing. the fasting, the exercising, the cutting, the online community, everything. they made me show them my cuts and my scars. i remember very clearly the way my mother cried and how cold her fingers were on my wrist. i am a bit fuzzy on more of the details, but i think that it was then that they started to freak out. my dad slept on the floor of my room to make sure i didn't kill myself and after that my mom was constantly asking to see my legs and my wrists. when i had new cuts, she would just look at me in this way like she was so disappointed. she would have me bring her my blades under threat of looking for them in my things herself. this continued throughout my middle school years up until high school, which i think is when i got a lot better at hiding it and eventually stopped cutting as much.

my issue is, that feeling of being ""caught,"" of them forcing me to tell them everything and then of being under constant surveillance and constantly being watched has stuck with me for years. i'm 21 now and i still think back to that day. i can still feel the shock and pain of watching my mother cry. i feel that they probably could have handled the situation a lot better, in a way that didn't make me feel like i was getting in trouble for having poor mental health. i have been unable to open up to my parents since then and still find myself hiding things from them. they are clearly trying hard to make themselves seem like they are a place for me to go when i'm hurting, but i don't feel safe or comfortable going to them. i can't just forget the way they treated me when they first found out. i think it makes me hate them, in a way. i feel a bit guilty for feeling this way because i know they were probably reacting how they thought was best and they just wanted me to be safe, but it still hurt me. i feel like i'm hurt. and i don't know if they can do anything to fix that.",t2_2nzodyu5,False,,0,False,i resent my parents for how they reacted,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tnpnhk,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648225560.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;( tw self harm )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I cope with this? Ive never felt this sad in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Please read if you have the time. I guess it's not that important, but... I guess TL;DR is that life seems to have destroyed all my hopes to be happy.

I've always tried to be a good person. I've made mistakes like everyone else. But it seems like my life has reached a dead end that seems totally redundant. I'm ready to die. I don't hate myself. In fact, I hope that I die who I am today. I'm a smart guy, who is humble enough to admit when I'm wrong and I try to look at life and morality objectively.

I don't think it's schizophrenia anymore. There was a time when I dismissed audio hallucinations as nothing but hallucinations because I didn't want to be schizophrenic. I didn't want my life to be defined by schizophrenia. I knew what schizophrenia was, and didn't want to allow it to influence my life. I've witnessed things since then that make it undeniable from my perspective that I'm not schizophrenic. I guess that's what a schizo would say, huh?
Growing up I kept lowering my own bar over and over again. When voices and delusional sensations of being spiritually assaulted at work made it impossible for me to hold down my first job, I started trying other lines of work to try to find something that didn't bother me. My first work experience was as a carpenter, and, even though I suffered from hallucinations then, I performed fine, if not above average. By the time I was twenty years old, I had devolved from working at a grocery store, to working as a dishwasher, to working as a tax preparer, to taking temp jobs in a desperate attempt to earn money at all. At one time I wanted to join the air force, but... I neglected the opportunity because I planned on getting married to my highschool sweetheart. She cheated on me repeatedly, and I couldn't just keep giving her second chances. God, I miss the cat we adopted when we were together... He was my baby.

At this point in my life I've tried to kill myself more times than I can count, and constantly fail. From a realistic perspective, the only explanation I have is that somewhere deep down, my schizophrenic self refuses to die, so I lose bodily control during suicide attempts.. I periodically go through attempts to slit my throat even now.

The pain I've suffered from at the hands of my ""spiritual"" experience is far beyond repair. I don't expect anything good out of anyone anymore. I don't expect anyone to like me. I'm fucked up emotionally. I used to be a hopeless romantic, but now I feel like I'm unfit to love someone. All my life I wanted devote myself to environmental efforts, and otherwise just wanted to live decently with the woman I loved. I didn't have delusions of grandeur. Instead I have voices haunting me, saying that they're god, or someone who's trapped me in a simulation. Even if I could prove that none of it was real, I'd just want to kill myself anyways. Who could love someone like me? I'm fucking crazy. I'm fucked up inside, and worse yet, I would've fucked myself up on the inside with my own delusions. I don't expect a happy ending.

,depression,"Beware, this is something I just pumped out while balling by eyes out. Don’t know if there’s typos or anything like that, I only know it’s long as fuck. Here ya go strangers on the internet. 

After high school I went to college. I broke my hand playing football, abused the oxycodone, started flunking my classes, and dropped out of college.
So I came back home to Texas, got a job working at Burnet County Jail. Did that for a few months and started dating a girl. Spent so much time with the girl that I fell asleep during my night shift and falsified paperwork to try to hide it. I was caught, fired, and arrested for Falsification of Government Documents. Looking back I should’ve quit because I wasn’t happy at the job and I don’t regret spending time with the girl.
So I continue to see this girl and life is good. She even manages to accidentally get me a job interview for Tractor Supply. She even moves in with me.
Then my truck gets crashed. Had to fix that. She gets sick and can’t work so I support us. Then she quits her job. I pick up another job to try to support us until she can get another. That truck no longer works so I have to use my dad’s. She eventually gets lined up to work at the Hughs Unit prison in Gatesville. All the while family drama is happening because the house is FULL with my family at this point.
I quit one of my jobs now that we can support each other. Life is really good for a while.
She are happy despite everything. She gets pregnant I’m overjoyed. My beautiful baby boy, Atlas Benjamin Calkins. I promised I would be a good father and husband. So we got married. I get lined up for a new job at Clements/Parsons Elementary. And we’re getting close to moving into a house of our own.
Then everything changed. On the morning of November 28th, 2020 she was in a horrible car accident. I got the call while I was driving to work that morning. I had been calling and calling over and over to try to make sure she got home ok. I got a call back from a paramedic and he told me what happened. He told me to go to a hospital in Killeen. So I drive there and wait. And I wait. I wait until they finally tell me that she is at a different hospital.
I start racing to Temple, getting a call from her doctor while driving telling me what to do once I get there and trying to ask me questions. I finally get there and sit in the ER waiting room. More waiting. I’m eventually taken to a private waiting room. A doctor comes in a little later to tell me everything. She was in surgery. All they knew for certain at that point was that she had broken her femur. He told me to have hope that Atlas survived. I appreciate him doing everything he could to save my wife… but I resent him for giving me that false hope. I sat in that small room fluctuating between “Are my wife and son dead?” to “is my wife dead and I have to raise my son alone?” to “is my wife going to make it but we lost Atlas?” to “will they both make it and we’ll be celebrating an early birthday for him?”. I would soon get my answer. He was gone. I was devastated. I wanted to burn the world. To destroy everything I could see. But I had no energy, so I just sat there. Paralyzed. Watching my world crumble while I couldn’t do anything to stop it.
I knew I had to be with my wife. When she was finally stable I was able to sit with her. She was still asleep, and whenever she did wake up she was too delirious to comprehend anything. I watched as her body struggled. Intubated and covered in scratches and bruises. The biggest thing that hit me was the emptiness under the blanket where Atlas always was. The huge baby bump.. gone. Family and friends came. She could only have one visitor at a time because of Covid regulations so I had to pull myself away so that others could see her. They asked me if I wanted to see Atlas. I made sure that nobody would see him until my wife was awake and we could see him together. I stayed day and night. She woke up. And I had to tell her that Atlas was gone. We cried so hard. She was still intubated so she couldn’t speak still. The moment they brought Atlas into the room I almost threw up. I was shaking and crying so hard. Seeing my wife hold him should’ve been a beautiful sight and one I had been looking forward to for months. But there was no joy here. Only heartbreak and death. I held his cold limp body in my hands and my mind raced through all of the moments that would never come. We had him cremated. I was against any splitting of his ashes for jewelry or anything wrong like that. It felt disgusting. 
My wife started her recovery process, pushing herself far harder than she probably should have. Before I knew it we were out of the hospital and back home. I was always there, taking care of her and helping her with anything she needed. There was only one small spark of joy and love left in the world and I was going to hold onto her with everything I had.
Time came for me to start my new job at the Elementary School. Every day I died inside. Being around those wonderful kids broke my heart and reminded me of everything I had lost.  I found myself making excuses just so I could go cry my heart out away from the kids.
I still loved those awesome kids. I tried my hardest to treat them like I imagined I would treat Atlas. And then we moved into our new place. We had so much help from family and friends. We began the process of truly trying to pick up the pieces of our life. 
I tried so hard to support us and take care of the house and my wife. Thankfully we had support from family and friends to help us get by. I regret that I’m horrible at house work. I really did try. But I failed. And failed. 
Slowly life started to become more secure. She eventually stated work again. She struggled and I tried my hardest to try to support her and make sure she had everything she needed. But I still failed around the house. 
Then I got a call telling me that I have Court. After all this time I’m finally dealing with the charges from my job at the Jail. I go through the process and and am put on probation for a year. Now I can’t start throwing my money at the fines and fees associated with that along with giving my wife any money she needed to help with bills. But I pushed onward.
We started to try to build a shed. That failed because of my incompetence. I let the house become a disaster. I didn’t do enough to fix it. I was failing at being a husband. I was slowly killing my marriage, but I didn’t realize it at the time…
Then I get fired from my job. A kid threw a tantrum and I was told there was a mark left on his arm while I was trying to calm him down. I was fired the same day. Agin everything I was trying to to was crumbling because I wasn’t good enough. Because I had failed.
So I try to find a new job while she supports us.
I find a nice job at Alta Loma, a mental health and addiction recovery center. It’s a good job and I still work there. 
My wife is working so many hours. The prison is majorly understaffed and she’s being forced to work outrageous hours for a pay half of what she deserves. It’s because of these hours that she crashed in the first place. And now it was putting extra strain on our marriage. Between her job and my inadequacy, our marriage was dying. 
She was constantly telling me “You need therapy"" and “we both need therapy” but I didn’t think I needed it. I was still sad about Atlas but I had come to terms with his death. But I didn’t realize that when she said “we both need therapy” she meant “we need therapy”. I didn’t realize until it was too late. It was during this time that I made my biggest mistake yet. The anvil that broke the camel’s back. I’ll leave it out due to privacy reasons. But it wasn’t infidelity or anything like that. Just a misunderstanding that shattered the cracked window. And again. I didn’t know this until much later.
We hadn’t been sleeping in the same room for a while. She told me because it was dirty, but she eventually told me the truth. She was afraid of me. She finally let everything out and told me everything. I was mortified at myself. I tried every day to make up for what I had done. She was so distant from me. I tried giving her space and anything else I could think of. But nothing worked.
And then our landlord told us that our lease would not be renewed and we had to get out. Fun. So we made arrangements to move in with her dad. We got a storage unit for our things and we moved in.
I slept on the couch/recliner. Alternating between the two whenever my back started to hurt too much from one or the other. I kept trying to fix things. Even letting myself believe that things might slowly be getting better. But it wasn’t true. Everything was wrong. She told me that she just didn’t care. About me or anything I did. I was nothing. She didn’t love me. I was just there. My heart was truly broken for the second time.
I kept trying though. I even tried therapy. But everything I did was nothing. None of it mattered. She was done. 
Then came the day she told me to pack my shit as she got into a friends truck to go to work. I had a panic attack like nothing I’d ever dealt before. The world was so wrong. I cried and screamed and threw up and begged God for any help. Anything to fix this. No answer came. I called work to tell them I couldn’t come in that night. I still feel bad for crying so loud over the phone. I called my parents to finally tell them everything and that I had to stay with them. Everything was truly wrong.
Every day she posts several things. Almost all of them hurt me and tear at my soul. I try to text her to try to talk to her. She says very mean things. She even blocked me because I was bothering her. I tried to keep fighting even then. The day she gave to ring back to me, she dropped it into my palm like she was letting go of something that was burning her. Finally glad to be rid of something that was causing her so much pain. We talked to my parents because they asked us to and she agreed to a separation with the promise to work on ourselves and slowly try to work on each other.
I was given that same false hope I felt back in the hospital. She later told me that she only agreed out of respect to my parents. That once she walks through the door she’s not turning back. I don’t know if I have any fight left or if I even should. She’s hurt me so much. Said so many things. I want to hate her for everything that’s going on. I want to blame her for anything. But I can’t. I did this. I let it fall apart. As much as people say it was both of us, I just don’t see it.
I love her so much. I want to stop. To be able to turn it off. But no matter what I do I still have this undying raging love for her, my moonlight.

And that brings us to now. My life is really something. I have my birthday coming up in a few days. Turning 22. Yay.

Then my truck gets crashed. Had to fix that. She gets sick and can’t work so I support us. Then she quits her job. I pick up another job to try to support us until she can get another. That truck no longer works so I have to use my dad’s. She eventually gets lined up to work at the Hughs Unit prison in Gatesville. All the while family drama is happening because the house is FULL with my family at this point.
I quit one of my jobs now that we can support each other. Life is really good for a while.
She are happy despite everything. She gets pregnant I’m overjoyed. My beautiful baby boy, Atlas Benjamin Calkins. I promised I would be a good father and husband. So we got married. I get lined up for a new job at Clements/Parsons Elementary. And we’re getting close to moving into a house of our own.
Then everything changed. On the morning of November 28th, 2020 she was in a horrible car accident. I got the call while I was driving to work that morning. I had been calling and calling over and over to try to make sure she got home ok. I got a call back from a paramedic and he told me what happened. He told me to go to a hospital in Killeen. So I drive there and wait. And I wait. I wait until they finally tell me that she is at a different hospital.
I start racing to Temple, getting a call from her doctor while driving telling me what to do once I get there and trying to ask me questions. I finally get there and sit in the ER waiting room. More waiting. I’m eventually taken to a private waiting room. A doctor comes in a little later to tell me everything. She was in surgery. All they knew for certain at that point was that she had broken her femur. He told me to have hope that Atlas survived. I appreciate him doing everything he could to save my wife… but I resent him for giving me that false hope. I sat in that small room fluctuating between “Are my wife and son dead?” to “is my wife dead and I have to raise my son alone?” to “is my wife going to make it but we lost Atlas?” to “will they both make it and we’ll be celebrating an early birthday for him?”. I would soon get my answer. He was gone. I was devastated. I wanted to burn the world. To destroy everything I could see. But I had no energy, so I just sat there. Paralyzed. Watching my world crumble while I couldn’t do anything to stop it.
I knew I had to be with my wife. When she was finally stable I was able to sit with her. She was still asleep, and whenever she did wake up she was too delirious to comprehend anything. I watched as her body struggled. Intubated and covered in scratches and bruises. The biggest thing that hit me was the emptiness under the blanket where Atlas always was. The huge baby bump.. gone. Family and friends came. She could only have one visitor at a time because of Covid regulations so I had to pull myself away so that others could see her. They asked me if I wanted to see Atlas. I made sure that nobody would see him until my wife was awake and we could see him together. I stayed day and night. She woke up. And I had to tell her that Atlas was gone. We cried so hard. She was still intubated so she couldn’t speak still. The moment they brought Atlas into the room I almost threw up. I was shaking and crying so hard. Seeing my wife hold him should’ve been a beautiful sight and one I had been looking forward to for months. But there was no joy here. Only heartbreak and death. I held his cold limp body in my hands and my mind raced through all of the moments that would never come. We had him cremated. I was against any splitting of his ashes for jewelry or anything wrong like that. It felt disgusting. 
My wife started her recovery process, pushing herself far harder than she probably should have. Before I knew it we were out of the hospital and back home. I was always there, taking care of her and helping her with anything she needed. There was only one small spark of joy and love left in the world and I was going to hold onto her with everything I had.
Time came for me to start my new job at the Elementary School. Every day I died inside. Being around those wonderful kids broke my heart and reminded me of everything I had lost.  I found myself making excuses just so I could go cry my heart out away from the kids.
I still loved those awesome kids. I tried my hardest to treat them like I imagined I would treat Atlas. And then we moved into our new place. We had so much help from family and friends. We began the process of truly trying to pick up the pieces of our life. 
I tried so hard to support us and take care of the house and my wife. Thankfully we had support from family and friends to help us get by. I regret that I’m horrible at house work. I really did try. But I failed. And failed. 
Slowly life started to become more secure. She eventually stated work again. She struggled and I tried my hardest to try to support her and make sure she had everything she needed. But I still failed around the house. 
Then I got a call telling me that I have Court. After all this time I’m finally dealing with the charges from my job at the Jail. I go through the process and and am put on probation for a year. Now I can’t start throwing my money at the fines and fees associated with that along with giving my wife any money she needed to help with bills. But I pushed onward.
We started to try to build a shed. That failed because of my incompetence. I let the house become a disaster. I didn’t do enough to fix it. I was failing at being a husband. I was slowly killing my marriage, but I didn’t realize it at the time…
Then I get fired from my job. A kid threw a tantrum and I was told there was a mark left on his arm while I was trying to calm him down. I was fired the same day. Agin everything I was trying to to was crumbling because I wasn’t good enough. Because I had failed.
So I try to find a new job while she supports us.
I find a nice job at Alta Loma, a mental health and addiction recovery center. It’s a good job and I still work there. 
My wife is working so many hours. The prison is majorly understaffed and she’s being forced to work outrageous hours for a pay half of what she deserves. It’s because of these hours that she crashed in the first place. And now it was putting extra strain on our marriage. Between her job and my inadequacy, our marriage was dying. 
She was constantly telling me “You need therapy&amp;quot; and “we both need therapy” but I didn’t think I needed it. I was still sad about Atlas but I had come to terms with his death. But I didn’t realize that when she said “we both need therapy” she meant “we need therapy”. I didn’t realize until it was too late. It was during this time that I made my biggest mistake yet. The anvil that broke the camel’s back. I’ll leave it out due to privacy reasons. But it wasn’t infidelity or anything like that. Just a misunderstanding that shattered the cracked window. And again. I didn’t know this until much later.
We hadn’t been sleeping in the same room for a while. She told me because it was dirty, but she eventually told me the truth. She was afraid of me. She finally let everything out and told me everything. I was mortified at myself. I tried every day to make up for what I had done. She was so distant from me. I tried giving her space and anything else I could think of. But nothing worked.
And then our landlord told us that our lease would not be renewed and we had to get out. Fun. So we made arrangements to move in with her dad. We got a storage unit for our things and we moved in.
I slept on the couch/recliner. Alternating between the two whenever my back started to hurt too much from one or the other. I kept trying to fix things. Even letting myself believe that things might slowly be getting better. But it wasn’t true. Everything was wrong. She told me that she just didn’t care. About me or anything I did. I was nothing. She didn’t love me. I was just there. My heart was truly broken for the second time.
I kept trying though. I even tried therapy. But everything I did was nothing. None of it mattered. She was done. 
Then came the day she told me to pack my shit as she got into a friends truck to go to work. I had a panic attack like nothing I’d ever dealt before. The world was so wrong. I cried and screamed and threw up and begged God for any help. Anything to fix this. No answer came. I called work to tell them I couldn’t come in that night. I still feel bad for crying so loud over the phone. I called my parents to finally tell them everything and that I had to stay with them. Everything was truly wrong.
Every day she posts several things. Almost all of them hurt me and tear at my soul. I try to text her to try to talk to her. She says very mean things. She even blocked me because I was bothering her. I tried to keep fighting even then. The day she gave to ring back to me, she dropped it into my palm like she was letting go of something that was burning her. Finally glad to be rid of something that was causing her so much pain. We talked to my parents because they asked us to and she agreed to a separation with the promise to work on ourselves and slowly try to work on each other.
I was given that same false hope I felt back in the hospital. She later told me that she only agreed out of respect to my parents. That once she walks through the door she’s not turning back. I don’t know if I have any fight left or if I even should. She’s hurt me so much. Said so many things. I want to hate her for everything that’s going on. I want to blame her for anything. But I can’t. I did this. I let it fall apart. As much as people say it was both of us, I just don’t see it.
I love her so much. I want to stop. To be able to turn it off. But no matter what I do I still have this undying raging love for her, my moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to now. My life is really something. I have my birthday coming up in a few days. Turning 22. Yay. I try to look forward to things in the future so I don’t end up looking down the barrel of a gun today.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey gang,

&amp;#x200B;

Obv a throwaway account, dont want to put my mental health out there for the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed bi-polar/Manic Depressive. I began wellbutrin about 5 months ago. About 3 months ago I started taking Lamictal ( a mood stabilizer). You have to ramp up on Lamical, because there is small chance of some nasty side-effects (do not google it. I have warned you)

&amp;#x200B;

So I started on 25mg or 50mg of Lamictal. I ramped up to land at 100mg a day and also a 150mg of Wellbutrin.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a one-hit-chump. One good hit of some concentrate would keep my high for 1/2 the day. The first 20-45 mins I would be ""too high"" until it settled in a bit. I also got the terribly feared anxiety that often comes with cannabis usage.

&amp;#x200B;

Since a regular 100mg a day of Lamictal I can no long get high like I use to. First of all I am dabbing the shit out of concentrate these days. 1 gram of concentrate use to last me weeks if not a couple months. Now I can dab a whole g in a weekend...maybe even a night if I tried. All the while never getting as high as I was. This is not a totally bad effect for me. I like the subtle high I am getting now. My main personal concern is how much more expensive staying medicated is now. I am in a medically legal state in the U.S. and shit is expensiveeee. We have no recreational program yet. so prices stay high. I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a tolerance issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I have googled the hell out of this question and the internet doesnt mention this idea anywhere. i have looked up interactions and side effects. I have searched for peoples specific answers to Lamictal and Cannabis interactions. Most of those accounts say that Cannabis will make you sleepy with Lamictal. that is not my only experience here.

&amp;#x200B;

Im interested in hearing anyone's first or second hand account. Anyone out there taking Lamitcal know WTF I am talking about? Anyone get noticeably less high with a Lamictal script?

&amp;#x200B;

I intend to cross post this in as many cannabis/mental health subreddits as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. - If anyone knows of any other good subreddits that might help me, please do suggest them and I will cross post.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Obv a throwaway account, dont want to put my mental health out there for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been diagnosed bi-polar/Manic Depressive. I began wellbutrin about 5 months ago. About 3 months ago I started taking Lamictal ( a mood stabilizer). You have to ramp up on Lamical, because there is small chance of some nasty side-effects (do not google it. I have warned you)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started on 25mg or 50mg of Lamictal. I ramped up to land at 100mg a day and also a 150mg of Wellbutrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been a one-hit-chump. One good hit of some concentrate would keep my high for 1/2 the day. The first 20-45 mins I would be &amp;quot;too high&amp;quot; until it settled in a bit. I also got the terribly feared anxiety that often comes with cannabis usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a regular 100mg a day of Lamictal I can no long get high like I use to. First of all I am dabbing the shit out of concentrate these days. 1 gram of concentrate use to last me weeks if not a couple months. Now I can dab a whole g in a weekend...maybe even a night if I tried. All the while never getting as high as I was. This is not a totally bad effect for me. I like the subtle high I am getting now.

,depression,"Don’t really know how to shake this shit anymore. I grew up with crazy depression in my teens, shook it off  in my 20’s and it’s been creeping back in my life the last 5-6 years since I’ve moved away from home with my gf (now wife). 

The last 3 years specifically have broken me into more pieces than I care to count. Job opportunity didn’t work out like I had planned which caused my immediate life plans (wife, house, kids)  to change. Tried getting a professional career in the same industry only to get passed over time and time again. Getting passed over by people who were less qualified and experienced, sucked the passion for my career right out of my soul. 

GF broke my heart and I forgave her because of what she told me. Only to find out a year later that even that was a lie and it was more then what it was, after I proposed. I love her to death and would literally do anything on planet earth to make her happy, but the lying hurt so fucking much. Safe to say that shit made me feel inadequate as fuck and caused some extreme paranoia. Lost 2 of our dogs in under a year, lost a house I really liked in a town I really loved. Lost my grandfather who was a best friend to me and couldn’t even be there with him because of fucking covid. Felt sad and guilty I couldn’t see him in the end when I wanted to see him the most. Started my own business which is having some success, but no one really appreciates what I do nor do they understand the work that goes into it. I don’t really care to tell people the toll it puts on me mentally and physically because no one I know really cares, don’t know why they would. I can’t focus on shit and I feel fucking broken and sometimes lifeless. I don’t care to answer text or business emails because I’m so burnt out . If I do it just means more work which means more of a toll. If I don’t, I don’t make money and feel fucking useless. 

My mind, ego, pride and heart have all been broken in under 3 years.  I feel like I have no support and feel like a bitch for feeling this way. I don’t ever put my problems on anyone, I’m usually picking up people and helping them with their issues. Lately, small issues have been causing me to spiral my thoughts and makes me remember the last few years and sink back into a depression. I have more loses in life then I do wins and it kills me. I feel like I’ve lost connections with people over the years because of the career path I choose and the physical distance that’s between me and my old support system. 

Financially, I’m fine now, but with the economy going the way it’s going I fear that could all change. I’ve already lost 3 clients with slim prospects. People want my service, but don’t want to pay me (go figure). I don’t have the energy or the time I want to have to go campaign for more work, but I’m so fucking burnt out I couldn’t do it even if I did. My wife makes good money, but it kills me that I can’t provide the way I want to. She’s put up with following me around chasing my goals that she deserves to have anything and everything she wants. I can’t give it to her right now which makes me not blame her for seeking attention else where. She can’t hustle her ass off, she doesn’t need me. 

There’s a laundry list of other things that would just fuck me up even more if I sat here and typed them out, but I just needed to vent. I don’t have any close friends that know the real me and who have known me before I switched my tone. Im definitely cut from a different cloth then the people that are around me, which makes it hard to connect with anyone for more than 5 minutes if they aren’t paying me to be there. Even my wife wouldn’t really understand who I was before. I don’t even think I could show her or explain it now because I’m feeling old as fuck these days. I feel like a failure in her eyes when I compare myself to the guys that I know and she knows. I don’t blame her if she thought the same. Who the fuck wants to be with someone like me? - shit, I wouldn’t. 

I feel I don’t get the respect I deserve from the people that should be giving it, but they honestly don’t know what I’ve been through.

I left for the military and my kids stayed with my ex. Some really terrible stuff happened to them while I was gone. I came home to sort it all out and it turned into an absolute nightmare. They were removed from my ex’s home and place into state custody until we could figure some things out. Turns out there was a ton of domestic abuse in her home and it came down on my kids and some even worse things happened to them. I spare you the details. There was whole lot of court and the kids end up with me. I am remarried and now have other children as well. I can’t shake the fact that all of this happened. I’m literally dying inside so badly that it’s effecting my marriage. My wife is strong and she has put up with some un godly shit from my ex. Then she has to put up with me who is now just a shell of my former self. I can’t explain to you all in words on how hard this has all been. It’s been 7 years and I’m not longer the happen person I once was. My kids are all safe now and happy and don’t really remember any of the stuff that happened to them and have been in therapy now for years which I attend with them to help them with what they do remember. The things I heard have hurt me more than anything I saw in the military. I can’t shake the description of the things they told me and I don’t think I ever will. I work 40 hour weeks and I’m home three days a week helping with home things and homework and bed and nap times and I know I am extremely lucky to have my children all under one roof now but I cannot trust anyone anymore. I don’t want to go out on couples dates, or be in large groups of people I just hate it. I can’t stand it. My wife’s a social butterfly and I’m just not there mentally anymore. I hurt so bad inside that I can’t even cry anymore. I was told by the girls theripist that I won’t ever be able to speak my about my trauma because it won’t help them at all. If you’ve never sat in room wailing to your wife that all you want to do is see your kids and felt absolutely helpless to be able to help them, you are so lucky. I’m emotionally gone and angry a lot. Never ever violent, just so mad that this happened at all. I have no outlet and have recently reached out to a theripist to speak to because, I am in now way going to hurt myself or anything like that but I need help trying to get over all of this and get my life back. I want to sing with my wife and dance with her in the kitchen and just feel alive again but I just can’t. For fucks sake I want to cry until I fall asleep but I just can’t. I physically can’t bring myself to do it. I hope that none of you Ever have to feel this way and I wish that I could hug you all and tell you that it will all be alright and make it all better for you, even if I can’t make it better for myself.

They were removed from my ex’s home and place into state custody until we could figure some things out. Turns out there was a ton of domestic abuse in her home and it came down on my kids and some even worse things happened to them. I spare you the details. There was whole lot of court and the kids end up with me. I am remarried and now have other children as well. I can’t shake the fact that all of this happened. I’m literally dying inside so badly that it’s effecting my marriage. My wife is strong and she has put up with some un godly shit from my ex. Then she has to put up with me who is now just a shell of my former self. I can’t explain to you all in words on how hard this has all been. It’s been 7 years and I’m not longer the happen person I once was. My kids are all safe now and happy and don’t really remember any of the stuff that happened to them and have been in therapy now for years which I attend with them to help them with what they do remember. The things I heard have hurt me more than anything I saw in the military. I can’t shake the description of the things they told me and I don’t think I ever will. I work 40 hour weeks and I’m home three days a week helping with home things and homework and bed and nap times and I know I am extremely lucky to have my children all under one roof now but I cannot trust anyone anymore. I don’t want to go out on couples dates, or be in large groups of people I just hate it. I can’t stand it. My wife’s a social butterfly and I’m just not there mentally anymore. I hurt so bad inside that I can’t even cry anymore. I was told by the girls theripist that I won’t ever be able to speak my about my trauma because it won’t help them at all. If you’ve never sat in room wailing to your wife that all you want to do is see your kids and felt absolutely helpless to be able to help them, you are so lucky. I’m emotionally gone and angry a lot. Never ever violent, just so mad that this happened at all. I have no outlet and have recently reached out to a theripist to speak to because, I am in now way going to hurt myself or anything like that but I need help trying to get over all of this and get my life back. I want to sing with my wife and dance with her in the kitchen and just feel alive again but I just can’t. For fucks sake I want to cry until I fall asleep but I just can’t. I physically can’t bring myself to do it. I hope that none of you Ever have to feel this way and I wish that I could hug you all and tell you that it will all be alright and make it all better for you, even if I can’t make it better for myself. If you read all of this you are a saint and please excuse any typos. Just a vent. All of my love to all of you going through hell and still able to keep on moving for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This list will start from most important to the least important , some  things are anecdotal and up to you but I will try to be as descriptive as possible so that I don't come off as somebody that just wants to virtue signal or being a know it all asshole

I Get a diagnosis , Nothing worse than not knowing . You start creating scenario's in you head and you are making the problem worse. You are allowed to get a second or third opinion if you don't feel comfortable. Not all Psychiatrist and Psychologist are the same and their methods differ.

II IF you are prescribed medication don't stop using it unless told other wise by your medical professional. You think you are okay on the medication and this gives a false sense of your medical state.  Yet again speak with your medical professional about this and he\\she will give an accurate estimate. Listen to them rather than yourself . Remember you head is not working correctly so why trust it in the first place?

III I understand that some people cant afford medical treatment but don't resent yourself for it . I was in the same boat . IF you can the do it then I recommend doing it but if you cant then you can try some things I am talking about. Medication makes it easier but it's still possible without it, in my opinion. 

IV get that body moving ,  I do it via exercise ,cardio and body weight .I do it for free and from my home . try to do it at least 2-3 times  a week . half an hour at a time but it does not need to be in the traditional way and most importantly it should be something that you more or less enjoy. No use doing something you hate because the idea is to continue doing it.  Exercise will release endorphins that will help . it helped me in any event . 

V Try to cut out junk food and cook your own meals or if you have to buy premade meals try the healthier option at least .  Sugar is basically poison for your liver and can have detrimental affects on your body and by proxy your mental state .  not saying its going to cure you but at least it wont add to your issues . One less problem right ? 

VI recreational drugs don't mix with prescription medication. This can screw you up even more .  I understand why people do it but its not useful and in actual fact it takes you down a spiral. Just try to avoid it if possible.

VII Try to the best of your ability to cut out everything that is toxic in your life.  Some we have a choice , social media , shitty friends and so forth but some is more difficult like family , spouses and your job. That is up to you how you are going to do it .  Not always possible to quit your job and to be honest you are going to have that ,regardless. It does not matter which job but some jobs are worse than others so I do understand.  Personally for me it was social media . I use it very infrequently now and it helped a lot .  Comparing yourself to a fake person or a fake reality will always make you depressed and resentful .  Yes they are lying to you and you are trying to imitate a lie?  not very useful.

VIII Be the best you that you can be .  Unfortunately I only figured it out very late in my life . It almost feels like its too late but I made peace with it and at this stage the only thing I can do is, try .   I am going back to school , don't know if its going to help but its better to try and fail than to not try at all . Some of you may say that I am just wasting my time and statistically I am screwed but you cant say that with 100% certainty .  The rule of probability says that if I stay in my house , statistically nothing will happen , Like a black hole but if I go out and try my odds go up. Yes the odds are low but its better than nothing. Just try your best because then at least you can give life the big middle finger and say I tried mf and that is something nobody can take away from you .

Lastly, You are not alone when you ask yourself ,what is the point of life? This has  been asked since man could think for itself and the answer is , we don't know but that does not mean life is pointless. We create our own reality within the macro one and that is fine.  Give yourself a break and try to follow your gut . Your brain has been programmed and can be deprogrammed .  Read books or watch things that gives you perspective. Popular content is enjoyable but does not really give you perspective. Its like junk food.   Perspective is very important in life and in general .

&lt;p&gt;VIII Be the best you that you can be .  Unfortunately I only figured it out very late in my life . It almost feels like its too late but I made peace with it and at this stage the only thing I can do is, try .   I am going back to school , don&amp;#39;t know if its going to help but its better to try and fail than to not try at all . Some of you may say that I am just wasting my time and statistically I am screwed but you cant say that with 100% certainty .  The rule of probability says that if I stay in my house , statistically nothing will happen , Like a black hole but if I go out and try my odds go up. Yes the odds are low but its better than nothing. Just try your best because then at least you can give life the big middle finger and say I tried mf and that is something nobody can take away from you .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, You are not alone when you ask yourself ,what is the point of life? This has  been asked since man could think for itself and the answer is , we don&amp;#39;t know but that does not mean life is pointless. We create our own reality within the macro one and that is fine.  Give yourself a break and try to follow your gut . Your brain has been programmed and can be deprogrammed .  Read books or watch things that gives you perspective. Popular content is enjoyable but does not really give you perspective. Its like junk food.   Perspective is very important in life and in general .  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a long one and I commend you for reading it if you did and to all I say this.  We are all on a journey and everybody has a different road but nothing is set and you do have a choice so make the best choice for you because in the end you are the only person travelling on your road .&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"hey everybody…i’m not entirely sure where to post so i just decided to put something here. i’ve been feeling really down lately again and just feel so lost and have no clue what i’m supposed to do.

so a little backstory: i got kicked out of my house back in march of 2021, our landlords illegally kicked us out and since then i have moved 6 times. around july my manager said that i could move into her basement w my roommate bc we both had nowhere to go and we were sharing my childhood bedroom at my grandparents w 3 small dogs. me and my manager had so many plans on what to do w the basement to make it more livable and nice and not so depressing bc it was an unfinished basement. but my roommate had decided to just half ass move all our stuff in one day and then after that day gave up on trying to set stuff up. i was working damn near 60 hrs a week working splits trying to save up money to get an apartment or something so i was just exhausted and needed help w cleaning and keeping the basement not looking like a damn pigsty. we started getting into a lot of arguments bc she was so bad at communication and not really helping out w anything. then around october her ex that had ghosted her randomly messaged her again and they started hanging out ALL. THE. TIME. like she was never home anymore and i got stuck having to watch/take care of her 2 dogs and my dog and keep the basement clean and go to work full time. she started not coming home even if she told me she’d be home that night so i’d stay up to let her in bc our door automatically locked and she had lost her key within a week of us living there. i knew that she was staying around her ex a lot, and while i don’t really care about that (even tho she did have a bf that was in jail at the time) i was more annoyed that she wud tell me she’d be home at a certain or she was on her way home but then come 3am she’s still not home. id call her or text her and she wud just leave me on read and then say “oh i forgot”. that went on for about 2 months and she ended up moving out in november. however she didn’t tell me she was moving out when she did, and she slowly was moving stuff over to her friends (not ex bf) place so i wouldn’t notice. i had told her before that the day she moved out is she has to find somewhere for the dogs cuz i was not willing to keep them if she couldn’t take them. the only way that i’d be willing to keep them was if she had already had a place for them to go but they couldn’t have them until a specified date after she herself moved out. i ended up finding out that she completely moved out while i was at work, not from her but from one of my managers. i had worked an entire shift w her and she said not a single word to me. i get home and one of her dogs was still there, so i called her and said that if she was no longer staying she has to come get her dog. when she had left the basement was absolutely disgusting and she refused to help clean it and said that she doesn’t live there anymore. now i got extremely depressed while living in the basement by myself. it was disgusting, i had a shitty job i hated, i was exhausted, and i had no car. i ended up attempting suicide and one of my roommates found my unconscious in the bathroom. i went to the hospital for a week and when i got out my roommates were so mean to me. come to find out that my ex roommate didn’t tell me that one of her dogs had fleas and she saw them before she left. so when i got out of the hospital the basement was INFESTED w them. so i do understand now why they were so upset, we’ll at least one of the roommates anyways.

while i was in the hospital my mom had begged me to move back to iowa (i was living in wisconsin at the time) and had promised me that i would get help. like w a car, getting to appts, getting to a job, help getting my own place. of course while i was in the hospital i had said yes bc i was so desperate for help and didn’t know what else to do. i ended up moving on the first of the yr so hopeful and sure that i was gonna make it. 

now cut too 3 months later and i don’t have a job, i have no way to get to a job even if i applied to one, absolutely no income, and living in my sisters stepmoms house. i have no friends here and no social life at all. my sister had gotten kicked out a week ago and i’m still here. my mom was gonna move me into her place and even tho i wasn’t exactly thrilled about moving there i was gonna do it. but i still wasn’t happy, i just missed all my friends back home and just wanted to go back. but i knew i couldn’t and that it probably wouldn’t help if i did bc i have been moving back and forth between iowa and wisconsin practically my entire life. my childhood best friend knew all this so she had offered me to move to indiana this summer w her, her bf and her almost 2yr old daughter. bc i haven’t seen her in so long and she has been telling me that her relationship was great and she made it seem moving to indiana was a safe and easy option and we just had to get accepted to a place and we could the move. she even told me to talk to my mom and family about it all. so i did, i told my mom the plan, said everything that my best friend was telling me and my mom was upset of course, but she said that it seemed to be a good choice. well literally an hr after telling my best friend that i had just told all my family and everything, she decides to throw a bombshell at me and say it’s not exactly as she made it seem. she’s scared in her relationship and is desperately trying to get out of it and she’s not 100% sure how we’re even going to manage this. i’m pissed bc i just turned down my moms offer to move in, where i would have had access to getting a job and the bus so i could go places and i could then save up to get my own place. and now i’m right back where i was before and idk what to do. it’s embarrassing. and i’m to scared to let my mom know what has just come about cuz it was just yesterday that i was assuring her that i wud be fine. i have no fucking clue what i’m supposed to do and my mental health has already been declining i’m scared what’s gonna happen now.

&lt;p&gt;so a little backstory: i got kicked out of my house back in march of 2021, our landlords illegally kicked us out and since then i have moved 6 times. around july my manager said that i could move into her basement w my roommate bc we both had nowhere to go and we were sharing my childhood bedroom at my grandparents w 3 small dogs. me and my manager had so many plans on what to do w the basement to make it more livable and nice and not so depressing bc it was an unfinished basement. but my roommate had decided to just half ass move all our stuff in one day and then after that day gave up on trying to set stuff up. i was working damn near 60 hrs a week working splits trying to save up money to get an apartment or something so i was just exhausted and needed help w cleaning and keeping the basement not looking like a damn pigsty. we started getting into a lot of arguments bc she was so bad at communication and not really helping out w anything. then around october her ex that had ghosted her randomly messaged her again and they started hanging out ALL. THE. TIME. like she was never home anymore and i got stuck having to watch/take care of her 2 dogs and my dog and keep the basement clean and go to work full time. she started not coming home even if she told me she’d be home that night so i’d stay up to let her in bc our door automatically locked and she had lost her key within a week of us living there. i knew that she was staying around her ex a lot, and while i don’t really care about that (even tho she did have a bf that was in jail at the time) i was more annoyed that she wud tell me she’d be home at a certain or she was on her way home but then come 3am she’s still not home. id call her or text her and she wud just leave me on read and then say “oh i forgot”. that went on for about 2 months and she ended up moving out in november. however she didn’t tell me she was moving out when she did, and she slowly was moving stuff over to her friends (not ex bf) place so i wouldn’t notice. i had told her before that the day she moved out is she has to find somewhere for the dogs cuz i was not willing to keep them if she couldn’t take them. the only way that i’d be willing to keep them was if she had already had a place for them to go but they couldn’t have them until a specified date after she herself moved out. i ended up finding out that she completely moved out while i was at work, not from her but from one of my managers. i had worked an entire shift w her and she said not a single word to me. i get home and one of her dogs was still there, so i called her and said that if she was no longer staying she has to come get her dog. when she had left the basement was absolutely disgusting and she refused to help clean it and said that she doesn’t live there anymore. now i got extremely depressed while living in the basement by myself. it was disgusting, i had a shitty job i hated, i was exhausted, and i had no car. i ended up attempting suicide and one of my roommates found my unconscious in the bathroom. i went to the hospital for a week and when i got out my roommates were so mean to me. come to find out that my ex roommate didn’t tell me that one of her dogs had fleas and she saw them before she left. so when i got out of the hospital the basement was INFESTED w them. so i do understand now why they were so upset, we’ll at least one of the roommates anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while i was in the hospital my mom had begged me to move back to iowa (i was living in wisconsin at the time) and had promised me that i would get help. like w a car, getting to appts, getting to a job, help getting my own place. of course while i was in the hospital i had said yes bc i was so desperate for help and didn’t know what else to do. i ended up moving on the first of the yr so hopeful and sure that i was gonna make it. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
I've been with depression pretty much my whole life. I've hardly felt the other way around. I never had any real friends. Depression, my childhood traumas, loneliness were very normalised with me from the beginning so i never questioned it at all until i had started to have some severe symptoms which interrupted  my daily life and eventually got diagnosed with PTSD, MDD and BPD. The first time i started medication i just felt lost and had a really hard time to understand my emotions. But soon enough i adapted and got into my usual self. Meaning the medication didn’t work. This kept happening everytime i changed medication. But It was a product of my effort. Though it didn’t happen in my conscious mind, it just happened. May be It's my defence mechanism to the sudden change. I'm afraid of changes, the moment I'd feel any changes happening I'd just crawl back to my dark empty cave where i feel the most comfortable. Actually I just feel this void inside me without depression. Depression is like this long known old friend. I'm not me without it. I experience things, feel my existence this way. It's how i feel the blue sky, the clouds, a piece of art or a beautiful object. These depressing melancholic feelings, such feelings of homesickness, I'm not me without these feelings. It has been with me for so long that it has become a part of my sentience. I'm someone else without it.
I just want to feel safe. And It's exhausting. I'm always afraid I'll lose myself. My real self. I'm constantly worried about becoming someone else who isn’t me.

,depression,"My family has a full line of mental illness, so when I started experiencing depression and anxiety as young as 7 years old I assumed it was all genetically bound to me. 

I'm 23... And, it's gone... It's quiet. For the first time in my life...? 

My depression has always been another train of thought. I've always described it like the ""USB symbol"" like there's 3 prongs of logical, normal, and depression just always going in my brain like a tired pessimistic critic of everything. 

I've just learned to ignore it as much as possible. I always listen to podcasts or videos that prevents it from getting louder. The exhaustion was the only thing that actually affected my life. 

But. I was just thinking today, I haven't had that other train of thought in... A little while.. Like it's just, gone. And I think, it's because I'm happy...? 

Sure my life has been stressful but. Was that much of my life in that bad of an environment? Like, I thought I was meant to be like that forever, as far as I can remember I've been like this... What, what the hell? Why is it just, gone???

A lot of things in my life have changed within the last year. I literally dropped everything, was at my lowest, and somehow built myself back up to an even better position than before... 

I'm not even sure that I'm happy. Maybe, peaceful is the best way to word it. Comfortable. And without even realizing, I don't think that train of thought is there anymore... 

Don't get me wrong. I'm still trying to get help for my other mental illnesses. But I think, the suicidal thoughts are gone. And, that's, fucking awesome... 

I really hope that you can find your peace... 
If I can offer advice at all. It's, if you hate your life, don't end it in the way you think you should... if you're ready to give up everything, do it. If you're ready to end your life, demand the best from your job. 
If they deny you a raise, fuck it, you were ready to lose the job anyway. Quit/get fired. 
Hate your romantic partner, get rid of them. You were ready to let go of them with ending your life anyway. 
Family? Respect my boundries or gtfo of my life.
Home life suck? Go somewhere else. Can't afford it? Try crashing somewhere and figure out the long term plan after. 

If you're miserable in your life, let everything go, and try something completely new. The worst that happens, is you're in a shitty situation somewhere else. But you'll never be happy where you are right now.

I left my ex, moved in with parents, demanded more from my job and had my two weeks ready. All because I told myself if I couldnt kms then I would ruin my life another way. And it all worked for the best. 

I got a promotion, which let me meet someone, and we have our own home. Financially I'm not drowning anymore. I'm so, so thankful I quit my life in a different way. 

I guess I'm doing this long message because there's no one in my life that would get this. I was talking to my partner and they said it's good but. I guess I'm in shock that it's not there, but. Also feel like I need to throw a God damn party for this?? Haha. Uh... Thank you, to anyone who reads this. I really hope that this makes some people think that there's a light out there.

,depression,"I don't know if this post is a cry for help or just to write down some thoughts. This post is not about me, its about a very close friend.

I'm gonna start at the beginning. I'm working during the day and my dog is home alone. My dog is not used to being alone for a long time and is barking the whole time. My neighbour (the person this post is about) has a heart for animals and is generally the most kind person I know. She offers to take care of my dog during the day where I'm at work. Since I was searching for a solution I gladly accepted this offer and went on. This was about 2 months ago.

We got closer and closer and I began to spend my whole freetime with her. We both seemed to really enjoy. She began to tell me more about her life and about her depression. I shouldn't give out too much details, but she had several suicide attempts and her whole arm is full of self-harm scars. She also told me that life for her is a constant suffering and that she cannot feel anything but a deep sense of emptiness because of the medication she takes. Her life was basically full of traumatic events (childhood, relationships, anxiety).

I was never depressed and never had a strong urge to kill myself, that's why I didn't knew how to handle the situation. I ended up listening to everything she said, assuring her that I was there for her. (Looking at this afterwards, seems like the best thing I could have done)

The days went by and I did my best to help her as much as I could. At first everything seemed fine and she even seemed to be getting a little better, but recently she found out that one of her ""closest friends"" had been lying to her the whole time.

This was kind of the killing blow. It all went down after that. The last 3 days she wanted to kill herself and I managed to talk her out of it. I really don't know what to do. I have this constant feeling of losing her. She told me that I'm the only person she likes in this world and she tried to explain to me that living with constant fear is not worth living. I can't take this. I can't just let her go like this. Again I'm at the edge of crying by writing this post. The fear of losing her and not being able to do anything against it makes me feel so bad.

I'm enjoying every second I spent with her and all I want is to make her feel better. She doesn't think it will ever get better and why not end it right now. I don't want to alert any authorities or anything, because she needs to decide it for herself, all I can do is tell her how much I love her and that I'm there for her if she needs anything.

My neighbour (the person this post is about) has a heart for animals and is generally the most kind person I know. She offers to take care of my dog during the day where I&amp;#39;m at work. Since I was searching for a solution I gladly accepted this offer and went on. This was about 2 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got closer and closer and I began to spend my whole freetime with her. We both seemed to really enjoy. She began to tell me more about her life and about her depression. I shouldn&amp;#39;t give out too much details, but she had several suicide attempts and her whole arm is full of self-harm scars. She also told me that life for her is a constant suffering and that she cannot feel anything but a deep sense of emptiness because of the medication she takes. Her life was basically full of traumatic events (childhood, relationships, anxiety).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never depressed and never had a strong urge to kill myself, that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t knew how to handle the situation. I ended up listening to everything she said, assuring her that I was there for her. (Looking at this afterwards, seems like the best thing I could have done)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days went by and I did my best to help her as much as I could. At first everything seemed fine and she even seemed to be getting a little better, but recently she found out that one of her &amp;quot;closest friends&amp;quot; had been lying to her the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was kind of the killing blow. It all went down after that. The last 3 days she wanted to kill herself and I managed to talk her out of it. I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I have this constant feeling of losing her. She told me that I&amp;#39;m the only person she likes in this world and she tried to explain to me that living with constant fear is not worth living. I can&amp;#39;t take this. I can&amp;#39;t just let her go like this. Again I&amp;#39;m at the edge of crying by writing this post. The fear of losing her and not being able to do anything against it makes me feel so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m enjoying every second I spent with her and all I want is to make her feel better. She doesn&amp;#39;t think it will ever get better and why not end it right now. I don&amp;#39;t want to alert any authorities or anything, because she needs to decide it for herself, all I can do is tell her how much I love her and that I&amp;#39;m there for her if she needs anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post. I apologize if this post is a bit messy, I was just trying to write down some of my thoughts. I wrote her a message 3 hours ago and she hasn&amp;#39;t answered since. I&amp;#39;m hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi guys, I’m new here and I’m not even sure if I’m in the right place. 

I come from a divorced family and growing up I felt as if I was trying to hold everyone together but ended up getting torn apart. I never saw a psychologist, not because I didn’t want to but because my dad wouldn’t send me to one. I have a lot of trauma and find little things very triggering.

I live with my mom, she is the most wonderful mom you can ask for, but like everyone else in the family she has also been affected by the divorce. I am short tempered like my father, a trait that I absolutely despise, and sometimes I act or say things similar to the comments my by my dad that tormented my mother. Yet I can’t help but to feel as if my dad had a point when feeling or making said comments. Every time this happens, my mom tells me to take life easy and dismisses my feelings, or says that no matter how perfect things are, I find something to complain about.

I feel as if she has weaponized my own feelings against me, I feel as if I can’t talk to her or say anything without feeling like my dad and all the horrible things he said/did. 

I have been getting triggered over the smallest things and it sends me into a state of pure rage and anger. I can feel my heart pump harder, front of my head get warmer, and feel as if something is about to come out from the inside of me. I can’t control these thoughts or calm down the rage and my only solution is to lash out at someone/something.

,depression,"I'm 17 years old and all I do is lay in bed all day and do nothing, and this isn't an exaggeration.

I can't get myself to do anything, watch TV, do homework, read, nothing. All I do is sleep or browse random things on my phone (usually social media). Sometimes, I don't even have motivation to do even that. I'm always so exhausted.

A lot of times I can't get myself to get up to get a drink of water, so I have to keep a water bottle in my room that gets warm often and I don't want to drink it anymore. I'm pretty sure I'm not drinking enough water.

I don't really leave the house since I have virtual school. I hated going to irl school because I was often lonely.

But man, since freshman year (I was still in irl school) my grades started dropping. I used to be an A student with a 3.5 GPA and and honors student, I even rarely got C's. That freshman year I had to drop my honors class with barley a C and I had to have tons of extra help in my math class since I had trouble paying attention. Now I always struggled getting my homework done, but since Freshman year it started to get worse trying to find motivation to get work done.

Flash towards to covid and virtual school. My GPA is now a 2.5. I can barley get a C anymore or pay attention to class. I procrastinate getting my work done. It's not that I'm dumb, just really unmotivated and can't pay attention.

I had a french class, which was one of my favorites. I even got an award for the best french student In my school. Now I failed french class as my only failing class and I got kicked from the class earlier this year for not attending classes or doing my work (which to be fair I didn't actually know I had to attend classes since It was a class in a different school and I didn't know what to do). 

I used to love studying languages, now I can't get myself to do even that.

I also have bad anxiety, social anxiety, and intrusive thoughts, which makes it even more difficult to talk to people.

Now the only times I do anything is getting up to draw, or write. (Struggle doing both)  I have started walking in my backyard a little but I haven't done it in a week or two because my earbuds broke and that put me out of the moodm

I used to preoccupy my time reading books and drawing  all day. Now I can barley do both. I tried to pick up a book the other day but I couldn't find the motivation to finish it (but I did get more than half way through). I do draw every other day but even that I don't do enough of and my art skills are suffering because of it.

There are many books I want to read but I can not find the motivation to start, even the books I start I can't finish (even if they are good). I am currently reading something but haven't picked it up in days. I used to be able to binge read books day after day, what happened?

As far as writing goes, I lack ideas because I don't read enough. Even if I have ideas, I have no motivation to write them.

I've even lost the motivation to play video games or use my laptop.

The only person I talk to is my best friend a bit every day by text. I do not talk to my other friends very often.

My hair looks a mess because I can't get myself or someone else to do it.

Now for those who are wondering, I am getting help. I have started taking to a counselor recently. We are making goals with each other to help me with my issues. I am also visiting a family member tommrow which will be the first time I'm out in a month or two.

I don't take medicine and won't be taking medicine unless it's a last resort.

But man, this past week for spring break has been horrible. I have hardly been out of bed all week

I'm going to bath off and catch up on homework today, maybe walk and draw, possibly read, do my hair. I want to change but man is it fucking hard. I have no motivation to live but I gotta keep going.

Whilst there are people who lose their families, friends, loved ones, jobs, struggle financially, physically, etc.

,depression,"(Sorry for making this another super long post) 


For those who didn’t read Pt. 1. my mom hates my guts and abused tf outta me, and my dad sucks too. But he’s a better choice than my mom. (Kinda) 

I tried to fit everything into part 1. But I left 1 part out. Plus. Some things happened recently which made me realize sum stuff. 

Long story short, I’m in NY visiting for abt a month or 2. My whole life is here. My future is here. And I met an amazing girl that I really like. 

None of that matters cause I’m going back to Florida. Where the only future I have is either milking cows or working at Walmart. 

I used to be addicted to drugs Back when I lived with my mom. I was at my friend’s house with my at the time gf. He gave us ecstasy and told us “it’s a fun drug for couples”. 

But I got hooked on it. It made me forget all my problems. Made me forget the world around me. It allowed me to live in my own universe. 

And I. Was. Hooked. I’d beg him to get me more. I lost friends and my gf because of it. Which made me wanna take more. The high was fucking amazing. 

But the coming down. Holy shit.  It made me wanna kill myself more than I already did. I was addicted for about 5-6 months. 

Until I had a friend help me detox. Molly was the only drug I ever tried. And I never did anything else ever again. 

But my friend wants to hang out Cause I haven’t seen his ass in like 6 years. But he wants to smoke weed together. 

And rn. I’m more depressed than I’ve ever fucking been. Idk if I should. I’m scared I’d get addicted. Ik weed is no where near as bad as Molly. But still. Idk shit abt drugs 

My brother is the perfect son in my dad’s eyes. Married with 2 kids. A good paying job. A big house in a nice neighborhood. And 2 college degrees. 

AND he’s a pastor in a church and is heavily involved multiple days a week. Which is everything my dad ever wanted and more. 

I always knew I wasn’t the favorite. Which never bothered me. I never wanted to be. Im the complete opposite. But damn. 

We went to my brother’s church. And ofc the head pastor of the church just talks positive abt him “he’s been a blessing to the people. The best preacher we have. Blah blah blah” 

And my dad answers “yea. He’s making me proud. I’m proud to call him a son. I love him.” I almost cried right fucking there in front of everybody. 

I haven’t cried in a LONG time. I’ve tried. Nothing makes me cry. But that made a tear fall down my cheek. He never fucking told me he’s proud of me. Never even told me he loves me. 

Whenever he talks abt me to other people. It’s always the negative shit. “He has mental problems. He’s like an animal, he’s brainless, He’s this. He’s that” but whenever it’s one of my brothers. Nothing but positive 

Now don’t get me wrong. I love my brother. He’s one of the few people I look up to and one of the fewer people I trust. 

And I realized. My depression isn’t my situation. It’s my dad. I didn’t realize it till this trip. If I don’t understand something. instead of just telling me what it is. 

He’ll call me a fucking brainless dumbass instead. Versus my brother. He treats me like I’m a human fucking being and explains it. And in general he treats me like I’m a human. My dad just acts like I’m this thing with no brain. 

And when he thinks I can’t hear him. He always says I’m mentally retarded. Ik I do in fact have some problems mentally. But I wouldnt go as far as to say Im Actually diagnostically retarded. 

My thing is. Im slower than most. Some take seconds to realize something (common sense) it takes me longer. Then I’ll be like ohhhhh. Duh. Or I don’t always understand what your telling me. 

But I don’t think that’s so bad to the point where I need to be in Sped classes with the kids who can’t even talk and still wear diapers like my dad says I am. 

But Ik Im the problem. Like my existence, not my mental problems. He left Me and my mom when I was 3 to live his life in Florida. He got married and everything. 

Good for him. I don’t give a shit. But after all the shit with my mom. I move in with him. I literally just showed up Into they’re lives. 

My stepsister moved out like 2 months after I moved in cause of me. My stepmom doesn’t like me. She tolerates me because she has to. But hates it. 

And I tell him shit all the time. And he either ignores me completely. Or on the off chance he hears me. Hell say that idk shit. Then boom. I was right. But he won’t even say “damn son. You was right” either. 

Most of his problems and struggles are caused by him. He fucks himself over. I’ve been telling him for YEARS. And he just says that I’m talking disrespectfully to him and I got an attitude. 

But my brother says the same exact shit I say. Word for word. Same tone. Exactly the same. Sometimes worse. My “attitude” is physical. Like I’ll wave my arms around as I talk to him. 

My brother is verbal. Mf will yell it at you (not in a disrespectful way) and say stuff like “ITS COMMON SENSE. USE YOUR LOGIC”

 and my dad just says “Damn son. You’re right. Imma change my life around. Thanks son. I wish someone told me before” 

And he’s also one of those parents. If he gets ME a PS4 for Christmas. Mf will say that it’s his PS4 cause he paid for it with his money. He said that abt an iPad he GIFTED me. A gift. As in “here. This is YOURS to keep” 

He went into it and completely changed my shit. Got rid of half of my shit. And added some random shit I don’t need or use. without asking. He just fucking grabbed it and did it. 

And when I tell him abt it. He said “it’s my iPad I can do whatever” so I factory reseted it and within the hour it was in his hands. 

Ig he realized that he was a fucking cunt abt it cause he was giving it back to me saying he’s sorry. I basically told him to fuck off and keep it. I don’t want it anymore. If you want to be this way. That’s fine. 

When i get a job. I’ll save up and replace all my shit. Will I be wasting a shit ton of money to buy shit I already have? Yes. Is that me being super fucking petty? Also yes. But it’s worth it. 

I’ll be able to call it mine cause I worked my ass off for it. 1000% mine. Im giving him everything. “His” videogames, “his” phone, “his” room, “his” bed “his” clothes. everything. Fuck him. I’m moving out the SECOND I get the chance. 

Speaking of moving out. apparently he wrote in his will that if he were to die. I go move in with my brother. And idk if it’s bad to say this. But kinda want it to happen. 

I’m not wishing death on him. That’s a bit much. (Kinda) But i wouldn’t want anything more in the world. Than to live with my brother. 

He’s married with 3 kids. 2 toddlers and a teenager. The wife and teen don’t do Shit. The wife works from home and she has her own social media business thing. 

But other than that. She don’t do Shit. And if they both sitting down on the couch watching tv. My brother is the one 1000% of the time. Getting up to take care of the kids. 

The teen just goes to school, come home, and lock herself in her room. Occasionally she’ll hang out with my brother. Just him and her. 

He’s working 3 Jobs. He does his main 9-5 monday-friday. Then he has church 3 days a week. Then he has a job Saturdays from the morning till like 2. 

And on top of that. He’s the only one taking care of the kids. Plus doing errands. Plus buying the food for dinner. Plus this plus that. I already have everything planned out. 

The church he works at has a super serious drama program. Some people involved eventually made it to broadway. I wanna be an actor. 

We were talking abt it the other day. Abt college and what I wanna be n shii. I told him I want to be involved in film/theater some how but my preference is acting. He immediately goes 

“wow. That great. That’s a really good choice. Damn. If you still lived out here I could’ve hooked you up to the plays we have here” which broke my fucking heart. 

MY BROTHER. WHO I BARELY SEE. supports me more than my own fucking father. He says that whatever I “pick” he doesn’t give a fuck. 

Cause eventually imma fail at what I want to do and I’m just gonna “follow my calling” and become a pastor. Or better yet. Be a pastor at his church 😐

Not everything is abt being a fucking pastor or doing your fucking homework. But anyways. Back to my brother 

So my plan would be to just help out. I’d help him with the girls. They fucking love me. I’d help clean up around the house. Do the dishes. Laundry. Etc etc. 

Just make his life easier. I’d also get involved in the church. Again. To help him out. I’d be his armor bearer which is churchtalk for assistant. 

Id get a job and whatever I’d made 50-50. I don’t have any bills or anything. But I’m an extra mouth to feed. So let that 50 be rent or sumthin. Idk. 

Ik It sounds like fantasy land or sumthin. Like living with him is rainbow and sunshines. Which is not. It comes with its own set of rules and shit. But we understand eachother. 

And the “negatives” of living with him aren’t that bad. Most of it would be work related stuff which I’m good at. Sweep and mop, do laundry, etc etc. And babysit the kids. No problem with none of that 

My dad always refers to us to other people as “the boys &amp; Isaiah” or “my sons and Isaiah” (I’m Isaiah) why am I separate? 

It’s because I’m not going to college and I got bad grades and I’m not involved in church. Vs them. Who all had all A’s, multiple degrees, and in church. 

he just wants me to join a fucking church. It’s all this nigga ever fucking talks about. School and church. There’s more to fucking life than school and church. Fuck. 

And imma try not to make this a series or anything either. This sad Just some stuff I didn’t put into part 1. I think I’ve said everything so far. Idk. Just FML",t2_67xbbqzg,False,,0,False,I Wish I Never Existed Pt. 2,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tndl5m,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648180959.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sorry for making this another super long post) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who didn’t read Pt. 1. my mom hates my guts and abused tf outta me, and my dad sucks too. But he’s a better choice than my mom. (Kinda) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to fit everything into part 1. But I left 1 part out. Plus. Some things happened recently which made me realize sum stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I’m in NY visiting for abt a month or 2. My whole life is here. My future is here. And I met an amazing girl that I really like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that matters cause I’m going back to Florida. Where the only future I have is either milking cows or working at Walmart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be addicted to drugs Back when I lived with my mom. I was at my friend’s house with my at the time gf. He gave us ecstasy and told us “it’s a fun drug for couples”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got hooked on it. It made me forget all my problems. Made me forget the world around me. It allowed me to live in my own universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I. Was. Hooked. I’d beg him to get me more. I lost friends and my gf because of it. Which made me wanna take more. The high was fucking amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the coming down. Holy shit.  It made me wanna kill myself more than I already did. I was addicted for about 5-6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I had a friend help me detox. Molly was the only drug I ever tried. And I never did anything else ever again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my friend wants to hang out Cause I haven’t seen his ass in like 6 years. But he wants to smoke weed together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rn. I’m more depressed than I’ve ever fucking been. Idk if I should. I’m scared I’d get addicted. Ik weed is no where near as bad as Molly. But still. Idk shit abt drugs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother is the perfect son in my dad’s eyes. Married with 2 kids. A good paying job. A big house in a nice neighborhood. And 2 college degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND he’s a pastor in a church and is heavily involved multiple days a week. Which is everything my dad ever wanted and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always knew I wasn’t the favorite. Which never bothered me. I never wanted to be. Im the complete opposite. But damn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to my brother’s church. And ofc the head pastor of the church just talks positive abt him “he’s been a blessing to the people. The best preacher we have. Blah blah blah” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my dad answers “yea. He’s making me proud. I’m proud to call him a son. I love him.” I almost cried right fucking there in front of everybody. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t cried in a LONG time. I’ve tried. Nothing makes me cry. But that made a tear fall down my cheek. He never fucking told me he’s proud of me. Never even told me he loves me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever he talks abt me to other people. It’s always the negative shit. “He has mental problems. He’s like an animal, he’s brainless, He’s this. He’s that” but whenever it’s one of my brothers. Nothing but positive &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong. I love my brother. He’s one of the few people I look up to and one of the fewer people I trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I realized. My depression isn’t my situation. It’s my dad. I didn’t realize it till this trip. If I don’t understand something. instead of just telling me what it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’ll call me a fucking brainless dumbass instead. Versus my brother. He treats me like I’m a human fucking being and explains it. And in general he treats me like I’m a human. My dad just acts like I’m this thing with no brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when he thinks I can’t hear him. He always says I’m mentally retarded. Ik I do in fact have some problems mentally. But I wouldnt go as far as to say Im Actually diagnostically retarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thing is. Im slower than most. Some take seconds to realize something (common sense) it takes me longer. Then I’ll be like ohhhhh. Duh. Or I don’t always understand what your telling me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think that’s so bad to the point where I need to be in Sped classes with the kids who can’t even talk and still wear diapers like my dad says I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ik Im the problem. Like my existence, not my mental problems. He left Me and my mom when I was 3 to live his life in Florida. He got married and everything. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I use to live a happy social lifestyle, I didn’t have to act to fit in, it was just my nature. 

Drugs are something I would never have sort out but my friends all did them and I just went along with it.

Guess I had a predisposition to them because after only a couple party pills my brain chemistry was permanently altered.

My ability to read emotions is gone. I cant just relax and be myself around people anymore because I don’t understand them. I cant read social cues anymore and I get bad anxiety.

If I were to force myself to be a bit goofy and make someone laugh like i did effortlessly in the past I’m sure i would panic, my face would twitch (a common reaction in people with bad anxiety) and looking them in the eyes would feel like an electrical shock so naturally I would look down at my feet. 

So now I’m an awkward introvert with creeping depression.

The point I’m trying to make is that, depression is just bad brain chemistry. If your brain was healthy you would be happy and life would feel like a wonderful gift.

My understanding of depression is that something went wrong, it might have been a physical or psychological change  but your brain couldn’t handle it and depression was the result.

If you have struggled with depression your whole life theres a good chance you were born with bad chemistry or perhaps your parents did drugs during your conception. Maybe your parents were abusive and your brain had to put walls up and shut off.

For a lot of us there is no cure, theres just live with it as best you can. We cant get a new brain or become a child again and soak up social behaviour until we become extroverted. 

For some there is hope, maybe your brain will give you another chance and I hope it does.

,depression,"Hi y’all I’m just gonna rant about “some” stuff that I’ve been keeping to myself for the last 15 ish years. Reason? I don’t know. Maybe pity or maybe because I feel like I’m about to become a psychopath. I don’t know really. 

My whole life, since the minute I was born was based on expectations and reputation. 

I had to sit straight, smile, not laugh, be polite, eat right, can’t make my own life decisions, learn calligraphy, be at the top of my classes, respect my enemies, discard my feelings, can’t be ugly, can’t be too skinny or too fat, can’t have a single mark on my face, be pretty else no one would dare like me, my favorite color had to be blue, certain meals I must love. I had to be a doll. 

Everything I ever did had to be calculated. Everyone has to believe that I am society’s perfect little doll. But my one flaw was that I am a damn human. I have feelings. And it always got in the way of everything. 

I craved my father’s love. I so desperately wanted it. I wanted him to look at me for once in his life and say “I love you” or “You’re doing great.” Is it that hard? 

But I’ve never gotten that. He’d say it to my cousins, he’d kiss their forehead every morning he’d tell them that they are a piece of his heart. When they failed their tests he’d give them money it but presents and tell them that at least they tried.  

He even thought them how to ride a bike! Like can you image that?! A god damn bike! And I have never learned. 

But I, his blood born daughter got nothing of the sort. If I got anything below a 100 I’d get punished. I’d get burned or slapped, or I’d starve. I was told that I’m a failure an abomination. And he never took me out anywhere. I’d be stuck home while he’d take my cousins to Disneyland or some zoo. 

Anyway, when I finally did bring that 100, nothing happened. I didn’t get a kiss on the forehead, I didn’t get a pat on the back, I didn’t get a smile. I didn’t get anything. I got a “Let’s see if you can keep the 100 for next time or will you just be a disgrace to your family.” I tried. I swear I tried. I worked my butt off. I studied I rewrote tests answers and questions I rewrote passages from our homework over and over until I could memorize every line. I did whatever I could think off to make sure I got that 100. But nothing ever satisfied him. 

My dear mother, the women who I am told I am indebted to only reminded me how she sacrificed her life for me so I’ve ought to pay her back in double. I don’t even know how I could even do just that. 

My younger brother, who never do bats an eye at me, who never cares about me, I swear I tried to mend our relationship several times for 6.5 years. But nothing ever worked. I don’t know what I did wrong. But he loathes me. 

Over the years if my life I made several attempts to make friends, each and every single one of them treated me like the sole of their shoe, they’d either beat the hell out of me or they’d literally try to murder me. So I’ve given up on that. 

Obviously I’m not meant to please anyone. 

I don’t know, really I don’t know anything. All I know that there is clearly something wrong with me. Something seriously wrong with me because if there wasn’t my father wouldn’t loathe me and treat me differently than everyone including my brother, my mother wouldn’t be the way she is and my brother wouldn’t be so damn distant from me all the time even tho we r literally under the same roof.

,depression,"i've slowly lost most of my friends in the last 2 years and i'm so isolated and lonely 

i've never had a partner which doesn't usually bug me since i've never cared about that kind of thing but lately it's got me thinking something is wrong with me cause by my age almost everyone is with someone/has been with at least 1 person and i can't even imagine how amazing it feels to have someone who loves you truly and you love back like i can't even imagine what that feels like

i feel like something is wrong with me every friendship i have lately i feel like i'm closer with the person then they do me

there's been so many times i've thought of how much someone's friendship means to me only to realize they barely even think of my existence and we slowly drift apart and i end up feeling they hate me (which isn't true they just don't think about me anymore) how do people just forget others i wish i could do that i think about people from my past so much

i do get we all have our own busy adult lives and our own demons to deal with but it just hurts going through life feeling like i always like people more than they like me

i play video games alone most of the time now and it makes me feel so empty i miss playing with friends. i used to do fun things with friends but now i spend all my time not at work alone in my room with my dog

i feel like i'm invisible and if i was to die tonight no ones lives would be effected much i'm such an invisible existence that brings nothing to the table

i'm so empty and replaceable and don't even have a close group of friends anymore i miss having that so much but they moved on and found new friends and partners and sometimes i'm mad about it and say good riddance and sometimes i'm just sad and feel like i could have done more to stay friends instead of pushing them away the second i felt they didn't care about me anymore

recently one reached out saying they missed me but when i tried making plans they flaked out so i don't understand why people give you empty words when they never plan on actually following through on it? what is the point of getting someones hopes up

i just wanna know is this how adult life is always going to be like? i'm 25 now and feel like the older you get the harder it is to make friends so how the heck am i ever going to make good friends again and how the heck do people cope with being this lonely? i know i'm not the only one so i wish all us lonely ppl could be friends i wish i could be there for anyone feeling the same way, no one deserves to feel this alone and empty inside i wish we could all be happy and have support",t2_9beoq5z1,False,,0,False,giving more emotion than you receive,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tnclur,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648177508.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;ve slowly lost most of my friends in the last 2 years and i&amp;#39;m so isolated and lonely &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;ve never had a partner which doesn&amp;#39;t usually bug me since i&amp;#39;ve never cared about that kind of thing but lately it&amp;#39;s got me thinking something is wrong with me cause by my age almost everyone is with someone/has been with at least 1 person and i can&amp;#39;t even imagine how amazing it feels to have someone who loves you truly and you love back like i can&amp;#39;t even imagine what that feels like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel like something is wrong with me every friendship i have lately i feel like i&amp;#39;m closer with the person then they do me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#39;s been so many times i&amp;#39;ve thought of how much someone&amp;#39;s friendship means to me only to realize they barely even think of my existence and we slowly drift apart and i end up feeling they hate me (which isn&amp;#39;t true they just don&amp;#39;t think about me anymore) how do people just forget others i wish i could do that i think about people from my past so much&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i do get we all have our own busy adult lives and our own demons to deal with but it just hurts going through life feeling like i always like people more than they like me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i play video games alone most of the time now and it makes me feel so empty i miss playing with friends. i used to do fun things with friends but now i spend all my time not at work alone in my room with my dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel like i&amp;#39;m invisible and if i was to die tonight no ones lives would be effected much i&amp;#39;m such an invisible existence that brings nothing to the table&lt;/p&gt;

Now it&amp;#39;s a mess, where there are only some Nazis, homophobes and eccentrics. But not all really. I can find good people. But I only found one. I just don&amp;#39;t have the strength to keep looking. I gave up. I can only imagine that my former world is being swallowed up by some kind of darkness. This is the only thing I can imagine when I think about this website and first of all about the Russians. I feel that there is simply no way out of this horror. I can just try to help the Ukrainian people. I really want to. But how...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what is life without extra pain? To top off my horrid mental state, my mother went in for chemo this Tuesday. She was fine for two days after the first treatment. Now, she&amp;#39;s nauseous and lethargic. I didn&amp;#39;t think it would be this bad. Honestly, it&amp;#39;s worrying me to the point where I have trouble sleeping. I don&amp;#39;t know how long I can take this. It feels like I&amp;#39;m just a push away from falling over the edge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way I can cope with all this? Because right now, I feel like I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello this is my first reddit post. A little background, I'm 21 year old male who has had bouts of suffering with depression since puberty. However lately things had been going very well for me. I graduated college, started my career, making strong gains in the gym, and even recently went on a couple dates with a beautiful young woman.

That was until I was hit by a car a week and a half ago. I won't tell the whole story because it's not really relevant but now all those things I worked for are sinking away. My body, although my injuries are recoverable, is wrecked and all my time in the gym seems for naught. Although I haven't been fired from my job yet my bosses have been difficult and clearly despise me for not being there. I told this girl what had happened to me and although initially sympathetic, immediately those messages dried up like the Sahara, and I'm sure she's already talking to another guy.

A little background, I&amp;#39;m 21 year old male who has had bouts of suffering with depression since puberty. However lately things had been going very well for me. I graduated college, started my career, making strong gains in the gym, and even recently went on a couple dates with a beautiful young woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was until I was hit by a car a week and a half ago. I won&amp;#39;t tell the whole story because it&amp;#39;s not really relevant but now all those things I worked for are sinking away. My body, although my injuries are recoverable, is wrecked and all my time in the gym seems for naught. Although I haven&amp;#39;t been fired from my job yet my bosses have been difficult and clearly despise me for not being there. I told this girl what had happened to me and although initially sympathetic, immediately those messages dried up like the Sahara, and I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s already talking to another guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess besides the depressing rant I&amp;#39;m wondering how do I somehow prevent my mental health from falling into an abyss that I already feel is approaching.

I survived a horrific upbringing that has left me traumatized. I’m very lucky that I made it past age 18 and wasn’t killed, but sometimes I wish I would’ve died anyways so I wouldn’t have to live with the pain that they caused me. Since I came out of that horrible situation, I was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder that impacts my every move. 

I don’t know a single person who can even remotely relate to what I suffered. The only people who can relate are people who are victims of horrible true crime stories that you see on the news. So I’m living my daily life with this burden that no one can connect with. 

I don’t *want* a single person to relate to what I suffered. No human should have to go through what I was put through. But what’s hurtful is that no one even wants to hear my story. 

I’ve tried talking to ‘friends’ about what I went through. I put ‘friends’ in quotes because I don’t have too many people in my life who actually act like friends. Hearing my story was so upsetting to them that they cut me off and refused to let me finish what I was trying to share. This has happened multiple times. On one occasion, it even turned into *me* comforting *them* because they were so upset by my story. 

It’s terrifying for me to share my story, and when ‘friends’ do this to me, I don’t feel supported. 

This is going to sound selfish but I don’t care and I’m gonna say it anyways. If anyone out there is reading this, don’t shame me for what I’m about to say: I *deserve* to have my story told and heard. If I had to suffer through it, and you consider me a true ‘friend’ then you have to suffer through hearing it. I know it’s not easy to know that someone you care about was nearly killed. But I shouldn’t have to carry this weight by myself. 

I’ve been able to share *some* of my story with *some* people in my life (friends and family), but I haven’t been able to share the full extent of my story with anyone because I don’t feel like my story is welcome or that people want to hear it. The only people on earth who know the full extent of what I suffered are myself and the two people who put me through it.

,depression,"I understand there are many great things about life, i'm not some super edgelord that can only see the bad, there's great food, there's great music, there's great people and so on...

But for every good thing in this life, there's like 5 bad things + 4 horrible things + 1 absolutely terrible thing.

Maybe it's just my depression making me focus on the bad, but even ignoring the emotional and just trying to see it from a logical perspective, existence seems like an objectively bad thing and the people that say they are happy on an existential level are either ignorant of how bad it is or they've learned how to trick themselves into thinking it's good, at least that's the only way i can get my head around it.

If this is really it, then please somebody teach me how to do it, because the feeling i get is that this was some secret lesson that a lot of people got from their parents or school, and i was just never exposed to it.

I haven't finished high school, never had a job or girlfriend, I'm overweight and no matter how much I try I can't lose weight. And now I have no appetite most of the time and have no desire to eat, the only reason I eat is because my dad makes dinner and I don't want to alarm him.

I suffer from depression, agoraphobia or whatever it's called and selective mutism, and I realize this is how my entire life will be because I'm too scared to do anything.

I've really tried to fight it but it's impossible, I told myself whenever I felt like shit to fight back but it doesn't work, it really doesn't so I don't want to hear it.

The only friend I have is getting married, he's younger than me, and here I am having done literally nothing with my life, obviously I want to feel happy for him but I can't feel happy about anything. I don't care what any ""professional"" has to say about getting better or how many psychologists tell me this or that, to not focus on my thoughts and so on. I've had so many psychologists but they all just give up in the end. 

I escape into my fanfiction writing, that's really the only time I can feel some fake version of ""happiness"", I've done this since I was about 11-12.

I've thought of overdosing on my anxiety medicine, but I'm a fucking coward and it will probably be slow and painful but I'm kind of used to that by now because I always have this feeling of getting crushed.

I don't know what I'm asking for, why I write this embarrassing rant-thing. Friends, hugs? I don't know if I even deserve friends because I've been so horrible to past friends and they've all left me except for this one guy that keeps putting up with me. Idk I'm just rambling at this point.

,depression,"34f, first time posting, long time struggler with depression.

I've been fully medicated for well over 8 or 9 years now and occasionally therapy, although I've never been good about following up with it. Changed meds several times and have always been compliant about medication.

I moved back to my home state after being gone since i was 19. I basically ran away and chased after boys to find love, acceptance and my place I felt I could be comfortable with and loved. I never really found that place, so I came back.

I feel like my depression has gotten far worse since moving back. I went from being completely independent with lots of friends, good job and great apartment..
 to having to live in my brother's basement apartment, not eating, and smoking weed all day to kill the boredom of my WFH job. I've never done the type of work I do now. It's been so incredibly damaging to my mental health.I know I can just get a new job, but I don't have any motivation to better my life. I don't feel like I have purpse. 

I have made 1 genuine friend recently and that has been helpful and helped with my loneliness. But we all know that friends can only provide a certain level of comfort, because that's all they are able to do. This isn't a complaint, just confirming.

I'm so incredibly lonely and struggle with feeling valid. I crave to have someone care about me and just wants to spend quality time with me. I'm tired of being put last or not even considered. Maybe I'm not ready or those I'm pursuing aren't available.. but I fall for it everytime. It's like an addiction to find someone to spend time with me and hold my hand. I wad also scammed over Christmas from all my savings to a man pretending to be someone else who promised romance and financial security(which wasnt much, but it was all i had).. I haven't even gotten close to recovering from that, either.. both emotionally and financially. It sounds like I'm just desperate for love and i hate that impulse.

I've been struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts. I don't plan on acting on them, but I think about jumping off a cliff near the beach all the time. There are times I will walk a little closer than I should when taking a walk near the water.. just to see what I would do or what might happen. I've never really had such intense thoughts and it's bothersome. The only reason I am not acting on it is I would feel guilty making others feel bad.

I'm defeated and so tired. I'm missing work and not focusing.

&lt;p&gt;I have made 1 genuine friend recently and that has been helpful and helped with my loneliness. But we all know that friends can only provide a certain level of comfort, because that&amp;#39;s all they are able to do. This isn&amp;#39;t a complaint, just confirming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so incredibly lonely and struggle with feeling valid. I crave to have someone care about me and just wants to spend quality time with me. I&amp;#39;m tired of being put last or not even considered. Maybe I&amp;#39;m not ready or those I&amp;#39;m pursuing aren&amp;#39;t available.. but I fall for it everytime. It&amp;#39;s like an addiction to find someone to spend time with me and hold my hand. I wad also scammed over Christmas from all my savings to a man pretending to be someone else who promised romance and financial security(which wasnt much, but it was all i had).. I haven&amp;#39;t even gotten close to recovering from that, either.. both emotionally and financially. It sounds like I&amp;#39;m just desperate for love and i hate that impulse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts. I don&amp;#39;t plan on acting on them, but I think about jumping off a cliff near the beach all the time. There are times I will walk a little closer than I should when taking a walk near the water.. just to see what I would do or what might happen. I&amp;#39;ve never really had such intense thoughts and it&amp;#39;s bothersome. The only reason I am not acting on it is I would feel guilty making others feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m defeated and so tired. I&amp;#39;m missing work and not focusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm new to this subreddit but wanted to pop in here... I think ultimately to feel less alone in my experience.

I was on a really good stint of doing things and was feeling good.

And then I got sick. Well, it was like a series of little things, and then the last week I've been sick.

All in all, I've been pretty dang bed ridden the last two weeks.

And I find I start to slip. Everything starts to feel bad. Everything feels hard.

I start to wonder if I'm sliding back. How much is in my head, maybe I should just shake it off?
But I'm actually sick.. haha

I'm on the mend now, and have therapy today, but wanted to see if being sick does the same for anyone else

,depression,"  

So yesterday (3/23/22) I was at tennis practice in my school’s gym, one of the coaches come in and says that we cannot have practice today because the water is not working (like the water was shutoff its not running) so it was 3:30 the regular bus leaves at 3:30 normally after tennis I ride my schools activity bus which left at 5:45. To give you some context I do not have a phone, so I thought “okay I can’t have tennis practice so I’ll just go to study hall and ride the activity bus like I would normally” so that’s what I did I got home at 6pm to find my mom yelling at me saying things how I should have rode the regular bus and that I had time and I was trying to outsmart her. She added a few more aggressive words in there like calling me the b word and saying how I’m f-ing stupid. Now I’ve always wondered if it was normal for parents to cuss out their kids or if she was verbally abusing me, but anyway she told that me that the whole school needed to be shut down and that I was stupid for staying and riding the activity bus. After that I went to my room and cried (like ugly ugly cried) and was hyperventilating. But whenever my mom is mad at me she always calls her friends and tells them how bad of a kid I am… but im getting of topic more importantly im so so so so so confused why she expected me to ride the regular bus and how I should of contacted her, but I don’t understand how I should of called her.

,depression,"for backstory: 

I've had depressive symptoms for several years that come in waves. I struggle with most of depressions symptoms. I'm diagnosed with OCD. I have social anxiety. 

I've always been a pretty decent student and force myself to get all my work done (I'm in highschool) to the point where I push down all emotion and shut down to do what I have to do. 

My parents are supportive through this rough mental health journey although sometimes they get a little impatient with my recovery...

Recently I've hit a burn out point which leaves me sulking, sleeping more, loss of appetite, not attending school and avoiding anxiety inducing situations etc.. I'm usually very good at hiding my symptoms and I'm usually very bubbly and try my best to people please. 

so here is why I'm here. My parents want me to have friends and go to school etc. Thing is, Ive been going to an alternative school for the past 2 years and it has been going well where I have made friends etc. So yes I've been around people my age and teachers. I even 
met my current boyfriend there. 

Recently, I switched to another alternative school, which I didn't want to happen but anyway, and I'm really struggling to start there. Change is awful so uhm haha. 
My parents don't like this at all ofc. I barely go to school and if I do it's like one hour. I'm supposed to graduate high school this June but with how things are going.. Anyway so bringing back my lovely boyfriend, I hang out with him regularly and even if it's stress inducing to walk to his house and take public transit, I do it. I always have a good time with him and he's one of the few things i look forward to. My parents don't like this bahahah. They think ""where does all that energy go?? Why don't you put that energy into going to school???"" I always reply that its different, seeing him is nice and is worth the stress and yes I want to finish school but it's 
way more difficult, especially a new environment. 

Maybe they're right. What am I doing. But I guess I just wish they'd notice how much progress with my social anxiety this is. I mean going alone on public transit and walking for that long is so amazing for me like I'm proud of myself and no one recognizes that. 

I'm always asked for more and I'm just tired and now I'm judt questioning if I shouldn't hang out with my boyfriend as much and level it out but that won't change anything like ?!?! 

anyway thank you for reading this if you do...

this is me trying

,depression,"Without going into detail, I've tried almost all medical treatments and have been suffering with bipolar depression, social anxiety, bunch of stuff for over a decade. I gave up years ago but continue going through the motions for family. I've frequently bailed on appointments with psychologists and social workers though, to the point where I'm wasting both mine and their time. Because I know I don't believe I'll get better and don't want to anymore. I just try to force myself to co operate because the alternative is death.

,depression,"If you’re depressed, are the feelings there ALL the time, or do they come and go over the course of day or week?

I (30F) first fell into depression very abruptly in 4th grade, like someone flipped a switch.  After reaching a suicidal low point in high school, I upgraded to a “life isn’t great, but I don’t want to die” state.  I figured I was “cured” of depression and this is just how I am, with a low-grade constantly simmering sense of ennui that I could (usually) push to the sides.

Lately the ennui has bloomed into a deep, crushing existential dread.  I’m overall low energy and have lost interest in most everything, but for 70% of the day, it’s bearable and I can go about things normally (although, due to lack of interest, have begged off all activities other than work).  But I’m functional.  I am just blah.  Sometimes I can feel satisfied; today I felt pretty good this morning.  But then the other 30% of the day, I get hit by an all-consuming sense of hopelessness and cannot stop crying.  One minor thing will trigger it and it becomes a tsunami.  The existential dread becomes so terrible, I can almost feel it weighing on my chest, a lump in my throat that feels impossibly stuck.

I’ve just always assumed depression was where you felt terrible, all the time—if I were truly depressed, shouldn’t that weight hang heavy all the time?  Or is the blah-deep despair-blah wave riding typical?

I didn’t say a word to anyone except me talking to myself. I’m too afraid to do anything because I see all these fit guys and good looking people, thinking they’ll judge me.

,depression,"My young nephew came by today and asked if I wanted to go swimming with him. They often go swimming, and always ask me. I told him no, I didn’t really feel like it today. I say yes maybe one in ten times. I have a good time when I’m with them, but I never want to go, even when I say yes. I don’t want to go, but I want to want to go. It’s like that with everything. I don’t want to, but I want to want to.

I’ve lived a long life already. I’m turning thirty soon. But looking back at my life, I’ve done nothing worth mentioning. I haven’t really lived, at all, and life has just passed me by. I’ve been misserable at times, and sometimes I’ve been doing okay, but mostly I’ve just been numb in a way. I don’t think I’ve ever really been okay – even at the times when I feel okay.

My childhood was good. Probably my only good chapter in life, thus far. Things turned sour as a teenager, but I still managed to get through school, although poorly, and eventually got a job somehow. I worked for several years, but life weighed down on me, and it got harder and harder. I struggled focusing and procastinated things till the point I could no longer do my job properly. I quit. I initially planned a to off myself, my go-to plan in life in case things turned too sour, but I never did.

I’ve tried so many times to turn things around, but nothing has stuck. I feel unable to change anything. I’ve tried so many things, read so many guides and advice, gotten hopeful and really tried my best, but I’ve always just returned to my usual state of mind and way of life. I’m in an eternal rut.

I’ve been unemployed for years now. I pretty much just gave up and laid down to rot away. The way back – the mountain ahead of me, it’s just too massive. But even if I manage to start climbing, I’ll just be as miserable as I was before. I don’t know. I feel like I’m damaged goods, unable to change anything about myself. I think the depression that has been a part of me has changed me permanently at this point.

The apathy is the worst. And the procastination and lack of focus. I feel unable to do anything at all. Zero motivation, and worse, zero discipline. I wish I could do things. I wish I had goals and worked torwards those goals. I wish I could focus and read books, clean up, make things, finish projects, etc. Just anything. I don't feel like picking up the spoon to eat my dinner most days.

I’ve never seeked help. I’ve never been on medication. I feel like a fraud thinking I need help. I’ve just been drifting along in limbo, feeling numb, and letting life fly me by. I need to make a real effort, I need to really try, something, anything. What should I do to?

My biggest fear is that, if I eventually figure it out somehow, is that the thought of me already being so old, the thought of it being way too late, will haunt me and drag me back down. If I find the cure, I will hate myself for not finding it 5, 10 or 15 years ago.

It sounds worse than it is, I think. I don’t feel good writing this, but I’m not always miserable. I’m okay, and I have good days. I just wish I was happier more often, or happy for real, I suppose. I need to change and live life.

I have a good time when I’m with them, but I never want to go, even when I say yes. I don’t want to go, but I want to want to go. It’s like that with everything. I don’t want to, but I want to want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lived a long life already. I’m turning thirty soon. But looking back at my life, I’ve done nothing worth mentioning. I haven’t really lived, at all, and life has just passed me by. I’ve been misserable at times, and sometimes I’ve been doing okay, but mostly I’ve just been numb in a way. I don’t think I’ve ever really been okay – even at the times when I feel okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My childhood was good. Probably my only good chapter in life, thus far. Things turned sour as a teenager, but I still managed to get through school, although poorly, and eventually got a job somehow. I worked for several years, but life weighed down on me, and it got harder and harder. I struggled focusing and procastinated things till the point I could no longer do my job properly. I quit. I initially planned a to off myself, my go-to plan in life in case things turned too sour, but I never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried so many times to turn things around, but nothing has stuck. I feel unable to change anything. I’ve tried so many things, read so many guides and advice, gotten hopeful and really tried my best, but I’ve always just returned to my usual state of mind and way of life. I’m in an eternal rut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been unemployed for years now. I pretty much just gave up and laid down to rot away. The way back – the mountain ahead of me, it’s just too massive. But even if I manage to start climbing, I’ll just be as miserable as I was before. I don’t know. I feel like I’m damaged goods, unable to change anything about myself. I think the depression that has been a part of me has changed me permanently at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apathy is the worst. And the procastination and lack of focus. I feel unable to do anything at all. Zero motivation, and worse, zero discipline. I wish I could do things. I wish I had goals and worked torwards those goals. I wish I could focus and read books, clean up, make things, finish projects, etc. Just anything. I don&amp;#39;t feel like picking up the spoon to eat my dinner most days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never seeked help. I’ve never been on medication. I feel like a fraud thinking I need help. I’ve just been drifting along in limbo, feeling numb, and letting life fly me by. I need to make a real effort, I need to really try, something, anything. What should I do to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear is that, if I eventually figure it out somehow, is that the thought of me already being so old, the thought of it being way too late, will haunt me and drag me back down. If I find the cure, I will hate myself for not finding it 5, 10 or 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds worse than it is, I think. I don’t feel good writing this, but I’m not always miserable. I’m okay, and I have good days. I just wish I was happier more often, or happy for real, I suppose. I need to change and live life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was nice today. I wish I went outside.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Ever since I (20) started having mental health issues it seems like my parents have wanted me to get off of medications. They see them as “weak” and just talk about the side effects but they actually help me. I think my dad is doing it so that eventually he can force me into the military but fuck that.

They have a relationship with my therapist who had me sign some forms so he could “get information from them” which made me think that he tells them everything (they are patients of his) so I don’t really tell him shit I just go through the motions in my sessions. He also is pushing against medication.

,depression,"Hello!

Right now I am in complete despair, as I am in total disorientation, but I have a faint hope that one of you will be able to support and / or console me.

My story in a nutshell is this: four months ago I abruptly stopped taking Zyprexa because I thought I had not taken it long enough (only three weeks) and at a not too dangerous sub-therapeutic dose (2.5 mg) per day to tire myself with deprescribing. Unfortunately, three or four days after this risky maneuver, something suddenly switched in my head: since then, my personality seemed to dissolve without a trace, I stopped experiencing any emotions and enjoying my former hobbies. I just spend the last months in bed without getting out because of anhedonia, amotivation and apathy: it’s hard for me to mobilize myself just to take a glass of water.

The persistence of my symptoms terribly demoralizes me: it begins to seem to me that the instant termination of olanzapine could provoke some organic defects in my brain, such as damage to the nucleus accumbens...

,depression,"I usually just ""walk"" off being depressed and lonely. I'm currently in another country serving. Things have been hard for the past maybe two/three years. I don't have a very ""solid"" family yes they're not entirely scummy, evil, etc. But sometimes I tend to drink a lot while I'm out here, mainly because (I used to smoke to cope and well I can't) and sometimes it feels good to occasionally not be overthinking etc. Anyways whenever I call them they get worried for me instead of just be there and tend to go back to my mom saying oh she's drinking again as if people my age aren't going to bars and getting shitfaced.

Anyways that leads to my post. I try to make friends, I really do. In fact, I am always inviting people over, trying to create experiences etc. It's gonna sound fucked up because I have EXTREMELY low self-esteem but some people I'm ""semi"" close with say maybe it's because I am intimidating. I just don't know about that because the second anyone allows me to open up I literally divulge any and everything which is terrible and super embarrassing. It's like oh I haven't talked to a person other than casual work convos and I guess it feels good to talk? This year though I have learned to cut anything off that makes me feel more alone, a lot of people will intentionally make plans with me and cancel and it hurts because they'll go out and I just end up home because I don't have many friends, so I started just saying fuck it, I will be alone. It's been a very intimate journey, I hate it but I also am forcing myself to like it. (Sorry for the rant) I am getting a dog soon, I've been obsessing over a dog lately I think because it's going to feel amazing having something that wants to be around me as much as I want to be around them (corny I know) 

I just hate the feeling of having no other option. I put myself out there and get pushed away. I have two ""friends"" and they live thousands of miles away with their own lives. I know other people have worse problems but sometimes I don't know? I don't know what depression is supposed to feel like, I tend to talk to myself that's how alone I feel. I tend to call people crying when I do drink because it's the only time I let things out. I don't know maybe the dog is like my final solution.

,depression,"They say that the average man cries anywhere between 5-17 times a year, and other studies say as much as 22 times. I don’t know if I’ve reached either of those. Maybe I did in the past; I dunno. But at the very least since the start of the pandemic, I’m not sure if I’ve cried at all. Not really, anyway. 

I don’t think I’ve ever been good at crying. I know it’s good for me, and all, but I can’t even when I try. The last time I can vividly remember my crying, tho I assume and am pretty positive there’s probably other times, was in junior year of high school. I was sad or some girl or something. Can you imagine being so privileged that you can cry over a girl? I wish I could be that lucky again. Even then though, I remember I still had to make an effort. I could tell I needed to cry, and I knew it would take some work to make it happen. But still, at least it came out. 

It’s years later now and I am not positive that I have cried more than like twice or three times in these last two years. If even that… I can’t even remember them, i’m just guessing. Now, I’ve had every reason to cry for several weeks straight and I don’t. I just filled my midterm exam, I couldn’t have possibly gotten more than 15 out of 100 points, And my life is nothing but work, and on the news I can see that my delusional country is doing nothing but going to shit as rules block anyone from doing anything meaningful, and I am behind on my major, and I doubt I’ll be able to graduate in four years, and I have no motivations on what I want to major in anyway, and all I have to look forward to is being a slave to the machine, or dying in a ditch, and all of my friends barely know me, and they recently lost one of my biggest safe spaces, and even with all of that I can’t do anything to turn anything around. And I want to cry. But I can’t. I think I’ve been trying for like an hour, terms of been hit hard enough that my eyes are getting blurry and some droplets would come out. But I can’t make anything more than that. I just wanna cry. For like six minutes.

It’s taking everything I have not to just give up and let my academic record be destroyed. But I can’t keep doing this I need to let it out and I don’t know how.

I don’t care about anything anymore. I don’t want to see my friends. I don’t want to work. I don’t want to do anything I just want to quit. One of my friends quit. I wish she was here right now. I miss her.

I don’t even know who I could turn to. I think I need a therapist. But whenever I want to get one, how would I do it? I have to go through my mom. And she wants me to get one so bad. She never shuts up about it. I feel like if I tell her anything, I just prove everything right that she thinks about me but says she doesn’t.

She was diagnosed with Kidney disease and was told her had ""a few weeks to a few months"" left to live but ""maybe longer if she got some medication""

I didn't even have enough money to get her ashes back because I spent so much money on the last vet visit.

,depression,"The flex part - Im from the UK. I'm 21, I make £53k a year, I'm outside of London and have no debt, no degree and work fully remote 9-5 mon-fri, I enjoy my job and have a good team, and good friends outside of work. I don't drink, or smoke, or do drugs or party/club. I'm in a long term stable relationship of almost 4 years with my girlfriend.
I enjoy driving and I'm hoping to get a fun car soon, then a house. 
Between my girlfriend and me we'll have about £45k deposit for a house and it should get us a nice 3 bed semi detached. I can have a garage to work on a project car and a nice home office. She can have a home gym.

Good ey? That's what everyone sees.


I just feel hollow behind the eyes. I don't feel real anymore, I feel like I have to act to be myself because I'm truly just miserable and nihilistic. A few things have contributed to it, and I have time to rattle them off if anyone cares to read.

About 6 months ago my girlfriend said guys at the gym hit on her - I'm a skinny guy, I'm insecure about it but I can't gain weight. She insists she finds me attractive but I'm self critical. One of these guys finds her on Instagram through a mutual acquaintance and processes to send messages about the things he wants to do to her. She brushes it off and doesn't tell me. It hurts that she didn't tell me. Eventually I find out because I see his page and she asks why I view his Instagram stories, which if nothing was going on she wouldn't have asked. She insists she ignored his advances and told him to stop, and blocks him. I insist on seeing the messages but they ""go missing"" when she unblocks him to show me. Whatever, I trust her, but still throughout all this she still goes gym 3 times a week, I'm filled with anxiety and nausea every time. 

I mention she should file a complaint and shes hesitant but does. Nothing comes of it. The rat is still allowed in the gym after literally sexually harassing people.

The raw emotive part of me wants to wait outside with a hammer and a few mates and just beat him, or gut him.

The other half of me is just fucking tired. I thought I'd found a good girl but now my guts off and my head just fucking spins. I truly believe she hasn't cheated, and I don't think she's reciprocated or anything, but it fucking hurts knowing she still hid it from me and there's no way I can be 100% sure. 

Part of me wants to threaten the gym into banning him, but realistically it's a fine legal line and Its too risky.

As I said, I like driving so that's what I've been doing. I've been driving 30-40 miles most nights with music on just hooning my car 110mph down back roads for the adrenaline rush because it feels amazing and I feel alive from it.

I wish I could just switch my fucking head off. This entire 6 month process has been played like chess with me delicately phrasing and constructing to try and seep information and I'm fed up. I wanna go back 6 months to when I was just happy before all this shit.

I had a therapist and I was doing CBT, but she wasnt any good and you can run rings around them. Waste of time and effort for me.

I&amp;#39;m 21, I make £53k a year, I&amp;#39;m outside of London and have no debt, no degree and work fully remote 9-5 mon-fri, I enjoy my job and have a good team, and good friends outside of work. I don&amp;#39;t drink, or smoke, or do drugs or party/club. I&amp;#39;m in a long term stable relationship of almost 4 years with my girlfriend.
I enjoy driving and I&amp;#39;m hoping to get a fun car soon, then a house. 
Between my girlfriend and me we&amp;#39;ll have about £45k deposit for a house and it should get us a nice 3 bed semi detached. I can have a garage to work on a project car and a nice home office. She can have a home gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ey? That&amp;#39;s what everyone sees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel hollow behind the eyes. I don&amp;#39;t feel real anymore, I feel like I have to act to be myself because I&amp;#39;m truly just miserable and nihilistic. A few things have contributed to it, and I have time to rattle them off if anyone cares to read.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The worst thing about this disease is how it makes you focus on all the darkness in your life. Everything thats ""wrong"" is magnified; it screams and yells and grabs your attention and refuses to let go.

I know there's good in my life. I know there are bright shining moments of pure joy and bliss...

But I can't see them because it's so dark. I can't hear them over the screaming in my head. These moments, fleeting as they may be, fall into the empty void where my soul should be and disappear.

And all Im left with it the wrong... the bad... the dark thoughts and ideas that fill my waking moments with dread and hunt my nightmares with such vigor.

I'm 44 now. Honestly, I'm not sure when the darkness took hold and refused to release me. It's been years now... decades...

I remember with perfect clarity an ex asking why I was so hateful and angry all the time?

I didn't have an answer. I knew I was broken, but didn't know why. I didn't understand it.

I remember being a child and my grandmother telling me I was just ""empty"" inside.

Can you imagine that? The woman who stepped up to raise me after my drug addict mother went to prison and my drug addict father disappeared on his most recent binge... The woman who chose to love and care for me, looking at me and seeing the hole, the void... and telling me with the utmost confidence it was there.

I think I was 11... maybe twelve...

So for at least 33years, this demon has hunted me. It's attached itself to me and refuses to let go. It sleeps sometimes... When I try, it slumbers. When I do, it retreats. Working out, listening to music, working on my passion projects, loving my wife... It doesn't like those moments. I sits in the dark corners of my mind, still, silent, waiting patiently for something to happen... waiting for the perfect moment to re-emerge and remind me that no matter what I do, it will always be here with me.

Its favorite thing is to don the guise of my addictions. The forms have changed throughout the years... At first it was video games, then it became the comfort of a womans body... When I came of age, it became gambling. That's its favorite. It loves to wait until I have money... until I have the chance to climb out of the financial whole I've dug for myself... Oh how patient it is...

And then it whispers.... ""This time will be different. This time... you'll win! I promise... You'll win and be able to pay off your debt AND keep some money in your pocket.""

I've felt that lie inside my head more times than I can count... and fell for it each and every fucking time.

My wife deserves a medal. She tries so hard... as hard I push her away... still she tries.

The demon hates her most. ""Look how plain she is!"" it screams. ""Look how overweight she is! You know you want one of those women you see when you watch porn or when you scroll through instagram... why cant she look like them? Why is she so lazy? Why is it so hard for her to workout and get fit? Who cares that she loves and adores you? Who cares that she will march through the gates of hell at your side? She's not sexy enough to be with you! Her love doesn't matter. Her loyalty is a lie! You can do better! You deserver better!""

But I don't.

Ten years she's been there, holding me when I cry, lifting me when I can't stand, telling me she's right here and isnt going anywhere. I know I don't deserve her. I don't deserve anyone really... not as damaged and broken as I am. Who deserves to be served a steaming pile of shit and made to believe its everything they ever wanted and need?

The kids... my god... those poor children.

The worst thing I could give my son is this disease. I see it growing in him as it did with me; the rage, the withdrawal, the frustration, the overwhelming feeling that something... that everything is wrong... that a part of you is broken, and unable to fix or control it.

The youngest of the boys wont even return my phone calls. He feels abandoned. He resides with his grandmother on the other side of the country and feels alone... unloved... unwanted...

The 16yo girl that sleeps in the other room gives me anxiety. There's no relationship there. We are at the same time too similar and too different. She sits in her room and watches the same videos and movies time and again. Or she comes into ours and insists we sit through back to back music videos featuring Korean boys that look like girls and lyrics I don't understand. ""But you should like it because I like it!"" she tells me. ""You should be passionate about it because I am!"" she begs.

My parents never did such a thing! They were too busy smoking crack to care about my interests or hobbies, so excuse the fuck outta me if I never learned how to be a parent that actually gives a shit.

I havent touched my wife in almost a month. She stares at me, eyes filled with resentment... My mind has been so completely infected by the darkness, my body no longer gets excited. Her naked frame walking through the room fills me with regret. There were so many others... how sexy they were. How delightfully enticing. Two were actually fitness models. I stalk them on social media and remember the feel of their skin. I close my eyes and remember the sight of them beneath me, on top of me, before me... so eager to please...

I look at my wife and wonder ""Why you?""

I know the answer; she found me broken and tried her best to put me back together. She tries still, like a house of cards, so fragile and weak... She spends so much time and so much effort building me up, loving me, helping me, encouraging me, caring about me... and with one whisper from the darkness... it all comes crashing down around her.

And she takes a breath and starts over again.

God, its so unfair to her... to let her be so close to me when mentally, emotionally, and even now, physically, I'm an ocean away. And ocean of rage and regret, waves of sadness and anxiety crashing against crumpling shores, eroding my will and desire away, begging me to come... wade into the cold darkness... let it embrace you... let it consume you... there's peace here. Eternal everlasting peace. You don't have to hurt anymore. You don't have to suffer this pain, this torment... Just come and let the darkness take you... take your last breath... and give you peace.

""That's the cowards way out.""

That's what they say. And they are right... I am a coward. I bullet to the head would do it. A quick flick down the wrist with any of the box cutters in my garage. A stab of pain and then the eternal dark... It would be so easy...

But I'm afraid. I choose the long way out... a pack a day will get the job done... eventually. I can already feel my lungs struggling. The pain in my chest is undeniably. Especially when I run or even walk fast.

God, I used to be in such shape. Women would stare at my body. The demon was sure to take that away first. I tried to fight back. I spent over $1000 on workout equipment and set it all up in the backyard. I went hard almost everyday for a good while. I could see my abs again.

Then my wife walked into the room, fresh from a shower and the demon laughed. ""How silly you look, all muscle and tone, atop such a sloppy mass of flesh. Too bad she makes no effort to workout beside you.""

It was a lie of course. She tires. But the demon was so loud...

Fuck!

The meds don't help. Ive asked for the dosage to be upped twice now. My libido is gone. Porn is comedy. My wife in lingerie makes me sad.

I don't work. I started a business... It's falling. The last bit of money I made I donated at the casino.

That last session broke me, I think. My will to continue is a candle light in a wind storm. I can't handle another gust.

Im so broken. The darkness is so complete now... it hurts so much... I tried to cry but the tears wont come. I beat myself in the head and scream silently at least three times a day... more when I think about how deep the hole is now.

I don't know why I wrote this. Maybe I hope getting it out will help.

Maybe you'll understand.

,depression,"I accidentally cheated on an assignment and feel awful.

I know cheated, regardless of my ignorant reasons, or intentions cheating is CHEATING.

I'm trying to use the fact it was an accident as an excuse but that really doesn't change anything, does it?

I cheated and the more i think about it the more i try and justify that it was a mistake, because apparently i'm somewhere above the rules where mistakes don't count

It was so stupid , how did i think that using real past question wasn't against the rules, i guess i just don't listen?!? Everyone else seemed to know, when i told someone else i'd done this they acted as if i was insane for even admitting it to them - telling me it was 1000000% cheating, I can't even explain the panic i felt. I. Can't. Believe. I. Cheated. Why. Did. I. Do. This.

I didn't even need to cheat, i literally was perfectly capable of doing it by myself. I'm just an idiot who thought that i'd found some cool resources to help me ughhhhh. I would do anything to undo it, looking back its like was i not even thinking?? Hind sight and all that i guess.

On top of that even tried to submit the document with just the answers i had before i found the past questions and started cheating, thinking maybe i'd get away with it, as if that just undid everything, in the end i didn't even submit anything because i felt so bad for cheating - this being my pitiful attempt to make things right, I still cannot believe i cheated, or tried to cheat, or accidentally tried to cheat I guess, since nothing was actually submitted - see i'm just making excused again.

I hate breaking rules and literally broke the biggest one. I don't even know if i turned myself in due to regret of what i did or fear of being caught and that just makes me feel even worse, would i even get in trouble for cheating when i submitted nothing? I don't even know.

As soon as i realised i turned myself in as soon as possible, but still just feel awful, I explained the whole situation and they were so understanding and helpful and lovely, but somehow it makes me feel worse, like i don't deserve the understanding. ignorance shouldn't be an excuse to do what i want.

After a nights sleep and a clear mind i realised it was just a mistake and thought that it was okay so tried my best to explain the whole thing, completely and honestly and felt good about it at the time but now it just feels like a cop out, i did what i did and saying again and again how it was a mistake doesn't change anything, maybe i was too nice to myself, maybe they just pitied me

i'm so anxious that i've thrown up 3 times today and it just gets worse and worse.

I posted that i'd cheated from finding the questions to a uni sub and they basically all said i'd get kicked out if the uni found out and i feel like i should. I cannot believe that i cheated. i have no idea why i cheated or why i thought using those questions was okay. I have no idea why even felt the need to use the questions, i have no idea how i didn't realise. Maybe they'd have been nicer if they knew it was a mistake, but i doubt it. I didn't think they'd believe my anyways and why should they, i don't think i'd believe me in anyone elses shoes . my mum insisted i tell the full story and explain how it was unintentional to the actual uni and i guess i should be very thankful for that because they actually did believe me completely , to my great surprise - at least at the end of the day honesty does pay off.

I'm trying to tell myself its okay, it was an accident, i have learnt from my actions but i still just feel like shit.

one second i think everything is fine and the next second i feel like the world is falling apart

I am so disappointed in myself, i don't feel like i even deserve a degree anymore, i really think i'm going to have to drop out because i really can't take the stress. I would in a heartbeat if it didn't let my parents down even more than i already have. I want a degree and really was enjoying my studies but of course i messed it all up - i can't have one thing going well for me, can i?

My mums trying to make me feel better, saying i'm blowing this out of all proportion and maybe i am but i just can't stop obsessing over the whole thing, all that time i spent LITERALLY cheating, thinking nothing of it, like i just wish i could go back to past me and scream in my face what i'm doing. HOW. WAS, I , SO, STUPID. i feel like such an idiot.

I guess this does seem like an over reaction but is just the straw that broke the camels back kind of thing, i was already going down and this just gave me a push.

I don't know how to move on from this, and i know to many this is going to sound absolutely insane but i just can't stop playing the entire thing over and over and over again in my head, i don't know if its even this incident that is the problem or if my brain just likes to over fixate, oof",t2_g9lnyl0b,False,,0,False,i hate myself,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tn7nli,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,1648162485.0,,[],{},,True,,1648161879.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accidentally cheated on an assignment and feel awful.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm 24 years old, turning 25 soon in a few months. I live in constant dread. I have no passion, no goals, no special achievement in my life, and never been in a relationship. I don't know what I want nor what I'm doing in this so called life. Everything just feels exhausting. I cry myself to sleep everyday.

I also feel extremely disconnected from others. I don't fit in even though I try the hardest to be a decent human being. I try to treat others with kindness and respect, be a good listener, help people when they need my help, work hard, exercise on daily basis, take a good care of my appearance. But, no matter how hard I try to present myself at best, I still feel I don't fit in. I still feel empty, unworthy and unwanted.

I want to do something that I could be proud of, but no matter what I do, I still never feel I'm good enough even for myself. I crave for meaningful connection. I want to have someone to share and spend my days with, laugh with, cry with, share my handmade gifts with just to see smile on their face. Someone that feels like ""home"" because I've been feeling ""homeless"" all this time. I want to feel loved, cared for, and wanted for once. But it's like it's just this idea of meaningful connection that I have in my head. I can even barely hold a conversation, whenever I try to talk to someone, I feel extremely drained. I'm stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time.

I live in constant dread. I have no passion, no goals, no special achievement in my life, and never been in a relationship. I don&amp;#39;t know what I want nor what I&amp;#39;m doing in this so called life. Everything just feels exhausting. I cry myself to sleep everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel extremely disconnected from others. I don&amp;#39;t fit in even though I try the hardest to be a decent human being. I try to treat others with kindness and respect, be a good listener, help people when they need my help, work hard, exercise on daily basis, take a good care of my appearance. But, no matter how hard I try to present myself at best, I still feel I don&amp;#39;t fit in. I still feel empty, unworthy and unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do something that I could be proud of, but no matter what I do, I still never feel I&amp;#39;m good enough even for myself. I crave for meaningful connection. I want to have someone to share and spend my days with, laugh with, cry with, share my handmade gifts with just to see smile on their face. Someone that feels like &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve been feeling &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; all this time. I want to feel loved, cared for, and wanted for once. But it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s just this idea of meaningful connection that I have in my head. I can even barely hold a conversation, whenever I try to talk to someone, I feel extremely drained.

,depression,"I am a convicted felon. (narcotics possession)
In 2016 my dad died at 56 from cancer. Had 3 other relatives die from cancer before that.
I moved out of the apartment I shared with my ex fiance and moved back home after promising my dying dad I would look after my mom.
I learned way too much about the world, news, politics, economics, history, conspiracy theories, etc.
Got insanely depressed. Started using a lot of drugs.
My best friend sent me some crazy texts in 2018. I thought about going to check on him but laughed it off. Next day he was dead. Suicide by cop. I blamed myself.
My fiance of 6 years left me after that after some arguments.
I got involved with a girl my dead friend was friends with. We were depressed about his death and she got me on heroin.
She became my new gf and moved in with me.
We spiraled into drug addiction.
I got arrested many times.
She left me a year later for an abusive douche with money.
I spiraled into depression.
I immediately hooked up with her friend who was also an addict. She became my new gf.
She went to jail.
I went to jail for 7 months. 
While I was in jail my friend robbed me blind. Sold my vehicle and stole thousands of dollars worth of tools.
Got out right before Xmas 2019
Mother refused to let me come home until March 2020
That gf broke up with me and chose heroin over me after getting out due to COVID in March 2020.
I am on probation until 2025
I haven't been able to drive since July 15 2019 when I was thrown in jail.
I was alone and jobless, depressed about the pandemic from March 2020 until Sept 2020 when I met another girl at a party.
Told her I had no phone, no license, she gave me her email and number anyway.
Neighbor gave me a job the next day.
She picked me up a week later and went out.
Literally had more in common with her than anyone I have ever met.
We fell in love so hard it was crazy. I couldn't believe how lucky I was and she was cool with me living at home with no license.
Told her about my past early on. She had traumatic experiences with her older brother who was a drug addict.
I'm happy for the first time in YEARS with her.
Figure out that she takes a lot of mail-order Xanax and has an adderall prescription for her MS.
We smoke weed, drink together, take LSD sometimes. She gives me Xanax sometimes.
She found out that I tried to buy some coke from my buddy because my boss wanted some. He screenshotted that text and sent it to her for NO REASON.
Never mentioned it to me.
She starts acting very paranoid.
Loses her job working from home because it seems like she's scared to answer the phone.
Accuses me one night of smearing invisible drugs on the wall and absorbing them through my skin. Lots of other weird stuff too.
Constantly accuses me of doing heroin/meth/cocaine.
She goes through all the stuff in my workshop, finds 3 needles I forgot about a long time ago. Doesn't say anything.
Accuses me of putting drugs on the fridge door handle, and other crazy shit involving drugs that make no sense.
I buy a drug test and take it right in front of her and pass everything except for weed. She calmed down a bit.
2 days later my friend comes over for a beer after she left. He gives me 3 Xanax.
She finds out he came over and flips out on me.
Ghosts me for a week.
Texts me and accuses me of putting drugs in her lotion and her vape. Says I cheated on the urine test I took somehow.
Breaks up with me.
I try like hell to get her back for 2 months.
She comes back and tells me she thought I was breaking into her apartment and putting drugs in her wall and she spent hours chipping paint off her wall. Don't know what to say except that I would never do anything like that even if I was secretly on drugs and nobody else ever would.
Talking with her best friend constantly who also thinks shes losing it.
I realize she's really losing her mind.
For a week she's scared to come back in the house so we go out on dates and have sex in her car instead.
Things calm down I slowly convince her to come back inside and we're back together.
She admits she has a Xanax problem and we start going to NA meetings together for both of us.
One night we get back from an NA meeting and dinner together and she goes to the bathroom.
Comes out crying saying she can't stay over tonight because I'm re-grouting the tiles on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet and mixing drugs in the grout.
The floor was wet from condensation making the grout in front of the toilet look darker.
Have a huge talk about all of this. She said I'm trying to get her hooked on heroin.
Deny everything because it's obviously not true and try to explain things using logic. 
She says that because I used to be an addict I'm always going to want to do it again.
Finally calm her down and we go to bed.
Next morning I leave to go to work.
Walk down the street to my boss's house and wait for him for an hour. He's taking forever.
Wonder why she hasn't left my house yet.
Go back home and open the door and surprise her.
I walk into the bathroom and see that she's been squeezing out my toothpaste into the sink, also some of my shaving cream and cologne.
We go outside, talk like nothing happened, and she leaves.
Later I come back home after work and find that she was peeling some of the paint off my wall.
She comes back a few days later for her birthday and we had a good time, nothing weird happened.
Week later she ghosts me out of nowhere.
Heartbroken as hell again. After a few days of texting her my friend gives me some Xanax.
I take a Xanax bar to try to calm down and drink some beers, pass out on the basement floor.
My other friend drops by and calls an ambulance.
The ambulance shows up and my mom asks me if I'm trying to kill myself. Don't remember any of this.
I say if I wanted to die I'd already be dead.
That's all the paramedics needed to hear.
They take me to the hospital and lock me in a room for 2 days.
Then they take my phone away and take me to a psych ward.
I feel so heartbroken and depressed I wanna die but I hold it together and act like I'm ok.
After 10 days the psych Dr. diagnosed me with depression and clears me to leave.
My mother's house is my address, so they call her and tell her.
She tells them to keep me there because she's pissed that I did Xanax. Tells them to put me straight in a rehab.
I realize I'm fucked and my mother's abandoning me too and start thinking about killing myself as soon as I get out.
After 2 months locked in the psych ward she finally agrees to let me come home.
Mom picks me up.
Get my phone back, try to get in touch with my gf that I'm literally dying over.
No answer.
I lay down in bed for 2 weeks.
Boss finally lets me come back to work.
I get in touch with ex's best friend (lets call her ann and call my ex sarah)
Ann says Sarah ghosted her too a week after I got hospitalized because she found out that she did coke with her ex bf a few times.
Ann gets in touch with Sarah's daughter and her daughter says her mom is very sick.
Says Sarah is destroying the furniture and stuff in their apartment looking for drugs that I planted there, even cutting pillows open.
Says if we try to go over there to see her mom she'll call the cops.
I am devastated.
Ann keeps trying to get in touch with my ex Sarah through her daughter.
Daughter says she's crazy and she thinks it's all really happening and she's moving out and removing herself from the situation.
I start texting her and writing long emails and letters pouring my heart out to her.
No answer for over 7 months since the breakup.
I am in hell everyday, overthinking, heartbroken hell to the point where I have dreams about it. I drove her crazy by being an idiot.
Worst breakup of my life and I STILL can't drive yet.
Probation found out I was in the psych ward and they are making me jump through 1000 extra hoops.
I will never have another gf that I have that much in common with and she hates me and thinks I want to poison her.
I see no future other than working like a blue-collar slave until I die in a world where I can't trust anyone anymore, not even my own mother, and society is going to shit.
The love of my life is gone forever and it's all MY FAULT for being a scumbag drug user.

(narcotics possession)
In 2016 my dad died at 56 from cancer. Had 3 other relatives die from cancer before that.
I moved out of the apartment I shared with my ex fiance and moved back home after promising my dying dad I would look after my mom.
I learned way too much about the world, news, politics, economics, history, conspiracy theories, etc.
Got insanely depressed. Started using a lot of drugs.
My best friend sent me some crazy texts in 2018. I thought about going to check on him but laughed it off. Next day he was dead. Suicide by cop. I blamed myself.
My fiance of 6 years left me after that after some arguments.
I got involved with a girl my dead friend was friends with. We were depressed about his death and she got me on heroin.
She became my new gf and moved in with me.
We spiraled into drug addiction.
I got arrested many times.
She left me a year later for an abusive douche with money.
I spiraled into depression.
I immediately hooked up with her friend who was also an addict. She became my new gf.
She went to jail.
I went to jail for 7 months. 
While I was in jail my friend robbed me blind. Sold my vehicle and stole thousands of dollars worth of tools.
Got out right before Xmas 2019
Mother refused to let me come home until March 2020
That gf broke up with me and chose heroin over me after getting out due to COVID in March 2020.
I am on probation until 2025
I haven&amp;#39;t been able to drive since July 15 2019 when I was thrown in jail.
I was alone and jobless, depressed about the pandemic from March 2020 until Sept 2020 when I met another girl at a party.
Told her I had no phone, no license, she gave me her email and number anyway.
Neighbor gave me a job the next day.
She picked me up a week later and went out.
Literally had more in common with her than anyone I have ever met.
We fell in love so hard it was crazy. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe how lucky I was and she was cool with me living at home with no license.
Told her about my past early on. She had traumatic experiences with her older brother who was a drug addict.
I&amp;#39;m happy for the first time in YEARS with her.
Figure out that she takes a lot of mail-order Xanax and has an adderall prescription for her MS.
We smoke weed, drink together, take LSD sometimes. She gives me Xanax sometimes.
She found out that I tried to buy some coke from my buddy because my boss wanted some. He screenshotted that text and sent it to her for NO REASON.
Never mentioned it to me.
She starts acting very paranoid.
Loses her job working from home because it seems like she&amp;#39;s scared to answer the phone.
Accuses me one night of smearing invisible drugs on the wall and absorbing them through my skin. Lots of other weird stuff too.
Constantly accuses me of doing heroin/meth/cocaine.
She goes through all the stuff in my workshop, finds 3 needles I forgot about a long time ago. Doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.
Accuses me of putting drugs on the fridge door handle, and other crazy shit involving drugs that make no sense.
I buy a drug test and take it right in front of her and pass everything except for weed. She calmed down a bit.
2 days later my friend comes over for a beer after she left. He gives me 3 Xanax.
She finds out he came over and flips out on me.
Ghosts me for a week.
Texts me and accuses me of putting drugs in her lotion and her vape. Says I cheated on the urine test I took somehow.
Breaks up with me.
I try like hell to get her back for 2 months.
She comes back and tells me she thought I was breaking into her apartment and putting drugs in her wall and she spent hours chipping paint off her wall. Don&amp;#39;t know what to say except that I would never do anything like that even if I was secretly on drugs and nobody else ever would.
Talking with her best friend constantly who also thinks shes losing it.
I realize she&amp;#39;s really losing her mind.
For a week she&amp;#39;s scared to come back in the house so we go out on dates and have sex in her car instead.
Things calm down I slowly convince her to come back inside and we&amp;#39;re back together.
She admits she has a Xanax problem and we start going to NA meetings together for both of us.
One night we get back from an NA meeting and dinner together and she goes to the bathroom.
Comes out crying saying she can&amp;#39;t stay over tonight because I&amp;#39;m re-grouting the tiles on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet and mixing drugs in the grout.
The floor was wet from condensation making the grout in front of the toilet look darker.
Have a huge talk about all of this. She said I&amp;#39;m trying to get her hooked on heroin.
Deny everything because it&amp;#39;s obviously not true and try to explain things using logic. 
She says that because I used to be an addict I&amp;#39;m always going to want to do it again.
Finally calm her down and we go to bed.
Next morning I leave to go to work.
Walk down the street to my boss&amp;#39;s house and wait for him for an hour. He&amp;#39;s taking forever.
Wonder why she hasn&amp;#39;t left my house yet.
Go back home and open the door and surprise her.
I walk into the bathroom and see that she&amp;#39;s been squeezing out my toothpaste into the sink, also some of my shaving cream and cologne.
We go outside, talk like nothing happened, and she leaves.
Later I come back home after work and find that she was peeling some of the paint off my wall.
She comes back a few days later for her birthday and we had a good time, nothing weird happened.
Week later she ghosts me out of nowhere.
Heartbroken as hell again. After a few days of texting her my friend gives me some Xanax.
I take a Xanax bar to try to calm down and drink some beers, pass out on the basement floor.
My other friend drops by and calls an ambulance.
The ambulance shows up and my mom asks me if I&amp;#39;m trying to kill myself. Don&amp;#39;t remember any of this.
I say if I wanted to die I&amp;#39;d already be dead.
That&amp;#39;s all the paramedics needed to hear.
They take me to the hospital and lock me in a room for 2 days.
Then they take my phone away and take me to a psych ward.
I feel so heartbroken and depressed I wanna die but I hold it together and act like I&amp;#39;m ok.
After 10 days the psych Dr. diagnosed me with depression and clears me to leave.
My mother&amp;#39;s house is my address, so they call her and tell her.
She tells them to keep me there because she&amp;#39;s pissed that I did Xanax. Tells them to put me straight in a rehab.
I realize I&amp;#39;m fucked and my mother&amp;#39;s abandoning me too and start thinking about killing myself as soon as I get out.
After 2 months locked in the psych ward she finally agrees to let me come home.
Mom picks me up.
Get my phone back, try to get in touch with my gf that I&amp;#39;m literally dying over.

This has led me to be a faker. I can act friendly and even charming at times, but in truth I am very lonely. Because of this, any attractive person who shows me the least but of attention, I give my whole loyalty to them, in case of women I fall in ""love"" with them. 

And when these people undoubtedly get tired of me, I feel pathetic and get engulfed by the most useless emotion ever, self pity.

,depression,"Depression is riding me hard this week. I keep telling myself I have good reasons to be depressed. I just got laid off from a job I thought would last me through retirement. I got one month of severance, and I have savings, so we can last 2 months total before we're homeless. I'm in the 4th week of being unemployed with no prospects in sight. My bosses effing screwed me. I worked for a pair of entrepreneurs who had a couple startups. They shut down their companies simultaneously. I was the head of the marketing department. Which means I was the head of marketing for 2 companies that suddenly failed. Both companies were healthy as far as I knew. I had stats showing steady growth every single month. But because the owners decided to shut down out of the blue, on paper it looks like I oversaw the demise of 2 companies. On the same day. So, yeah, my career is in the toilet. Had 3 interviews, no offers, and tons of ghosting and rejection. I'm the sole support for 4 people, and I can't get a job in my field. 18 years of experience means I'm either way over qualified or too much trouble to take on. So I'm fighting that amidst feelings of hopelessness and failure and worthlessness. I'm failing everyone I love. We're going to end up homeless. 

Today, I found myself wondering just how fast I needed to be driving in order to guarantee dying in a car wreck. Because I want to find a way to end it that will be seen as an accident. I don't want my son to think it's his fault. So that's the only thing stopping me. Not my son; the problem of finding a way to make it look like an accident. I don't want to die...yet. But I'm so tired of trying and failing. And failing. And failing. This isn't the first time we've been this close to being homeless. This is the third time. How can I avoid feeling like a completely useless failure when this keeps happening? It must be me. I'm the one who keeps effing up. So the insidious thought raises its head. That maybe if I wasn't here to effing everything up, then everything would get better for everyone who depends on me. I'm so tired of failing. So tired of trying. There comes a point where you wonder why you're bothering to pick yourself up again. Why try so hard? Gonna fail no matter what. I've been here before. I keep ending up back here no matter how hard i try. So why am I trying at all?

""Get a job."" I'm effing trying. I've sent out 76 resumes.
""Get treatment."" 1, I no longer have insurance. 2, I'm already on Depression meds. Not helping.
""Can't you ask your family for help?"" No. My family is poor. My mom lives on my couch. I have no family to ask.
""What about unemployment payments? Government help."" Already on it. It's not enough to cover my rent. 
""Just give it time. You'll find a job."" Desperation shows. I'm likely to settle for ANY job. And I'll end up back where we started, not making enough to cover bills. I used to make decent money. Our life expenses matched that. I have obligations that cannot be avoided, period. I don't mean eating out and entertainment crap. Rent, cars, college, loans. I default on any of it, we're homeless. I just spent the last 5 years fixing my credit. In one month, all that work will be erased. Again. I’m just going to eff if up again, so why keep trying?
""Your family needs you."" Bullshit. My family depends on me to do EVERYTHING. And I'm the one effing everything up. They'd be better off if they stopped pretending that I'm dependable. Clearly, I'm not.

These are the arguments crashing through my brain. The crying jags are bad enough, but when you find yourself calmly wondering how to cause a car crash that'll be guaranteed to kill you...

,depression,"tw: suicide

Yea so my recent symptom of depression was that I thought I was really really old (I’m 23 lol). There were numerous occasions where I had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain was certain I’m 25 or 26, had to count years from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that I’m 23. I thought most of it was because I’m seeing a lot of successful people on social media younger than me and because I’m not finished with my uni yet, because I’m repeating a year. 

But during therapy today I realized that beyond those reasons I also had this subconscious plan in my head that I will barely make it past 30. Like 35 tops and then I will be dead. I have no idea where it came from. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think I ever was. But my brain seems convinced that by the time I’m 30 I will develop suicidal thoughts, and then before 35 I will kill myself. 

No wonder I thought I was so old. I have a little more than 10 years before my “deadline” lol and that’s being generous.

I thought most of it was because I’m seeing a lot of successful people on social media younger than me and because I’m not finished with my uni yet, because I’m repeating a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during therapy today I realized that beyond those reasons I also had this subconscious plan in my head that I will barely make it past 30. Like 35 tops and then I will be dead. I have no idea where it came from. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think I ever was. But my brain seems convinced that by the time I’m 30 I will develop suicidal thoughts, and then before 35 I will kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder I thought I was so old. I have a little more than 10 years before my “deadline” lol and that’s being generous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk why I wrote this, I will probably delete this later. I just needed to dump this info somewhere, I don’t want to worry my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m sorry for writing this, feel free to ignore it. I’m just going through a lot and needed to get it out somewhere.

I’ve had depression for 9 years. It just keeps getting worse. I seriously lack the strength to keep up.

I’m barely making it through college. I do all of my work last minute and only show up when I have to. I think I’m failing one of my classes — there’s an assignment due almost every day and I can’t bring myself to complete all of them.

I quit my job in order to focus on college. I run a small business at home but nobody thinks it’s real or legit. Now everyone is getting onto me for being unemployed. I’m constantly reminded that I’m not working hard enough, that I need to get a “real” job, etc. It feels like nothing I do is ever good enough.

If I’m not talking enough, my friends and family get put off. If I talk too much, then they get annoyed. I’m seriously considering just not opening my mouth or approaching anyone ever again and locking myself in my room. I’ll probably lose all of them, but at this point, I don’t know what else to do. I’m gonna get blamed and criticized regardless — at least then I’ll deserve it.

I’m aware that I’m doing the bare minimum and that’s not okay. But the fact that I’m doing the bare minimum is crazy enough. I have no energy, but somehow keep up with my hygiene and get out of bed every day — that’s an accomplishment, for me at least. My doctors’ insist on “waiting it out” and I feel like everyone thinks I’m making it up. The only time I cry is when I’m by myself because I can’t bring myself to vent to the same people telling me to get over myself.

I think I’m gonna give myself another year. If I truly don’t feel better, I’ll know that I spent a decade with this atrocity of an illness doing the best that I could. At least I can set myself free with that in mind.

Thanks for reading, if you did. Maybe this will resonate with someone, or inspire someone else to take it easy on someone they know.

,depression,"Everything I’ve ever done has all been in futility. I’ve wasted so much time on nothing. I’ve wasted so much time on wasting time. My life is a mess and I have nothing going for me. I hate myself and there’s never a moment where I’m the slightest bit happy. I wake up thinking about death, I go to sleep thinking about death, I dream about death. 

Everyone was right about me. I’m nothing and will be nothing. All ambition for my dreams is almost completely depleted, right alongside my will to live. 

I hate the apartment I live in. It’s disgusting. I’m too depressed to clean it. There’s trash everywhere. My dog makes it worse by pissing and shutting everywhere and knocking over trash cans while I’m asleep. It smells awful. My dishwasher doesn’t work. Half of the time my fridge doesn’t. So I have to doordash constantly, not only because the fridge but because I’m to depressed to cook. Which has made me gain a substantial amount of weight. I’ve gained 45 pounds since I’ve moved here to college. Which I’ve quit. 

I hate my relationship because I hate myself too much to even want to try. I’m just there. My girlfriend is also depressed and hates this place and doesn’t want to clean either. She never cleans her cat box. So her cat uses my clothes as a place to shit and piss. Now almost all of my clothes are ruined. I didn’t have many clothes before that because they all got stolen from the laundry mat. I have 2 pairs of underwear that I’ve been wearing for weeks. I only have two pairs of jeans I can wear to work. 

I hate my job. I’m a server at Applebees. I make very little money. Humans are just awful creatures when it comes to food service costumers. The only reason I still work there is because nearly all my co-workers are wonderful people. Which is the same reason everyone is working there. Everyone hates the work and pay, but we all enjoy each other immensely. 

I’m addicted to sleeping pills. I have been for the past 3 years. I take anywhere from 5 to 12 a night. When things are really bad I’ll take over 20. It’s probably ruined my liver and kidneys, but I haven’t really noticed anything different. No pain or anything. 

I can’t sleep at night. When I try I constantly lay there and hear noises. I have schizophrenia which makes it impossible to sleep if I’m not drugged out of my mind. I’m always scared that any minute someone is going to stab me or shoot me to death while I’m sleeping. So I hallucinate sounds like someone opening the front door or jiggling the door knob, or other things like that. Then if I do fall asleep I have horrible nightmares. 

All the time, every day, I hear the voices of my friends and family in distress saying “he’s killed himself/he’s shot himself/he’s hung himself/he’s missing” which is awful. These thoughts come to mind instead of me committing suicide. It’s the aftermath and affect it will have on the ones around me. It makes it so hard to concentrate on anything. 

I have a doctor, therapist, case worker, and career specialist. None of them have been able to help me. It’s because when I meet with them I act like everything is okay, there’s nothing wrong if they don’t ask. 

I’ve tried to find other jobs. I’ve been applying to at least 3 a week. But nothing. No emails no calls. Nothing. Only one job in the past 5 months had reached out. And it was a prison guard job that would be the first step in getting into the police force. Which was my plan B. My best friend is in the academy right now. 

The prison called me back and set up an interview. It was more of an interrogation but they said I still did very well and I felt like I did. They said after that they would decide if they would do the background check. 3 days later they said they would, which took 2 weeks. After that they asked me to come do a tour and see what everything is about. The other guards were shaking my hand and telling me it was good to have me there. They introduced me to some of the repeat offenders. I thought I had the job. 3 days later they said they were no longer were considering me. With no explanation. Which fucked me up and discouraged me even more than I already was. 

I can feel my bestfriend growing apart from me. We used to hangout almost everyday and send each other memes all the time. Now he leaves me on read and rarely responds. I went to the bar with him and he’s academy friends. They were all actually racist and I felt like they were only pretending to like me. 

I’m never excited for anything anymore. Haven’t been in years. I’ve lost all passion for anything. I haven’t played my guitars in months. I’ve always wanted to be a musician. More specifically the lead vocalist in a metal band. But that seems more and more impossible. I have the talent to, but no real way of achieving this goal. 

I sometimes go 4 days without showering. I try everyday to get someone to pick up my shift at work, and even offer the pay what little money I have. Just so I don’t have to go in. 

I haven’t talked to anyone in my family in a while. I don’t really want to. The only family member that I love really is my grandma. But I don’t really want to talk to her either. Just because I’m ashamed of who I become and it would kill her if she knew I was addicted to pills and started drinking. 

I hate my life. I don’t have the strength to do anything except wait until something falls in place, which nothing ever will. I want to die, but I’m scared of not existing. But all I am doing now is just existing. I feel like a tumor on humanity. Just existing until it goes away or something removes it. Not contributing but taking away.

,depression,"Hi guys, so as the title states, I'll be having my finals in about 7 weeks and I have absolutely no idea how to get through this and how to not fail those exams. I have trouble with studying, often can't concentrate, got the habit of just going to sleep whenever I should be studying, not finding motivation for most things, including studying and when finally studying I fall into a depressive phase quite quickly.

I know I will fail those exams without studying and I have to study, but I have no idea how to accomplish this. So the question for you guys basically is how can I get through this and pass my finals?

For Info about my current state of mental health (idk if it's relevant but I'll just write it down in case it's important)

\- I have had depression for about 5 years now

\- I'm on medication (fluoxetine rn)

\- I am in therapy, but I am not sure if it really helps. but finding another place is quite hard because all therapy places are full

\- Additionally to depression I have OCD which probably is related to the depression but we are not sure yet

\- I've lost motivation for many things, the only thing that can motivate me often is my boyfriend, but I do not know how he could help me with my studying

,depression,"Hello there 👋, first time posting on here as I have been a silent member of the group and only really comes on here to read others stories to relate to. But I think that this time I want to share my own story and just get it off my chest, because I have no where else to turn to anymore. I'm 23(M) from the UK, and I live with my parents, I'm unemployed, I don't even drive, and I don't have anything going on in my life anymore. I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for 5 years, but things have been really intense for the past 2-3 years now. I used to be so optimistic about life and wanted to do so many things with it like: explore different places, meet different people, create friendships and relationships, work and make money, and live life happily. I wanted to experience life to the best of my ability and just do something for myself to be happy and strive. Unfortunately, my life is just a waste of time and energy that is just waiting to die. These last few years have been really hard for me, on top of the pandemic and all the other bs, my depression was killing me inside and now I'm numb from it all, just a paralysed vessel with no soul to control it. This year alone, 3 months coming up to 4 months in and I've only left my house ONCE. Last year, I was only leaving my house to go to my therapy sessions twice a week for a little while, and sometimes I would go out with my mum to the shops but other than that I literally didn't go outside much. What the hell has happened to me?!? I have given up!! I no longer fight for my recovery, I have surrendered...
23 Years old with only one job I worked to my name that I didn't even complete, I don't even know how to drive or have my license, I didn't even complete my university degree (only did the first year), I have no friends, never had a relationship, never had sex, never even kissed a girl... My life is a complete mess and I am a MASSIVE FAILURE!
Why did I have to be born and why am I born in a life I have where I live under a roof, have food to eat, water to drink, a loving family, clothes, as well as all the luxuries that I do NOT deserve. There are people out there in the world who would kill or die to live in my life, live in this country, and live free, but there's me squandering this opportunity to live a better life.

Why can't I just die and give my life to someone who wants to live instead?
Why can't I sacrifice myself so someone can take my place and live better who will use this opportunity to live better?
Am I just an ungrateful prick?

I think my life is finished now, I think my time to die is slowly approaching and I want to just go over the edge. I am not looking for sympathy, I don't want to give myself any excuses for how my life has turned out. I just don't think I can live my life anymore and live on with a regret that will grow and grow every time I don't do something with my time on this planet. I hope you all live well and prosper, I wish everyone that suffers from mental illness peace and happiness. I hope one day you will all be blessed by life and fortune will smile upon you.

,depression,"So in regards to the title, I dont know what to say.

Honestly school has been pretty much shit ever since I returned to school from distanced learning and probably if it weren't for Covid19 I would be transferring to different field of study or school.  
I like school, I like to learn but some things are pretty awful to force down the throat and usually resurface once school starts.

In context I'm studying graphics and design and we got this class where we just make websites or blender. Teacher gives us websites and things to make and we make them during 7 hours period. This is fine except that particular teacher is lazy with his job in toxic way. 

He gives us a task and then proceeds to turn music to high volume or watch some movies. He is also pretty insecure about his job so he constantly checks on you just to make remarks on your work which often feel irrelevant to the task. And when you actualy want help from him he gets angry yells at you gets into your seat and breaks your code making bloody mess of original problem and note that it still is unsolved. He will then proceed to send you on W3schools and youtube. This isn't that much to get on my mental health yet. Guy actually takes me down in front of teachers/students just for his own laughter. Usually those take downs are not so take downs as I find them stupid and reason with them using my wits even thought its futile but well we got 5 idiots to laugh for it phosho (for sure). Also the work I do there, I find it meaningless as we no longer learn anything, just rinse on actual basics we learnt. I don't even know whether these are basics as rest of things are pretty needed as well. 

I just feel depressed contrary to myself back during remote learning. I started to be cheery, creative, innovative, teamleading and a guy with a goal in mind. That guy got drowned back into water of depression once school started.

,depression,"Hello,I don't know where to start...  I recently achieved something that I used to think would make me happy.  So in this small country, called Lithuania. People here are one of the most suicidal (especially males) in the world.

Everyone is mean, envious, poor.

I have a long history of depression - as a teen I was very skinny, had acne, 0 confidence, braces etc. Last year of high school I weighed 64kg at the height of 191cm. I've attempted suicide during that year, but failed. Had terrible grades, ran intentionally from classes, avoided social interaction. Then I discovered bodybuilding, first time ever witnessed a positive change in myself. By the end of that year I transformed myself, at least mentally, passed exams with flying colors to get free university education.

Got into computer science studies @ 2017. Learned some programming, but quickly realised university is terrible in terms of teaching programming. I went on a gap year, finished a programming course, got a diploma. I was full of happiness.. Until.. It took 20 months to find my first job. 20 months, I shit you not. With a portfolio, a REALLY decent resume (I wouldn't waste time here if that was not true). I got rejected 800 times, was broke all that timeframe, in debt. No social life, no girl friend, no beer, no nothing.

12 months in rejection - waking up every morning just to see push notifications on my phone with 5-15 emails ""thank you, other candidates were better"" I really REALLY broke down. So I decided to turn my sadness into rage. I worked for 7 months straight night in and out learning android. Through a lot of trial and error, struggle I wrote 60-70k lines of code and created a uber-like platform for handyman services. I was getting rejected from job applications through out the 7 month development proccess.This hurt like hell. I could not afford to fix my car through this time, get decent food for bodybuilding ambitions.

My father sells drugs and has been in prison. I had feelings for him for a few years, but due to his manipulative nature and financial/psychological abuse and neglect I broke down. I invested every bit of time to developing programing skills and working minimum wage job is fucking suicidal in this country - people get paid 3 euros an hour, which is like 600eur month - So during this denial of companies of me period I quickly climbed some debt as I took for living expenses.

20months from that diploma of IT courses, I finally got an initial job. The HR bitch unprofesionally laughed when I said i want the lowest sum of money in the job advertisement (just to maximize my chances). I worked for 6 months, witnesseed 7 people getting fired. It was a young ambitiuos Swiss fintech crypto startup with a ruthless CEO. After 6 months I dared to ask for a raise (which was planned by company after 9 months of work) I got fed with some bullshit that I'm young, still a student etc. But I knew my value, I knew fucktards can't be trusted. So I went out job hunting for a week with actual work experience under my belt. In span of 2 weeks, landed a job offer that was double (2k euro month after tax). Then I had to negotiate my way into getting counter offer in my company just to stay, and they were not too keen to provide it.

So, 1 month after raise a German powerhouse IT company finds me. Got headhunted, so as I was satisfied with current financials, decided that I'm gonna ask for maximum salary from the Germans. Which was 5k/month with contract possibility (but our relationship is I am an employee and will work for years), meaning 4k after tax. I accidently got the offer. Negotiated a few hundred extra due to lack of vacation, sick pay etc.

I went to the HR bitch that laughed at me. 1 month after doubling salary I said I think I'm leaving. The bitch is shook. Who's laughing now? :) .  Of course she attempted to feed me bullshit that I won't fit the job position requirements etc etc. But I did not give in.

So. Long story short.

I was broke, living on 200-300eur / month. I destroyed my life. Social life is lost, everything together with it. I thought I was gonna be happy once I achieve my ambitions. I was terribly wrong. I look back, and ask myself, what I was thinking, commiting myself in such suicidal, dangerous matter?

Today I work at Europe's 3rd highest revenue company. Making 4-5x average salary of Lithuania capital city. And I am not happy. I feel money is a terrible trap. I am furiuos because I had years of youth which are fucking wasted, I cannot control my anger, MENTAL health is destroyed, I am impulsive, impatient, untrusting people. I am furiuos that I had a awesome startup idea, it needed money for advertisements to start having purpose. It did got me to where I am, but that is not the point.

I have not been attending university since 2018, like I just go to exams and get rid of them. This is my last year, I am too lazy to write bachelor, I fucking hate hypocritical standpoint of university, ""that it produces valuable employees"" all the fake media shit, it drives me furious. But I negotiated that they would post a media article about my startup app (Still fuck them, this is as much an advertisement for them as it willl be for me.)So, I gave up bodybuilding /powerlifting after depression kicked in. Lost a lot of hard gained weight. I look like fucking shit, slim as a 24 yr old, but stronger than I look on the lifts.

I've never seen a psychologist, due to money problems. I pay my fucking taxes, so I should be entitled to mental help, but the again, it's not the world we live in, is it? Never took any sort of medication, even though I know depression can't be cured WITHOUT medication. I think powerlifting and bodybuilding helped me express the anger, but the amount that flows through me is enough to beat the living shit out of anyone that pisses me off.

I have many startup ideas that I am going to chase, so that's what keeps me alive. The thrill of success, but it must be rapid and massive. Currently own 2 apps. One of them was in 2nd place of trending, raking in 800 downdloads/day at this small country I live in. It comes with a lot of responsibility and knowledge, time commitment to develop things from scratch all alone. It places a lot of stress on me.

I feel guilty as I wasted minimum 20 months of youth chasing money and dreams to find myself unhappy and old.  I've always wanted to find like a cute girlfriend that would accept and understand who I am, never been in a relationship and feel as a loser + guilty at age of 24. Im 24 because I finished school @ 19 and gap year at uni.

To be honest I now get rejected on Tinder like the very same way companies rejected me 800 times until I broke through the ice. I can't take this fucking shit no more. This, that, university fucking tasks that are pathethic and useless.

I also live in a piece of shit apartment outside of town with degenerate neighbours. To be honest it's a box in a factory. I don't pay rent because I did persuade my mother to purchase it when I started studying. It's a one room flat with tragic sound isolation. This place is hell. But I pay 0 for it. Trying to persuade myself to stop saving money and go live a normal life even if that means paying 500-600euro/month for an apartment. It's like im addicted to making maximum money and progress in life, so badly that I feel like a slave.

TDLR

My depression is expressed in anger, cynical thinking, uncontrollable rage rather than weak sadness.

I have become mentally ill. Corrupt. Was once just a sweet young lad, now I broke bad like i'm the devil. More than success, I want to see the envy faces of those who belittled and betryared me, including my father, who left me intentionally, brought me pain and misery.I feel more than money I want power. This scares me. Wanting vengeance more than success. There is nothing wise in this.  


I am tired of eating bodybuilding foods and being limited to looking like shit due to shitty genetics (I have gained 30kg in lifetime of gym). Exhausted of eating piles of food from plastic boxes, seeing on social media how everyone looks normal and is not required to sit at home and force feed themselves. Will probably jump on steroids, because I feel like there's nothing to lose, but living life for a first time seems reasonable. This is EXTREMELY dangerous though with my current state of mind..

The happiness you think money brings is just an illusion. Don't let illusions control you.

I recently achieved something that I used to think would make me happy.  So in this small country, called Lithuania. People here are one of the most suicidal (especially males) in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is mean, envious, poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a long history of depression - as a teen I was very skinny, had acne, 0 confidence, braces etc. Last year of high school I weighed 64kg at the height of 191cm. I&amp;#39;ve attempted suicide during that year, but failed. Had terrible grades, ran intentionally from classes, avoided social interaction. Then I discovered bodybuilding, first time ever witnessed a positive change in myself. By the end of that year I transformed myself, at least mentally, passed exams with flying colors to get free university education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got into computer science studies @ 2017. Learned some programming, but quickly realised university is terrible in terms of teaching programming. I went on a gap year, finished a programming course, got a diploma. I was full of happiness.. Until.. It took 20 months to find my first job. 20 months, I shit you not. With a portfolio, a REALLY decent resume (I wouldn&amp;#39;t waste time here if that was not true). I got rejected 800 times, was broke all that timeframe, in debt. No social life, no girl friend, no beer, no nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 months in rejection - waking up every morning just to see push notifications on my phone with 5-15 emails &amp;quot;thank you, other candidates were better&amp;quot; I really REALLY broke down. So I decided to turn my sadness into rage. I worked for 7 months straight night in and out learning android. Through a lot of trial and error, struggle I wrote 60-70k lines of code and created a uber-like platform for handyman services. I was getting rejected from job applications through out the 7 month development proccess.This hurt like hell. I could not afford to fix my car through this time, get decent food for bodybuilding ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father sells drugs and has been in prison. I had feelings for him for a few years, but due to his manipulative nature and financial/psychological abuse and neglect I broke down. I invested every bit of time to developing programing skills and working minimum wage job is fucking suicidal in this country - people get paid 3 euros an hour, which is like 600eur month - So during this denial of companies of me period I quickly climbed some debt as I took for living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20months from that diploma of IT courses, I finally got an initial job. The HR bitch unprofesionally laughed when I said i want the lowest sum of money in the job advertisement (just to maximize my chances). I worked for 6 months, witnesseed 7 people getting fired. It was a young ambitiuos Swiss fintech crypto startup with a ruthless CEO. After 6 months I dared to ask for a raise (which was planned by company after 9 months of work) I got fed with some bullshit that I&amp;#39;m young, still a student etc. But I knew my value, I knew fucktards can&amp;#39;t be trusted. So I went out job hunting for a week with actual work experience under my belt. In span of 2 weeks, landed a job offer that was double (2k euro month after tax). Then I had to negotiate my way into getting counter offer in my company just to stay, and they were not too keen to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 1 month after raise a German powerhouse IT company finds me. Got headhunted, so as I was satisfied with current financials, decided that I&amp;#39;m gonna ask for maximum salary from the Germans. Which was 5k/month with contract possibility (but our relationship is I am an employee and will work for years), meaning 4k after tax. I accidently got the offer. Negotiated a few hundred extra due to lack of vacation, sick pay etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the HR bitch that laughed at me. 1 month after doubling salary I said I think I&amp;#39;m leaving. The bitch is shook. Who&amp;#39;s laughing now? :) .  Of course she attempted to feed me bullshit that I won&amp;#39;t fit the job position requirements etc etc. But I did not give in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Long story short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was broke, living on 200-300eur / month. I destroyed my life. Social life is lost, everything together with it. I thought I was gonna be happy once I achieve my ambitions. I was terribly wrong. I look back, and ask myself, what I was thinking, commiting myself in such suicidal, dangerous matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I work at Europe&amp;#39;s 3rd highest revenue company. Making 4-5x average salary of Lithuania capital city. And I am not happy. I feel money is a terrible trap. I am furiuos because I had years of youth which are fucking wasted, I cannot control my anger, MENTAL health is destroyed, I am impulsive, impatient, untrusting people. I am furiuos that I had a awesome startup idea, it needed money for advertisements to start having purpose. It did got me to where I am, but that is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not been attending university since 2018, like I just go to exams and get rid of them. This is my last year, I am too lazy to write bachelor, I fucking hate hypocritical standpoint of university, &amp;quot;that it produces valuable employees&amp;quot; all the fake media shit, it drives me furious. But I negotiated that they would post a media article about my startup app (Still fuck them, this is as much an advertisement for them as it willl be for me.)So, I gave up bodybuilding /powerlifting after depression kicked in. Lost a lot of hard gained weight. I look like fucking shit, slim as a 24 yr old, but stronger than I look on the lifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a psychologist, due to money problems. I pay my fucking taxes, so I should be entitled to mental help, but the again, it&amp;#39;s not the world we live in, is it? Never took any sort of medication, even though I know depression can&amp;#39;t be cured WITHOUT medication. I think powerlifting and bodybuilding helped me express the anger, but the amount that flows through me is enough to beat the living shit out of anyone that pisses me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many startup ideas that I am going to chase, so that&amp;#39;s what keeps me alive. The thrill of success, but it must be rapid and massive. Currently own 2 apps. One of them was in 2nd place of trending, raking in 800 downdloads/day at this small country I live in. It comes with a lot of responsibility and knowledge, time commitment to develop things from scratch all alone. It places a lot of stress on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty as I wasted minimum 20 months of youth chasing money and dreams to find myself unhappy and old.  I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to find like a cute girlfriend that would accept and understand who I am, never been in a relationship and feel as a loser + guilty at age of 24. Im 24 because I finished school @ 19 and gap year at uni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I now get rejected on Tinder like the very same way companies rejected me 800 times until I broke through the ice. I can&amp;#39;t take this fucking shit no more. This, that, university fucking tasks that are pathethic and useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also live in a piece of shit apartment outside of town with degenerate neighbours. To be honest it&amp;#39;s a box in a factory. I don&amp;#39;t pay rent because I did persuade my mother to purchase it when I started studying. It&amp;#39;s a one room flat with tragic sound isolation. This place is hell. But I pay 0 for it. Trying to persuade myself to stop saving money and go live a normal life even if that means paying 500-600euro/month for an apartment. It&amp;#39;s like im addicted to making maximum money and progress in life, so badly that I feel like a slave.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I liked to think that I'm a usually extraverted person. I didn't have problems talking business with strangers nor did I ever feel self-consious in crowds. This hasn't been a case since like some time. Like I started stuttering and lost all communication skills I had suddenly.  

Now I acknowledge I'm lazy, i don't have motivation to do things if there isn't competition, but ever since COVID (especiallyfrom October 2020) I've been feeling really down. Sad, guilt, tension and anxiety consume me. I skipped classes except for biology cuz I never really felt like studying online, could never concentrate. As a result, I think I did really bad in exams. Back to the point, I registered for a college that's not in my city and as a result, had to study online for 2 fucking years in a room alone, by myself, with just books and a screen for long 13-14 hour stretches. I would see my old school friends enjoying with their friends from new college (they registered in the same city so they went offline again shortly after some lockdown restrictions were lifted in March 2021).  

No one really called me, or tried to catch up, except for my best friend who did once(which I'm really thankful for). So in turn, I didn't really call them either because I'm a pussy.  

I've lost all interest and whenever I try to concentrate on anything, bad old memories resurface, I act irritated because of which ppl around me (my mom in particular) have said I'm arrogant, rude and it always feels like I radiate negativity. I don't really wanna tell them all this because I'm afraid their first reaction will be getting mad that I skipped classes (which they're correct for).  

I also don't feel like sleeping, even changed my sleep schedule like 14 times over 2 years and my diet is little but i eat a lot of chocolates cuz ppl say they can keep you happy. Tho I didn't really gain weight.

All I want is to be able to concentrate and be like i once used to be, productive and someone ppl think radiates positivity because it's all really draining on my mind. I did consider self-harm but i know better so that's never happening. I just wanna fight this. Not feel this way. I'm afraid of consequences of not studying, and that itself makes me less productive, that lingering tension whenever I sit on the desk to study. I just want to be free, happy, i don't wanna feel like a burden. I just wanna live like a reliable dude.

I didn&amp;#39;t have problems talking business with strangers nor did I ever feel self-consious in crowds. This hasn&amp;#39;t been a case since like some time. Like I started stuttering and lost all communication skills I had suddenly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I acknowledge I&amp;#39;m lazy, i don&amp;#39;t have motivation to do things if there isn&amp;#39;t competition, but ever since COVID (especiallyfrom October 2020) I&amp;#39;ve been feeling really down. Sad, guilt, tension and anxiety consume me. I skipped classes except for biology cuz I never really felt like studying online, could never concentrate. As a result, I think I did really bad in exams. Back to the point, I registered for a college that&amp;#39;s not in my city and as a result, had to study online for 2 fucking years in a room alone, by myself, with just books and a screen for long 13-14 hour stretches. I would see my old school friends enjoying with their friends from new college (they registered in the same city so they went offline again shortly after some lockdown restrictions were lifted in March 2021).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really called me, or tried to catch up, except for my best friend who did once(which I&amp;#39;m really thankful for). So in turn, I didn&amp;#39;t really call them either because I&amp;#39;m a pussy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost all interest and whenever I try to concentrate on anything, bad old memories resurface, I act irritated because of which ppl around me (my mom in particular) have said I&amp;#39;m arrogant, rude and it always feels like I radiate negativity. I don&amp;#39;t really wanna tell them all this because I&amp;#39;m afraid their first reaction will be getting mad that I skipped classes (which they&amp;#39;re correct for).  &lt;/p&gt;

Ever since I was young, my brother's have been a massive issue. I grew up with a brother on the autism spectrum who was extremely violent to where he would punch holes in the wall and threaten to kill me all the time. One day he almost did. My other brother would put my other brother in a headlock and beat the shit out of him to stop him from being violent. Then there's me, having to grow up with that. Growing up I was always physically abused. In school I was severely bullied and my bullies genuinely tried to end my life and the teachers sat there and did nothing to stop it. It went on for a year when I finally had to switch schools because I would avoid school as much as possible. Then a couple years later when my 12th birthday finally hit, that was the last day I saw my dad. He didn't want to pay child support and abandoned me on my birthday. I haven't celebrated my birthday since. After that, more bullying, had to switch schools again.

,depression,"Since gaining consciousness, I've felt trapped. Nothing felt right about me. I have never been happy with myself. I try to act happy and joyful, because I know I don't deserve to feel that way. Every time I make someone happy, that happiness vanishes as soon as I feel it because I know this is just luck and I'm not capable of doing it. Sorry, my first language is not English, so I have a hard time finding the right words to put in the sentence. I feel like I was created to be made fun of. It makes sense because humiliation is one of my biggest fears, so it's more fun if I get made fun of. It hurts a lot, but I don't share anything that happens to me, because it's not worth anyone's time and energy. I have trapped myself in many things. My feelings are like a prison, my house is like a prison, my school is like a prison, everything is not right for me.

 

The worst thing about me is that I never lose hope, but I give up easily, so I make excuses for myself that things will go alright even though I do nothing. I have a bad attention span and a weak memory. I do everything wrong, even though I don't mean to mess up things, but I eventually do. All I want is to feel useful. All I want is just some kind of respect. Sharing my problems and emotions scares me because I think they are stupid, and I'm sure most of them are. I don't respect anyone or anything because I don't want to because I myself never got it. That's the next thing I hate about myself.

 

I'm selfish and I can't change it. I really don't want to be selfish, but it's my nature. No matter how much I try, I always fail. I just want to help people as much as I possibly can because I know what it feels like to not have someone to help you in need. I can't speak properly. Sometimes I can't say words that I have been saying for years properly. Everyone makes fun of me. For this reason, I don't want to talk to anyone. 

 

I'm really tall for my age. I mean, I am taller than most of the kids in my class, and I hate being this big. It just makes me a bigger target. I really really wish I was normal size, so fewer people would notice me, and even fewer people would know how stupid I am. I've never really had a true friend. I feel like the ones I have are just using me. My life is like that. I want to be alone, but I never am. I want to end my life, but I have hope that one day everything will turn upside down and my life will be happier, but what if it doesn't happen? What if I live to be old and realise that I was right and I should have ended it right here? Death is painful, and so is life. My life is dreadful for me. I don't know if I have depression. I don't know my problem.

***Original Post***

I    have diagnosed MDD, severe  anxiety and PTSD. Although I was  diagnosed   with MDD at the age of 9, i  was showing symptoms even  before then.

**I'm     at peace with this decision. I don't want sympathy, I don't want any    of  that. I also don't want people to try to talk me out of it. I  just   want people to talk to. I've never gotten anything in  life, so I  hope   that a few people will fulfill this dying wish.  Hopefully I can  find a   few other people that suffer from depression as  well, and  maybe I can   help somebody before I leave this world behind.**

My     entire life has been nothing but shit. I was born to an abusive and     alcoholic father, a psychotic mother, an overzealous grandmother, a     grandfather in the Klan, and an uncle who was just completely crazy.

The     older that I got, the worse that things became. My dad would hit me    and  call me horrific things, so to escape this reality, I got into     computers at just three years old, and this has been my escape until     recently.

At the age of six years     old, I started getting heavily bullied in school. I've always been a     kind and charitable person, and people either took advantage of me   until   I had nothing left to give them, or I was bullied violently by   other   kids.

My dad would do   really bad   things to me, he hit me in the head with a bad (age 9),   used his car to   tear down my treehouse (also age 9), chase me around   the house with a  BB  gun (age 10), try to stab me multiple times (age   11) on top of a lot  of  other things.

The   house my  dad  lived in was right next door and owned by my   grandparents. They  were  blind to everything that he did to me, said   his alcoholism and  drug  addiction was a sickness, and did everything   they could to  encourage  him, while ignoring all of my pleas for help   or even going as  far as to  punish me for telling them what he did to   me.

The   school system just   pretended they didn't even have a bullying problem   in their schools,   telling everybody I made it up because I had ADHD and   an overactive   imagination, going as far as to force me into special   needs classes in   the 7th and 8th grade.

Mom   ran   away from home when I was five and left me to fend all by myself.    When  I was 14, my mom took my dad to court over visitation rights, won    the  right to visit me, and basically kidnapped me after visiting her   the   second time. My mom, as I said, was psychotic, and my stepdad was     abusive just like my dad was. He didn't get quite as violent as my  real    dad did, but where my dad would only beat me when he was drunk,  my    stepdad would beat me constantly, saying I needed to 'toughen up'  and    shit like that.

However,  during    that time, I met my first and only ex. I met a girl there and  talked to    her for a few weeks before we started dating. I've always  been  Asexual,   but I've also always craved a relationship. Something  where I  can make   my partner breakfast in bed when they're sick, smack  them in  the head   with a pillow when they're not looking, build  pillow/blanket  forts  with,  watch cute shows for hours on end, etc.

We     dated for around three weeks. She held my hand, would pat my head,    play  with my hair, call me stupid and cute names, and even kissed me    one  time. A few weeks later, though, she just randomly came out and    said she  didn't want to date me anymore, and had found somebody else. I    was  traumatized by that, but my brain was still developing, so I    wasn't as  mentally fucked by it as I would have been later.

I     moved home when I was 15 and the same thing with my real dad started     again. I even had to drop out of my Senior year, because my sister   went   to prison, my dad had to take care of him, and I had to protect   my   two-year-old nephew from my dad when he blacked out. I'm a   pacifist, so   it usually involved him just kicking the shit out of me,   but it kept my   nephew alive, so I'd gladly do it again.

When     I was 17, my ex had been in a horrible car accident, and was   diagnosed   with Amnesia. However, I didn't find out until I was 20. I   added her  on  Facebook, told her who I was (she didn't remember me,   duh) and we  got  along great. After about a month of talking, she said   she needed a  new  computer to work from home, as this was the height  of  the vee-rus  (don't  want to get autoblocked for saying the word).  At  first, I went  to a guy  I frequented for computer parts on eBay,  but he  was out of  stock of  prebuilt computers at the time. So, of  course,  with me being  an absolute  moron, I said if she could drive  the hour to  come see me,  she could  have mine. She came and got it, we  talked for  around fifteen  minutes,  and she left.

The   very  next day,  she messaged me on Facebook, said that I was a   manipulative  psychopath,  and blocked me on everything. That pretty   much caused a  downward spiral  that I never truly came back from. Up   until that time, I  had spent my  life hoping I would find a   relationship, or even a  friendship (my  friendships never lasted for   more than two weeks, half  of the time  because they stabbed me in the   back, other half because  nobody ever  taught me how to talk to people).   After that, I just  started hoping that  maybe, just *maybe*, humanity wasn't as bad as I thought.

Then..     The thing in the east happened (word filter, so I'll give you a  hint,    it starts with Book Rain), and everybody showed just how much  of a    psychopath they were as a result, so I've just decided to..  Quit.

I'm    at peace with this  decision. I've already got everything planned out.    It will take  several weeks to get the handgun I ordered, but I've    already planned  it out in detail and length. I have no friends. I have    no family. The  only person that would know I was even gone would be my    employer,  and he would just assume I quit because my job completely    sucks.  Nobody will care when I'm gone, and the way that I've planned out    my  departure from this world, nobody will be traumatized by my death     either.

***New Post***

(1)

In    the past 1-2 weeks, I have gone through the proper channels to   purchase  a handgun, and have it delivered to a licensed FFL. (FFA? LFF?   LHF?  Something like that). The gun was actually delivered on Friday.   The  problem is, I do not have a Handgun Purchase Permit, or a  Concealed   Carry Permit yet. Either one of the two are required to  actually go  and  pick up the handgun I purchased.

I    lied on the website and told them that I had one, but I need physical    proof to actually go and retrieve it. I don't know how long they'll   hold  onto it for me, because I haven't called them or anything since   Friday.

(2)

One    thing that I have noticed is that the vast majority of people on   Reddit  have called all of this fake, and most of those people have even   gone  through to message me things such as ""follow through, pussy :)"",   ""no  balls"", ""cope"", and just other childish/vile shit. I'd say that  out  of  all of the people that have gone out of their way to message  me,  80% of  the people were messaging me things like that.

If    you've noticed, the previous posts are also gone. This is because the    hatred was starting to spill into the actual posts themselves, and no    matter how nice I was about it, every time I replied, I got a  response   similar to ""Fuck you"". One person actually went as far as  having the   police sent to my house for a welfare check. Figuring out  that I   probably had something revealing on my profile, I got a browser    extension to delete every single one of my posts and comments. The  last   few days have been nothing but me posting pictures of cars  because I'm   bored and have nothing else to do.

(3)

The    plan has pretty much stayed the same. The day that I get the handgun,  I   will let everybody that has been messaging me know that I have    retrieved it. I will also donate all of my money except for $50 to    charities. I have around $7,000 in my bank account. I won't donate    anything from credit.

The night    after, at around 3AM, I will drive about half of an hour away from my    home, to this highway section that has a bridge looking over a massive    river. I will park the car about a mile down the highway, walk the mile    back, and sit there for a while. I will check my phone to make sure   that  there are no people I have missed with the explanation, and I will   say  my final goodbyes. A lot of people have asked to be informed when   my  time has come, and I will fulfill this final wish.

Waiting    for no cars to be on the highway, I will lean over the edge, and pop    myself. I will fall off of the bridge, into the river, never to be  seen   again. Nobody has to be traumatized, nobody even has to know. The  only   family I have left is my uncle, who I haven't seen in a long  time, and I   had mentioned to him in the past that I was trying to  settle down in   Germany, so he will assume that's where I went (for  context, I live in   the United States).

(4)

Posting    the last post caused a lot of anger, so I will attempt to resolve  this   as best as I can, since the vast majority of people thought that I  was   posting this for attention, or for help. I will explain again  that I  am  at peace with this decision, and that I do not want  attention. The   people are keeping me occupied so that I don't go  insane, but nobody's   getting attached to me, which is exactly what I  wanted.

The   main reason for  these posts is to let other depressed people out there   know that they  are not alone. That they may be able to compare things   from their  lives to my own. However, instead of encouraging others to   follow the  same path that I am, I am here to show those people that they   have  reasons to live. If they don't, I can help them find reasons. So   far, I  have helped exactly 20 people, in DMs and private messages. The   goal I  would be content with was one, but since I've helped 20,   hopefully I  can help 200 more before my time comes.

(Summary)

I    will be reading any comments and responding to them in the best way    that I possibly can. I'll be on for at least a few hours, and will    respond to comments in the order in which they came.",t2_imc9gnhw,False,,0,False,"A little over a week ago, I made a post going in-depth of why I have decided to commit unalive.

,depression,"TRIGGER WARNING: For pretty much everything except for sexual abuse

So right off the bat, this is probably going to be long. So please bear with me; I’m not entirely sure what my point in posting this actually is. I guess I’m just trying to see what other people think and what they have to say on my experiences? Someone who can understand and empathize with my specific predicament and offer some much needed insight or something?

Now, a few things about me:
I was born in the early 90’s out in the sticks (relatively speaking). From the day I was born, I was plagued by medical issues. I had aggressive tumors around my spine, I had to have two back surgery to remove the tumors before I was even 2 years old (they grew back after the first surgery). I was also born with eyes so bad, had I not gotten proper treatment, I’d have eventually gone blind. After many problems in elementary school with classmates and teachers alike, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. It was so bad the doctors told my mom I’d be lucky to even be able to tie my own shoes as an adult;  and despite the fact that I live with chronic pain from my surgeries,  the autism has, bar none, been the single hardest part of my life. Let me explain. 

Growing up, my parents (though mostly my mother in context of this conversation) taught me many things. She helped me overcome and manage meltdowns by learning how to break down events that happened each day: at school, or at the store, or wherever we were, so I could work to understand what had happened to make me act the way I did and develop strategies to not let it bother me so bad and be better next time a similar situation would arise so I could function in normal society. 

She’s helped me grow to be strong and independent, but along the way, whether it was something she taught me directly, or if it was just something I picked up on from my surroundings, but from a very early age I knew that my condition was something to hide and keep secret from others. Something to only share with people whom you know can be trusted (and in this instance strangers on the Internet who (hopefully) pose no threat to me or my anonymity and privacy). Though, knowing my mother; it’s probably fair to assume that’s something else she taught me, to not let others know what was ‘wrong’ with me.

My father was only around on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) because he drove truck across the country; but even when he was home he would spend his time catching up on chores around the house, mowing our grass, going to my grandparents and mowing their several acres with them, catch up on sleep, relax. I can’t say I remember ever getting any real ‘play’ time, we’d spend time together when he was home watching TV together or I’d be playing by myself (also I’m an only child and I grew up in a neighborhood full of people in their 50’s and up whereas my parents were in their late twenties and early thirties, so there were no other kids in my area to speak of). My dad will admit as much today, but he didn’t really do much to ‘help’ me growing up, “that was all his mother” he’d say. Still, growing up, and even to this day he’s the ‘fun’ parent, he would come home from the road and bring me different things, and even to this day he’ll split scratch off ticket winnings with me and a bunch of other stuff like that. 

Though I would try to talk to both my parents about my problems, my dad would say something like “making friends gets easier as you get older.” Or he would give me ‘clever comebacks’, like next time someone calls me r*****ed say something like: let’s compare report cards and we’ll see who the r***** is’ - things that never worked when I’d try them. And my mom would tell me something like “you’re a big boy and big boys don’t cry”, or “each day is a fresh start.” She would especially try to emphasize this “fresh start” concept after summer break was coming to a close. 

I would spend a good chunk of my summers with my dad on the road, we went all over the country together; I’ve seen all but two states before I was 10, I got to see the world trade centers before 9/11, I’ve seen the Grand Canyon, I’ve seen the oceans on both sides of this country. It’s given me a great appreciation for just how big the world is and how small I am, and an incredible love for various cultures around the world and a deep desire to travel to experience them. 

Sadly, the summers never lasted forever, and eventually I’d need to go back to school. The “fresh start” my mom would preach to me every year back would prove to be wrong, each and every year, no matter how I try to get along with others, no matter how I’d try to reinvent myself or talk and act like everyone else to hopefully fit in, none of it mattered because I’m still ‘the freak’, ‘the alien’,  an ‘it’ rather than a ‘he’, and starting in middle school: ‘the r****d’, and ‘the f****t’ joined the roster of insults and names, even though I’m straight and dated girls in middle and high school. 

Now even though I kept my condition under wraps at school, not telling anyone, I seemingly didn’t need to tell anyone for them to all know there was something ‘off’ about me, and that something ‘wasn’t quite right’ with me. Try as I might, from the time I entered preschool, and almost all the way through elementary school, I was unable to make a single friend until I was 10 &amp; was already in the 5th grade. Up until then people either wanted nothing to do with me, or they were practically torturing me; no one cared, no one stood up for me, no one wanted to be my friend. 

I consider myself to have been essentially, completely alone for those first ten years of my life. The only people who kinda treated me right were my family, but aside from my grandmother, they all have no problem hitting and yelling and even screaming at me when I stepped out of line or they’d had enough: of  me, my ‘attitude’, or my ‘problems’ (autistic behavior). My dad even made a wooden paddle (with holes for your butt fat and everything) for my mom to hit me with when he was away during the week and unable to discipline me himself. 

Growing up in that environment, I started to wonder if the only reason my family ‘loved’ me was because we share blood and they are ‘obligated’ to love me. I felt like THE ENTIRE WORLD was against me, it even started to make me wonder: if god is real, why would he force me to live such a lonely and painful existence? The more I thought about this I realized that it’s only through human progression and advancements in the fields of science and medicine that are responsible for me being alive. If it had been up to ‘god’ - or another way of looking at it: the natural order of the world, without our interference; I would have likely died in infancy, just as ‘god’ intended. Now, I’m not a religious person, I’m agnostic; but it’s an interesting thought/observation for a child to come to in terms of the paradoxical nature of their existence; it’s quite the weight to bear from such a young age!

I could sit here and painfully recollect every thing that has been done to me by family members, fellow students, teachers, principals, babysitters, ‘friends’, coworkers, and even people I never directly interact with; seemingly every which direction I can think of short of the church (we never went and when I asked my mom about it once she said if anyone asked to just say we’re Protestant). I could list them all, but I’ll just pick a few of the ones that are especially vibrant in my memory, I’ll also try to go in some rough chronological order.

Now, I’m not sure if any of what I’m about to talk about is ‘traumatic’, because how does one go about defining what exactly is and is not ‘traumatic’? (Serious question, because I’m so emotionally disconnected/inept and idk if that’s my upbringing or my autism or a mix of the two that I have no idea how to tell) Idk how to say if something is traumatic; though I’ll usually belittle and disregard the idea in others when they say something is traumatic. I’ll say they’re being dramatic, or just ‘no it’s not’; but that’s mostly because I’ve been raised to ‘be tough’, and to me, people carrying on about how something is/was ‘traumatic’, and making a public display of it; idk it’s like they’re admitting to being weak. Which, if they had any sense they would realize is a bad idea because it invites others to kick you while you’re down. 

In pre-school, someone was celebrating their birthday with a pinyata; I had never seen one of these before, and I was unaware of what to do or what the ‘rules’ were about it. I managed to get a turn, it didn’t break, another kid got it opened; and when all the candy fell on the floor, I guess I assumed everyone would be nice and neat and orderly and things would get handed out. Naturally it was a bare-knuckle-free-for-all between about 20-25 four year olds. What did I do? I stood there, frozen, confused, unable to process what was happening; by the time I realized I could be doing the same as them, almost all the candy had been grabbed. I tried to grab something but I wasn’t quick enough and I ended up with nothing. I know this story sounds like it should be nothing, and in the grander scheme of things it is quite insignificant; but this is one of the earliest memories I have of something bad happening because of my autism and I think it sets the tone for what my life is. I was always a very sensitive child growing up, and this deeply upset me. I ended up crying at my desk, no one, not even the teachers offered to share or felt bad for me. I learned if I missed out when everyone else got theirs, then too bad for me; that’s my fault, do better next time. 

My mother would try to tell me “you’re a big boy now, and big boys don’t cry”, so more often than not I’d end up having an incident with another kid and would end up crying in a corner telling myself the same thing: “you’re a big boy, big boys don’t cry”, desperately trying to calm myself down. I always hated crying, I hated being sensitive, I hated being weak, I hated that being weak only made everyone want to hurt me more. I had to get stronger, I had to be better, I must learn how not to cry. Each day when I’d have a meltdown and start crying I’d try different methods to keep myself from crying; once I was able to abate my tears by not breathing; it made me so happy to have some sense of control over my emotions. I needed to get stronger, I needed to stop crying, I needed to stop being so sensitive so that others wouldn’t feel so inclined to treat me the way they did. I had to be ‘normal’, I would study my tormentors, see how they interact amongst themselves and how they treated me; and I would try to unravel the mysteries of how ‘normal’ people act and think. 

In preschool and elementary school, no one would want to play with me or allow me to play in their group (the soul exception was kick ball, but that didn’t even last a year before they didn’t want me playing with them anymore either). I got transferred around to several different schools throughout the early years, probably no less than 3 schools before 5th grade, but everywhere I went it was the same. 

I’d usually spend recess alone reading in the shade, one school had a pine tree I loved to sit under and read, but when the teachers found out I was hanging out there they told me I couldn’t go there anymore because ‘they couldn’t see me’ over there, a valid excuse, but you know where I am and you should know I’m trying to avoid the other students and enjoy myself. If I try to read up nearer the school everyone will see me and start harassing me, asking what I’m reading, taking it from me, refusing to give it back, destroying it, etc. 

In first or second grade, we had a bathroom in the corner of our classroom. One day when I went to use it, I had to poop. Something about me: I’ve suffered from chronic constipation my whole life, so it took me a while. When I got out, the teacher dragged me to the front of the classroom and screamed at me (she tried to ask me the question a couple of times and I didn’t answer because I was embarrassed, so she’d raise her voice until she was eventually  screaming at me) “what were you doing in there!?” To which I could only answer honestly, through tears streaming down my face at the humiliation “I was pooping”, and the entire class burst out into laughter and I was allowed to go back to my seat where I tried to forget I existed for the rest of the day. This gave me problems for decades when it came to using public restrooms, something I’ve only recently gotten over. 

In elementary school; when I was in gym class one day, our teachers took us outside to play baseball. I knew enough about baseball to know you need to hit the ball and run to your bases without getting out; but what I was clueless on was the line forming etiquette. 

At this point my low standing on the social hierarchy had been well established already, so of course I get pushed to the back of the line after I was picked last. I’m fine with this, as long as everyone keeps their order I’ll slowly advance and get my turn to swing; the other team gets enough outs, we switch, same deal, switch back; but no one is maintaining the original line position, and again I get shoved to the back of the line. This repeats, over and over again until class is over. At this point I’m furious, I try to tell the teacher through tears how I’ve been keeping track and literally every other person got a turn to swing except for me. The teacher didn’t care, I’m dumbfounded; so I throw a fit saying I’m not leaving the field until I get my turn, the teacher laughs and says ‘ok have fun’ and leads the class back inside the building, leaving me alone on the field, crying. Not one person spoke up for me, no one wanted to help me feel better, no one cared; something you may have already picked up on, but it’s a bit of a theme in my life it seems. 

Ive had 2 babysitters smack me around. I can’t say why the one did it, but the one did it because I accidentally rode into his leg with my bike. Now from my perspective back then, I saw I was coming straight at him and I wanted to stop, but in a moment of panic, I completely forgot how to stop.

In middle school, I had a rare instance of a good day in which I didn’t get into any fights or trouble at school. I was riding the bus on my way back to my babysitters, and I honestly can’t remember what happened on the bus-if anything; but 3 kids followed me off the bus and waited until we were away from the main roads and started chucking rocks at me, several of them left bruises, but a few broke the skin. I was bleeding from the head by the time I got to my babysitters house. What did I do while they were pelting me with stones? Nothing, I just kept walking, I had such a ‘good’ day, and I didn’t want to ‘ruin’ it by getting in trouble at the last minute. To this day my mom still has the pictures she took of me with my face covered in my own blood. 

Many times over the years after incidents like this, I brought up the idea of suing the people that did things to me, or the teachers and schools for allowing it to happen (i know because the rocks happened outside of school there’s nothing they could have done) but I was always shot down, being told something along the lines of ‘everyone’s going around suing each other these days, we’re not like that.’ I can still remember coming home from pre-school and elementary school pretty much every day, running, crying to my room and screaming about how “I wish I were dead”; luckily as a child I had no idea how to commit suicide, otherwise I’d have likely had an attempt or two under my belt.

That same babysitter (from the stone story) my mother and I would end up finding dead one morning. My mom brought me over to drop me off and she wasn’t answering the door, so my mom managed to ‘break in’ and found her dead on her bed. By this point in my life (this would have probably been early to mid middle school) I was already so jaded from my life’s experiences and so numb I was more or less unbothered by her death. I remember my mom crying saying she wishes she could make me understand death, I understood she was gone and we’d never see her again, but I also figured we were never super close; she’d watch me for 30 minutes or less before the bus would grab me and I’d hang out there and watch TV in a separate room while waiting for mom to get off work. So she was never someone who was super important or special in my life. I was actually kind of jealous, her suffering was over (she was on morphine because of a metal plate she had in her head), she no longer had to deal with the suffering that comes with living; I couldn’t be sad about that. 

When I was in high school, I also attended a vo-tech center; on the bus ride to vo-tech one day, this kid I wasn’t paying any attention to or interacting with thought it would be ‘funny’ to choke me out from behind. He eventually let go, but I grabbed his arm and put it back around my neck, begging him to finish what he started; much to my disappointment, he didn’t oblige. 

I had almost all the guys in my gym class once think it would be ‘funny’ to dog-pile on me, I was about to pass out when the teacher decided enough was enough and made everyone get off as I desperately gasped ‘help! I can’t breathe!’. I’m sure if I hadn’t spoken up they would have let it continue until I passed out, or worse.

I kept telling myself ‘I just need to make it through 12 years, then I’m out of here and I’ll never have to see these people again’. Graduation day came and went, my last responsibility and obligation free summer quickly came and passed before my first day of college. Finally, an actual, real fresh start. Somewhere where no one knows me, I figure my ‘reputation’ was permanently sullied at my old school, but all my years of learning how to interact through painful trial and error were finally going to pay off. No longer would I be a ‘r****d’, I’d be ‘normal’, just like everyone else and never again would people be so cruel or hateful towards me for being different. My life was about to get exponentially better and I couldn’t be more excited. 

I struggled to make friends in college, and a few people still thought I was extremely weird or even outright hated me; but here I wasn’t bullied, assaulted, or harassed; I’m just not included in things, I’m isolated. I manage to make a few friends; each week two of the kids (brothers) who hate me would host a LAN party to play video games, I’m always interested, but I learned a long time ago from trying to include myself in things, if I’m not invited, it’s best to assume I’m not wanted; and naturally I was never invited. Any time I’d try to invite or include myself in a groups fun I’d get told to get lost, no one likes me, how I should kill myself, etc. Not until the last week or so of college, I get randomly invited to the last LAN party at lunch. Being told I’m welcome to come and ‘the more the merrier’. 

I attend the party, I think all is going well, I’m friends with some of these kids, not so much with others, but I think I may have found a group, a cliche, somewhere I belong. We all get hungry and go out to Steak and Shake; while we’re eating, i can’t remember what I said, i thought we were all having a good time, my best friends gf (at the time, ex now) says “You know what anon, you have got to be, THE, CREEPIEST, MOTHERF****R, I’ve ever met in my life! We had been around each other a couple of times before then so I thought we were all good. But when she made that declaration, no one; not even my best friend, stood up to defend me…my soul was crushed, I took her outburst and their silence to speak to a general consensus and agreement. Despite my 12 years of suffering and training to learn how to interact like a normal person; after all that, I still get told how much of a creep I am. Have all my years of suffering been pointless? Is this just what existence is meant to be for me? For my kind? I don’t know what I did in my last life to earn so much negative karma, I dont understand what I’ve done to deserve such a fate. 

Since college, I’ve had a few similar instances at different places I’ve worked. I’ve had more than a couple of instances at places I’ve worked where people felt they had to tell me what a creep I am. I’ve been told I ‘look like’ a school shooter, a pedo, a f****t, a r****d, etc; just for trying to make friends with the people I find myself surrounded by. No matter what I do, it seems impossible for me to win; this just seems to be my lot in life: struggling desperately to make connections to others so as not to be alone, only to be nearly universally rejected and told how I’m still weird and that no one likes me. 

The conditions surrounding my life, the way others have treated me, and my perception of my life, have all culminated in the person I am now. 

I’ve worked so hard, all my life, to try and be ‘normal’, so that I can fit in to the world around me. I’ve taken every strong feeling I ever had and systematically shoved it down into a deep, dark corner of my mind. Because ultimately I’ve learned that the majority of humans don’t care and will actively work to make things worse if they know something bothers you. 

Because; my entire life, my existence has seemed paradoxical. 

Like I was born into a world I was never meant for. If it wasn't for modern medicine and doctors, the condition I was born in, would have proven fatal at any other point in human history. 

Every time I tried to make friends growing up it was met with failure, rejection, and ridicule. It just seems like everyone, including god, has been against me from the beginning, like I was never meant to live for more than a few months.

I guess it just seems natural given the circumstances, that I am punished for living when I wasn't supposed to; like this is what you get when you go against the natural order of the universe. 

I don’t know if anyone else has faced similar circumstances, if anyone out there can relate, empathize with me, if anyone feels similarly; if anyone can prove me wrong, that humans aren’t evil by nature: willing to jump on anyone they feel they have an advantage over, anyone they view as someone less.

It was so bad the doctors told my mom I’d be lucky to even be able to tie my own shoes as an adult;  and despite the fact that I live with chronic pain from my surgeries,  the autism has, bar none, been the single hardest part of my life. Let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, my parents (though mostly my mother in context of this conversation) taught me many things. She helped me overcome and manage meltdowns by learning how to break down events that happened each day: at school, or at the store, or wherever we were, so I could work to understand what had happened to make me act the way I did and develop strategies to not let it bother me so bad and be better next time a similar situation would arise so I could function in normal society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s helped me grow to be strong and independent, but along the way, whether it was something she taught me directly, or if it was just something I picked up on from my surroundings, but from a very early age I knew that my condition was something to hide and keep secret from others. Something to only share with people whom you know can be trusted (and in this instance strangers on the Internet who (hopefully) pose no threat to me or my anonymity and privacy). Though, knowing my mother; it’s probably fair to assume that’s something else she taught me, to not let others know what was ‘wrong’ with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was only around on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) because he drove truck across the country; but even when he was home he would spend his time catching up on chores around the house, mowing our grass, going to my grandparents and mowing their several acres with them, catch up on sleep, relax. I can’t say I remember ever getting any real ‘play’ time, we’d spend time together when he was home watching TV together or I’d be playing by myself (also I’m an only child and I grew up in a neighborhood full of people in their 50’s and up whereas my parents were in their late twenties and early thirties, so there were no other kids in my area to speak of). My dad will admit as much today, but he didn’t really do much to ‘help’ me growing up, “that was all his mother” he’d say. Still, growing up, and even to this day he’s the ‘fun’ parent, he would come home from the road and bring me different things, and even to this day he’ll split scratch off ticket winnings with me and a bunch of other stuff like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I would try to talk to both my parents about my problems, my dad would say something like “making friends gets easier as you get older.” Or he would give me ‘clever comebacks’, like next time someone calls me r**&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ed say something like: let’s compare report cards and we’ll see who the r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;** is’ - things that never worked when I’d try them. And my mom would tell me something like “you’re a big boy and big boys don’t cry”, or “each day is a fresh start.” She would especially try to emphasize this “fresh start” concept after summer break was coming to a close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would spend a good chunk of my summers with my dad on the road, we went all over the country together; I’ve seen all but two states before I was 10, I got to see the world trade centers before 9/11, I’ve seen the Grand Canyon, I’ve seen the oceans on both sides of this country. It’s given me a great appreciation for just how big the world is and how small I am, and an incredible love for various cultures around the world and a deep desire to travel to experience them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the summers never lasted forever, and eventually I’d need to go back to school. The “fresh start” my mom would preach to me every year back would prove to be wrong, each and every year, no matter how I try to get along with others, no matter how I’d try to reinvent myself or talk and act like everyone else to hopefully fit in, none of it mattered because I’m still ‘the freak’, ‘the alien’,  an ‘it’ rather than a ‘he’, and starting in middle school: ‘the r*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;d’, and ‘the f&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*t’ joined the roster of insults and names, even though I’m straight and dated girls in middle and high school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now even though I kept my condition under wraps at school, not telling anyone, I seemingly didn’t need to tell anyone for them to all know there was something ‘off’ about me, and that something ‘wasn’t quite right’ with me. Try as I might, from the time I entered preschool, and almost all the way through elementary school, I was unable to make a single friend until I was 10 &amp;amp; was already in the 5th grade. Up until then people either wanted nothing to do with me, or they were practically torturing me; no one cared, no one stood up for me, no one wanted to be my friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself to have been essentially, completely alone for those first ten years of my life. The only people who kinda treated me right were my family, but aside from my grandmother, they all have no problem hitting and yelling and even screaming at me when I stepped out of line or they’d had enough: of  me, my ‘attitude’, or my ‘problems’ (autistic behavior). My dad even made a wooden paddle (with holes for your butt fat and everything) for my mom to hit me with when he was away during the week and unable to discipline me himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in that environment, I started to wonder if the only reason my family ‘loved’ me was because we share blood and they are ‘obligated’ to love me. I felt like THE ENTIRE WORLD was against me, it even started to make me wonder: if god is real, why would he force me to live such a lonely and painful existence? The more I thought about this I realized that it’s only through human progression and advancements in the fields of science and medicine that are responsible for me being alive. If it had been up to ‘god’ - or another way of looking at it: the natural order of the world, without our interference; I would have likely died in infancy, just as ‘god’ intended. Now, I’m not a religious person, I’m agnostic; but it’s an interesting thought/observation for a child to come to in terms of the paradoxical nature of their existence; it’s quite the weight to bear from such a young age!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could sit here and painfully recollect every thing that has been done to me by family members, fellow students, teachers, principals, babysitters, ‘friends’, coworkers, and even people I never directly interact with; seemingly every which direction I can think of short of the church (we never went and when I asked my mom about it once she said if anyone asked to just say we’re Protestant). I could list them all, but I’ll just pick a few of the ones that are especially vibrant in my memory, I’ll also try to go in some rough chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not sure if any of what I’m about to talk about is ‘traumatic’, because how does one go about defining what exactly is and is not ‘traumatic’? (Serious question, because I’m so emotionally disconnected/inept and idk if that’s my upbringing or my autism or a mix of the two that I have no idea how to tell) Idk how to say if something is traumatic; though I’ll usually belittle and disregard the idea in others when they say something is traumatic. I’ll say they’re being dramatic, or just ‘no it’s not’; but that’s mostly because I’ve been raised to ‘be tough’, and to me, people carrying on about how something is/was ‘traumatic’, and making a public display of it; idk it’s like they’re admitting to being weak. Which, if they had any sense they would realize is a bad idea because it invites others to kick you while you’re down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre-school, someone was celebrating their birthday with a pinyata; I had never seen one of these before, and I was unaware of what to do or what the ‘rules’ were about it. I managed to get a turn, it didn’t break, another kid got it opened; and when all the candy fell on the floor, I guess I assumed everyone would be nice and neat and orderly and things would get handed out. Naturally it was a bare-knuckle-free-for-all between about 20-25 four year olds. What did I do? I stood there, frozen, confused, unable to process what was happening; by the time I realized I could be doing the same as them, almost all the candy had been grabbed. I tried to grab something but I wasn’t quick enough and I ended up with nothing. I know this story sounds like it should be nothing, and in the grander scheme of things it is quite insignificant; but this is one of the earliest memories I have of something bad happening because of my autism and I think it sets the tone for what my life is. I was always a very sensitive child growing up, and this deeply upset me. I ended up crying at my desk, no one, not even the teachers offered to share or felt bad for me. I learned if I missed out when everyone else got theirs, then too bad for me; that’s my fault, do better next time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother would try to tell me “you’re a big boy now, and big boys don’t cry”, so more often than not I’d end up having an incident with another kid and would end up crying in a corner telling myself the same thing: “you’re a big boy, big boys don’t cry”, desperately trying to calm myself down. I always hated crying, I hated being sensitive, I hated being weak, I hated that being weak only made everyone want to hurt me more. I had to get stronger, I had to be better, I must learn how not to cry. Each day when I’d have a meltdown and start crying I’d try different methods to keep myself from crying; once I was able to abate my tears by not breathing; it made me so happy to have some sense of control over my emotions. I needed to get stronger, I needed to stop crying, I needed to stop being so sensitive so that others wouldn’t feel so inclined to treat me the way they did. I had to be ‘normal’, I would study my tormentors, see how they interact amongst themselves and how they treated me; and I would try to unravel the mysteries of how ‘normal’ people act and think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preschool and elementary school, no one would want to play with me or allow me to play in their group (the soul exception was kick ball, but that didn’t even last a year before they didn’t want me playing with them anymore either). I got transferred around to several different schools throughout the early years, probably no less than 3 schools before 5th grade, but everywhere I went it was the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d usually spend recess alone reading in the shade, one school had a pine tree I loved to sit under and read, but when the teachers found out I was hanging out there they told me I couldn’t go there anymore because ‘they couldn’t see me’ over there, a valid excuse, but you know where I am and you should know I’m trying to avoid the other students and enjoy myself. If I try to read up nearer the school everyone will see me and start harassing me, asking what I’m reading, taking it from me, refusing to give it back, destroying it, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In first or second grade, we had a bathroom in the corner of our classroom. One day when I went to use it, I had to poop. Something about me: I’ve suffered from chronic constipation my whole life, so it took me a while. When I got out, the teacher dragged me to the front of the classroom and screamed at me (she tried to ask me the question a couple of times and I didn’t answer because I was embarrassed, so she’d raise her voice until she was eventually  screaming at me) “what were you doing in there!?” To which I could only answer honestly, through tears streaming down my face at the humiliation “I was pooping”, and the entire class burst out into laughter and I was allowed to go back to my seat where I tried to forget I existed for the rest of the day. This gave me problems for decades when it came to using public restrooms, something I’ve only recently gotten over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary school; when I was in gym class one day, our teachers took us outside to play baseball. I knew enough about baseball to know you need to hit the ball and run to your bases without getting out; but what I was clueless on was the line forming etiquette. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point my low standing on the social hierarchy had been well established already, so of course I get pushed to the back of the line after I was picked last. I’m fine with this, as long as everyone keeps their order I’ll slowly advance and get my turn to swing; the other team gets enough outs, we switch, same deal, switch back; but no one is maintaining the original line position, and again I get shoved to the back of the line. This repeats, over and over again until class is over. At this point I’m furious, I try to tell the teacher through tears how I’ve been keeping track and literally every other person got a turn to swing except for me. The teacher didn’t care, I’m dumbfounded; so I throw a fit saying I’m not leaving the field until I get my turn, the teacher laughs and says ‘ok have fun’ and leads the class back inside the building, leaving me alone on the field, crying. Not one person spoke up for me, no one wanted to help me feel better, no one cared; something you may have already picked up on, but it’s a bit of a theme in my life it seems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive had 2 babysitters smack me around. I can’t say why the one did it, but the one did it because I accidentally rode into his leg with my bike. Now from my perspective back then, I saw I was coming straight at him and I wanted to stop, but in a moment of panic, I completely forgot how to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I had a rare instance of a good day in which I didn’t get into any fights or trouble at school. I was riding the bus on my way back to my babysitters, and I honestly can’t remember what happened on the bus-if anything; but 3 kids followed me off the bus and waited until we were away from the main roads and started chucking rocks at me, several of them left bruises, but a few broke the skin. I was bleeding from the head by the time I got to my babysitters house. What did I do while they were pelting me with stones? Nothing, I just kept walking, I had such a ‘good’ day, and I didn’t want to ‘ruin’ it by getting in trouble at the last minute. To this day my mom still has the pictures she took of me with my face covered in my own blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times over the years after incidents like this, I brought up the idea of suing the people that did things to me, or the teachers and schools for allowing it to happen (i know because the rocks happened outside of school there’s nothing they could have done) but I was always shot down, being told something along the lines of ‘everyone’s going around suing each other these days, we’re not like that.’ I can still remember coming home from pre-school and elementary school pretty much every day, running, crying to my room and screaming about how “I wish I were dead”; luckily as a child I had no idea how to commit suicide, otherwise I’d have likely had an attempt or two under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same babysitter (from the stone story) my mother and I would end up finding dead one morning. My mom brought me over to drop me off and she wasn’t answering the door, so my mom managed to ‘break in’ and found her dead on her bed. By this point in my life (this would have probably been early to mid middle school) I was already so jaded from my life’s experiences and so numb I was more or less unbothered by her death. I remember my mom crying saying she wishes she could make me understand death, I understood she was gone and we’d never see her again, but I also figured we were never super close; she’d watch me for 30 minutes or less before the bus would grab me and I’d hang out there and watch TV in a separate room while waiting for mom to get off work. So she was never someone who was super important or special in my life. I was actually kind of jealous, her suffering was over (she was on morphine because of a metal plate she had in her head), she no longer had to deal with the suffering that comes with living; I couldn’t be sad about that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I also attended a vo-tech center; on the bus ride to vo-tech one day, this kid I wasn’t paying any attention to or interacting with thought it would be ‘funny’ to choke me out from behind. He eventually let go, but I grabbed his arm and put it back around my neck, begging him to finish what he started; much to my disappointment, he didn’t oblige. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had almost all the guys in my gym class once think it would be ‘funny’ to dog-pile on me, I was about to pass out when the teacher decided enough was enough and made everyone get off as I desperately gasped ‘help! I can’t breathe!’. I’m sure if I hadn’t spoken up they would have let it continue until I passed out, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept telling myself ‘I just need to make it through 12 years, then I’m out of here and I’ll never have to see these people again’. Graduation day came and went, my last responsibility and obligation free summer quickly came and passed before my first day of college. Finally, an actual, real fresh start. Somewhere where no one knows me, I figure my ‘reputation’ was permanently sullied at my old school, but all my years of learning how to interact through painful trial and error were finally going to pay off. No longer would I be a ‘r****d’, I’d be ‘normal’, just like everyone else and never again would people be so cruel or hateful towards me for being different. My life was about to get exponentially better and I couldn’t be more excited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled to make friends in college, and a few people still thought I was extremely weird or even outright hated me; but here I wasn’t bullied, assaulted, or harassed; I’m just not included in things, I’m isolated. I manage to make a few friends; each week two of the kids (brothers) who hate me would host a LAN party to play video games, I’m always interested, but I learned a long time ago from trying to include myself in things, if I’m not invited, it’s best to assume I’m not wanted; and naturally I was never invited. Any time I’d try to invite or include myself in a groups fun I’d get told to get lost, no one likes me, how I should kill myself, etc. Not until the last week or so of college, I get randomly invited to the last LAN party at lunch. Being told I’m welcome to come and ‘the more the merrier’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attend the party, I think all is going well, I’m friends with some of these kids, not so much with others, but I think I may have found a group, a cliche, somewhere I belong. We all get hungry and go out to Steak and Shake; while we’re eating, i can’t remember what I said, i thought we were all having a good time, my best friends gf (at the time, ex now) says “You know what anon, you have got to be, THE, CREEPIEST, MOTHERF****R, I’ve ever met in my life! We had been around each other a couple of times before then so I thought we were all good. But when she made that declaration, no one; not even my best friend, stood up to defend me…my soul was crushed, I took her outburst and their silence to speak to a general consensus and agreement. Despite my 12 years of suffering and training to learn how to interact like a normal person; after all that, I still get told how much of a creep I am. Have all my years of suffering been pointless? Is this just what existence is meant to be for me? For my kind? I don’t know what I did in my last life to earn so much negative karma, I dont understand what I’ve done to deserve such a fate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since college, I’ve had a few similar instances at different places I’ve worked. I’ve had more than a couple of instances at places I’ve worked where people felt they had to tell me what a creep I am. I’ve been told I ‘look like’ a school shooter, a pedo, a f*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;t, a r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*d, etc; just for trying to make friends with the people I find myself surrounded by. No matter what I do, it seems impossible for me to win; this just seems to be my lot in life: struggling desperately to make connections to others so as not to be alone, only to be nearly universally rejected and told how I’m still weird and that no one likes me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions surrounding my life, the way others have treated me, and my perception of my life, have all culminated in the person I am now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked so hard, all my life, to try and be ‘normal’, so that I can fit in to the world around me. I’ve taken every strong feeling I ever had and systematically shoved it down into a deep, dark corner of my mind. Because ultimately I’ve learned that the majority of humans don’t care and will actively work to make things worse if they know something bothers you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because; my entire life, my existence has seemed paradoxical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I was born into a world I was never meant for. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for modern medicine and doctors, the condition I was born in, would have proven fatal at any other point in human history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I tried to make friends growing up it was met with failure, rejection, and ridicule. It just seems like everyone, including god, has been against me from the beginning, like I was never meant to live for more than a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it just seems natural given the circumstances, that I am punished for living when I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to; like this is what you get when you go against the natural order of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if anyone else has faced similar circumstances, if anyone out there can relate, empathize with me, if anyone feels similarly; if anyone can prove me wrong, that humans aren’t evil by nature: willing to jump on anyone they feel they have an advantage over, anyone they view as someone less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need help. (And yes, i have been seeing a therapist for a little over a year now. That’s the only reason i can even talk about all this)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m the most pathetic person I’ve ever known in my life. Look at me: I’ll be 31 this July (2022), and I’ll have accomplished absolutely nothing in my life. I’m pretty much in the same situation that I’ve been in for the previous 10 years: Living out a dismal existence in a low-income apartment, with only a disability check, never had my own car (could never afford one and this is the land of the car, sigh…), living from monthly check to monthly check.

I’ve been diagnosed with things like: high-functioning autism, depression, and ADHD. I was in special ed in grade school - never had any friends. I dropped out of school in sixth grade, just to be trapped in that old decaying house which was several miles away from town. Both my parents were of ‘advanced age’ when they had me. My mother would sit there and accuse my sick dad and his family of all sorts of crazy things – like poisoning her smokes or ‘plotting or planning’. When I was younger, I had a big half-sister who basically raised me, but she left when she was a teenager and… I don’t want to talk about that. In fact, there’s a lot of things that I would much rather take to the grave than ever talk about with anyone, because it’s too painful, embarrassing, makes me look like an utter piece of shit.

I’ve been taking antidepressants and talking with a counselor for years. I’m ashamed of the sheer lack of progress. It’s a cycle: Oh, I’m doing something new, that’s cool. You’re going out for walks, you’re writing stuff, you’re composing music, or we just talk about current events. That’s if he doesn’t spend about a third of his appointment time on the phone. I’ve made a fool out of myself on the Internet in the past because all I know how to do is be a toxic piece of shit who shits on everyone and everything. I can’t connect with people, even online. I’m too boring, too toxic, too miserable, and I fucking hate it.

I’m utterly ashamed of who I am as a person. Who the ‘real me’ is. The ‘real me’ is a horribly bitter narcissist who doesn’t want to work for anything ever. Who doesn’t want to do anything for anyone. In fact, I’m not willing to do anything for myself. I’ve wasted literal years on YouTube, video games, reading Wikipedia and Reddit, trolling on forums. When it comes to any internet community, I’m forever doomed to be one of these three things: A lurker, boring, or banned. Then the era of social media, with its ‘real’ names and ‘influencers’, just kinda killed it. I hate it.

Several years ago I used to have several friends on IM, but again, I was ashamed of the way I acted. I talked too much about boring shit, I was toxic and miserable, everything I said just kinda spewed out of my fingers with little thought or care. I hate the fact that every time I write something, it just ends up being an incoherent mess like this. I can’t sort my thoughts neatly or anything like that: if it doesn’t come out the way it is, it probably will never come out at all.

I’m the most unproductive person I know. And I feel powerless to improve that because of my low energy and ever-fluctuating mood, plus my inability to concentrate. I used to take Adderall but apparently, if you’re not doing anything with your life, then fuck you. You’re gonna take Welbutrin, and you’re gonna love it. Sure, Adderall had its negative side effects: Severe constipation (fun to deal with), painfully dry ear canals, dry nose… At least I didn’t have to put up with allergies anymore.

A few years ago, my nurse practitioner retired and a new one came in - That’s when I lost my Adderall script for good. Then what little productivity I had just gradually crashed down into nothingness. It’s one of those things: Why didn’t you do anything about that? Why didn’t you talk to this and that person and try to do this and that… Ugh! Every goddamned thing is “why don’t you do this and do that”. Look, I wouldn’t be in this fucking mess if I didn’t have so many issues with communicating to people on the phone, IRL, or even on the Internet.

I got sick of reaching out for help on the Internet years ago, because that usually results in more misery later on. At least, that’s what I think. Being afraid of trying to reach out, trying to make new friends, or even just saying how I feel, because I always fail. I always say too much, too little, or the wrong thing. Or never want to make a commitment. Or just brush off whatever advice they give me. I feel so alienated from the rest of the world that I fear the day that I’ll lose the few Internet friends I have now.

I’m pretty much good at nothing. No skills. Unemployable. And it’s my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all on me. Stop blaming your parents for your failures, they’re both dead. What about their extended families who did nothing? Who knew that I was in a shit situation as a child. I wish I could start all over again. Wipe the slate clean. But then I’d probably find someway to half-ass it, to fail, to make myself look like a pathetic idiot. Not even a life worth living. Nothing to contribute to society, at all.

I can see why it’s so hard for people to seek help. I know I need help. But that takes a kind of commitment. Some faith in both them and yourself. You gotta work to change yourself, you can’t just sit here and go on and on about how you’re such a failure in life. Reach out, get out of your comfort zone, make some friends. It’s like I somehow don’t know. I do know. It just doesn’t make a difference, because my entire life is dictated by my feelings and my desires. The way I feel at the moment is the only thing that matters.

My sleep patterns are always shifting forwards. It seems like I go to bed later and later, and wake up later and later, and I don’t like taking sleeping pills. There are weeks when I sleep all day, and weeks where it’s in-between. Sleep half the day and half the night. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea last year, had to wait half a fucking year to even get the CPAP machine, then I fucked around and waited until it was too late to swap masks and have to wait until June to get another one. You see how utterly useless I am at solving my own issues in life? Because I’m too fucking afraid of placing a phone call, to argue with someone, etc.

Of course, I’m not employed, I’m not having a bad day at work, I’ve got it easy! Never mind the fact that my lazy existence is the most I can do. The prospect of even trying to attain employment at this point is probably scarier than just jumping off of that cliff. I could go to college, but I fear that I’ll lose motivation and just flunk classes again, and get stuck with student debt. My whole life is fear of failure, validated by nothing but past failure. And my future is nothing but failure. I know it’s only going to get downhill from here. What’s the point?

I’m a child in an adult’s body who refuses to accept adult responsibilities, because I’m too weak to ignore the mental anguish which comes with years of social isolation. I’m too weak to face my fears head on. Because if I do try, I’m probably going to get completely destroyed. Or just give up after only a little while because it’s too painful. I’m scared. It all just seems so impossible and overwhelming. And I need to do It alone with little resources.

I fear that I’ll be stuck homeless sometime in the near future, having to leave everything I’ve ever owned behind, no one to turn to. Nowhere to go, but down. All it takes is for me to fail a yearly inspection, to fail the once-every-two-years disability review, or for my health to fail, and it’s all over. All over. And it’s going to be pain and misery, separated from the few things in life I hold dear. I’ll go completely insane and unable to help myself in any meaningful way. I’ll be truly better off dead.

I’m very sorry if reading this has been frustrating or depressing, because believe me – it IS fucking frustrating and depressing. If you can even make any sense of what I’m trying to say. I don’t think I even know what I’m trying to say, other than I’m the most pathetic, hopeless person I know. And please don’t suggest weed, that shit won’t help me. Nothing will help me at this point. I don’t want to ever talk about my problems, it’s too painful. Embarrassing. I have to be vague or it’ll hurt far too much for me to bear. At least that’s what I feel.

I know that I’ve been a lot more fortunate than a lot of other people. People who suffered from similar things I have. Neglectful family, depression, autism and yet I’m the most pathetic one out there. I just sit here and waste time. Waste time. Never creating anything. Never getting into anything new or deeper into what I’m really interested in. It’s not like I don’t have interests and hobbies, but even I fail massively at those. I’ve tried to learn Spanish or Japanese, but I failed because I don’t try. I’ve tried to learn programming, drawing, writing, or even just being good at any game that I play. And the sheer repetition and lack of progress just makes me less and less interested over time. I just don’t fucking try, ever. I just sit here like a sack of shit and somehow magically expect to just ‘get good’ at it.

My interests are narrow to the point of unhealthy obsession. It could be a single show, a book, a video game, a song, a small community, if it gives me pleasure, I’ll cling onto it for dear life until I burn myself the fuck out. And when that happens, it’ll be far too long until I find another thing which satisfies me. It could be days, weeks, months before something somehow catches my eye. Or I revisit something, just to milk any new pleasure from it dry and be empty again. I hate that. I wish I could just float from one game to another, one show to another, etc. just so that I have something to talk with people about! But I don’t. I just don’t.

Please don’t say I’m just being modest or too hard on myself. It’s the truth. It just is. I’ve either lost all self-control, or just never learned it in the first place. I just cried. I rarely ever cry, probably because I don’t have the guts to do it, or I’m just too dead inside. But I do hurt. I do care. I want the mental anguish to stop. I want the running thoughts to stop. I want this fucking fear anxiety and depression to stop. I want to be able to be alive again. It’s been far too long.

I want to be able to stop running away from my problems one day. That would be nice. One day, things will get better. I’ll be able to stand up and face my fears, my problems, and conquer them. Become better. Go back to school. Get some connections and resources. Get some friends. And of course, get some sort of source of income. Wonderful. It’ll happen, I just need some time to recover, some time to relax, to think, to do.

But that won’t happen. It’s all lies. Pathetic lies I tell myself so that I can even get out of bed sometimes. The lies I need to live. That’s all it is. Without those lies, without being interested in something, without having some sort of pleasure, I’m absolutely nothing. I’m an empty husk of a man and my only hope for this pain to go away at this point is to pay the biggest price possible: My life. My worthless, pathetic, childish, empty life of nothing.

There’s no words that’ll help me. There’s no drugs that’ll make me feel better. There’s nothing I can watch or read that can make me feel better. There’s nothing inside of me which can bring me to change. I feel that I just sat here and allowed myself to be too far gone, and that’s perhaps the most terrible shame I have. Because I was too scared to do anything.

Please, don’t fear for me. I’ll try to get through this one way or another. I want to live and experience things. Maybe that’s also just a lie. It’s getting to the point where all I know is short bouts of joy and laughter, before long bouts of nothingness, sadness, grief, fear, and hatred. I’m stuck on this never-ending cycle and I have no way out. I don’t want to cry for help. I don’t want to do anything. I just want to be. But I fear that one day, just ‘be-ing’ will be too much to bear, and I have no idea what I’ll do other than to just lie there and suffer in isolation.

If you’ve somehow read this far, thank you. I’m almost done now. I suppose I’ll just get back to the daily grind of being too afraid and tired to do anything meaningful with my days. And being utterly ashamed of how much of a pathetic lazy piece of shit I am. The time just flies by. It feels like the pandemic only started yesterday. It feels like I’ve only moved in here last month. And that I’ve only turned 18 just a few years ago. I’ll be in the same place nine years from now and probably be suffering from diabetes or some other health ailment. Just another thing to drain my limited energy reserves even more every goddamn day until I inevitably fuck up and something terrible happens.

Thanks again for reading this.

Look at me: I’ll be 31 this July (2022), and I’ll have accomplished absolutely nothing in my life. I’m pretty much in the same situation that I’ve been in for the previous 10 years: Living out a dismal existence in a low-income apartment, with only a disability check, never had my own car (could never afford one and this is the land of the car, sigh…), living from monthly check to monthly check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been diagnosed with things like: high-functioning autism, depression, and ADHD. I was in special ed in grade school - never had any friends. I dropped out of school in sixth grade, just to be trapped in that old decaying house which was several miles away from town. Both my parents were of ‘advanced age’ when they had me. My mother would sit there and accuse my sick dad and his family of all sorts of crazy things – like poisoning her smokes or ‘plotting or planning’. When I was younger, I had a big half-sister who basically raised me, but she left when she was a teenager and… I don’t want to talk about that. In fact, there’s a lot of things that I would much rather take to the grave than ever talk about with anyone, because it’s too painful, embarrassing, makes me look like an utter piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking antidepressants and talking with a counselor for years. I’m ashamed of the sheer lack of progress. It’s a cycle: Oh, I’m doing something new, that’s cool. You’re going out for walks, you’re writing stuff, you’re composing music, or we just talk about current events. That’s if he doesn’t spend about a third of his appointment time on the phone. I’ve made a fool out of myself on the Internet in the past because all I know how to do is be a toxic piece of shit who shits on everyone and everything. I can’t connect with people, even online. I’m too boring, too toxic, too miserable, and I fucking hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m utterly ashamed of who I am as a person. Who the ‘real me’ is. The ‘real me’ is a horribly bitter narcissist who doesn’t want to work for anything ever. Who doesn’t want to do anything for anyone. In fact, I’m not willing to do anything for myself. I’ve wasted literal years on YouTube, video games, reading Wikipedia and Reddit, trolling on forums. When it comes to any internet community, I’m forever doomed to be one of these three things: A lurker, boring, or banned. Then the era of social media, with its ‘real’ names and ‘influencers’, just kinda killed it. I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I used to have several friends on IM, but again, I was ashamed of the way I acted. I talked too much about boring shit, I was toxic and miserable, everything I said just kinda spewed out of my fingers with little thought or care. I hate the fact that every time I write something, it just ends up being an incoherent mess like this. I can’t sort my thoughts neatly or anything like that: if it doesn’t come out the way it is, it probably will never come out at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the most unproductive person I know. And I feel powerless to improve that because of my low energy and ever-fluctuating mood, plus my inability to concentrate. I used to take Adderall but apparently, if you’re not doing anything with your life, then fuck you. You’re gonna take Welbutrin, and you’re gonna love it. Sure, Adderall had its negative side effects: Severe constipation (fun to deal with), painfully dry ear canals, dry nose… At least I didn’t have to put up with allergies anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my nurse practitioner retired and a new one came in - That’s when I lost my Adderall script for good. Then what little productivity I had just gradually crashed down into nothingness. It’s one of those things: Why didn’t you do anything about that? Why didn’t you talk to this and that person and try to do this and that… Ugh! Every goddamned thing is “why don’t you do this and do that”. Look, I wouldn’t be in this fucking mess if I didn’t have so many issues with communicating to people on the phone, IRL, or even on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got sick of reaching out for help on the Internet years ago, because that usually results in more misery later on. At least, that’s what I think. Being afraid of trying to reach out, trying to make new friends, or even just saying how I feel, because I always fail. I always say too much, too little, or the wrong thing. Or never want to make a commitment. Or just brush off whatever advice they give me. I feel so alienated from the rest of the world that I fear the day that I’ll lose the few Internet friends I have now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty much good at nothing. No skills. Unemployable. And it’s my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all on me. Stop blaming your parents for your failures, they’re both dead. What about their extended families who did nothing? Who knew that I was in a shit situation as a child. I wish I could start all over again. Wipe the slate clean. But then I’d probably find someway to half-ass it, to fail, to make myself look like a pathetic idiot. Not even a life worth living. Nothing to contribute to society, at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why it’s so hard for people to seek help. I know I need help. But that takes a kind of commitment. Some faith in both them and yourself. You gotta work to change yourself, you can’t just sit here and go on and on about how you’re such a failure in life. Reach out, get out of your comfort zone, make some friends. It’s like I somehow don’t know. I do know. It just doesn’t make a difference, because my entire life is dictated by my feelings and my desires. The way I feel at the moment is the only thing that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sleep patterns are always shifting forwards. It seems like I go to bed later and later, and wake up later and later, and I don’t like taking sleeping pills. There are weeks when I sleep all day, and weeks where it’s in-between. Sleep half the day and half the night. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea last year, had to wait half a fucking year to even get the CPAP machine, then I fucked around and waited until it was too late to swap masks and have to wait until June to get another one. You see how utterly useless I am at solving my own issues in life? Because I’m too fucking afraid of placing a phone call, to argue with someone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m not employed, I’m not having a bad day at work, I’ve got it easy! Never mind the fact that my lazy existence is the most I can do. The prospect of even trying to attain employment at this point is probably scarier than just jumping off of that cliff. I could go to college, but I fear that I’ll lose motivation and just flunk classes again, and get stuck with student debt. My whole life is fear of failure, validated by nothing but past failure. And my future is nothing but failure. I know it’s only going to get downhill from here. What’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a child in an adult’s body who refuses to accept adult responsibilities, because I’m too weak to ignore the mental anguish which comes with years of social isolation. I’m too weak to face my fears head on. Because if I do try, I’m probably going to get completely destroyed. Or just give up after only a little while because it’s too painful. I’m scared. It all just seems so impossible and overwhelming. And I need to do It alone with little resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that I’ll be stuck homeless sometime in the near future, having to leave everything I’ve ever owned behind, no one to turn to. Nowhere to go, but down. All it takes is for me to fail a yearly inspection, to fail the once-every-two-years disability review, or for my health to fail, and it’s all over. All over.

,depression,"I have been suffering from what I can only imagine is some kind of fairly severe depression for almost 2 years now. I’m sorry if this post is hard to read I’m new to redit and have been reading post in this sub and it just made me feel moved to share my story.

To start off my depression started almost 2 years ago. I was in a wonderful relationship with this beautiful girl I had met in highschool and I had moved away to college but I still came home every weekend to see her. Everything was going great and then over the course of a few weeks (or months, I don’t even remember how it really started) I just began to get more and more depressed. At first I didn’t think anything of it, I’m the middle child of 2 other boys, we grew up with a very abusive father until I was 12 when my mom took us and left and I just always through depression was something only weak people got and i never fully understood it. Although now I know that my real father struggled while mental illness and sever depression. Anyway back to my story, every in my life was going great, I had made new friends in college and my relationship was going great I just could feel myself becoming more and more closed off and lonely even though I was surrounded by amazing friends and family. I began to fight with my girlfriend because she could tell I was being distant we started to fight more and more the the distance only made it worse. When I finally did open up to her all she knew to do was tell her mother with made me miserable, I hated that fact that I thought someone saw me as weak and I started to dread seeing her and her family. A couple months into my depression and my girlfriend has become the only person who truly knows how I feel and is the only person I ever confide in. 

Then one day a close friend of my girlfriends commented suicide. This absolutely destroyed her, she became extremely depressed and started to have suicidal thought. I then pushed all my problems aside and did my best to help her through her issues. I took her to counseling and did everything I could to help her. But she slowly got better and was never the same. And now with us both being depressed our relationship became miserable, neither one of us were happy and we thought that if we split up maybe we would be able to find some joy in our lives again, so we broke up in made and these last 10 months have been the worst of my life. She was my best friend and the only person in the world I have ever loved. It’s gotten easier these past few months but I have lost all joy in my life. Everything I used to love i have no passion for anymore. I’m still in college but I don’t every compete any off my work, I never go to class. I hardly ever sleep, ill go 5 or 6 night sleeping maybe 2 hours a night then ill just sleep 18 hours straight. I find no meaning in life anymore, I just feel this giant empty hole in my chest that I can’t feel. My grandmother died last month, we were extremely close and I never even shed a tear, the rest of my family was balling and I was just sitting there with no emotion. I’m never happy, I’m not even sad, I just feel absolutely nothing. Almost every other night i put my pistol to my head just hoping it’ll go off because I’m not man enough to actually pull the trigger. I’ve tried to move on and tried to get better I just don’t know what to do, and I have no one to tell. I transferred colleges so I lost all the friends I had and I’m too embarrassed to tell me family. I’ve read every self help book I can find and nothing does it for me. I just keep praying that one day soon God will take me off this earth because I don’t know how to keep living like this.

,depression,"I'm just summarizing my current/past situation, because I'm really exhausted:
- Moved to a new city some days ago (shared flat with 5 people) for an internship, staying for finishing my degree
- Lived in a shared flat before (roommate was barely there -&gt; kinda got comfy with being alone, focusing on myself)
- I'm closer to some friends and my gf now (lives in the same city)

Besides all of these good things...I feel so smashed, my sleep got really bad (quite sensitive to noise and the flat is louder than the old one, at least this is my first impression), can't really eat anymore, lost already 4-6 pounds of weight

Some thoughts I have:
- Weather is getting better, other people expect now from me to show up at parties/get together etc -&gt; kinda frightens me, but also makes me happy to have the possibility
- How long should I try getting comfy in the new flat/city?

- Moved to a new city some days ago (shared flat with 5 people) for an internship, staying for finishing my degree
- Lived in a shared flat before (roommate was barely there -&amp;gt; kinda got comfy with being alone, focusing on myself)
- I&amp;#39;m closer to some friends and my gf now (lives in the same city)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides all of these good things...I feel so smashed, my sleep got really bad (quite sensitive to noise and the flat is louder than the old one, at least this is my first impression), can&amp;#39;t really eat anymore, lost already 4-6 pounds of weight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts I have:
- Weather is getting better, other people expect now from me to show up at parties/get together etc -&amp;gt; kinda frightens me, but also makes me happy to have the possibility
- How long should I try getting comfy in the new flat/city?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"My wife recently revealed to me that her mother has extreme depression and has had it for most of her life; never once been diagnosed and they could never afford to go to the doctor or get medication for it. On top of that they're immigrants and mental health was either non-existent or extreme taboo; her grandparents were also abusive and dealing with their own mental issues.  


Her mom stays up super late, wakes up at like 4 PM everyday and sits in bed doing nothing but watching videos on her phone.  


She never cooks, cleans, wants to do anything. She never has the energy either. Is not capable of even taking care of herself sometimes.  


She struggles with almost any and all tasks, simple tasks like dishes or taking a shower can take hours to complete. Rarely leaves the house, has no job.  


If she has an appointment or something time sensitive...9/10 she will be late or just wont show up.  


Growing up my wife said that they all made their own food cause their mom just never cooked. They never had people or friends over cause the house was never clean. Laundry was only completed when it became overwhelming. Cleaning was a whole day ordeal because her mom just kept putting it off until they couldn't help it anymore. Marriage has been in shambles for decades but somehow still together.   


Now they finally have health insurance and can probably be see a doctor.

,depression,"I'm 28 going 29 this year. Life has always been a Rollercoaster for me. Consistently an A student till HS. Then dropped out of college due to severe disinterest and had to take care of mother that had Stage 3 cancer. Not formally diagnosed but I'm sure that's when I developed some sort of depression. After all that, I went to work on and off in small bakeries without formal training of any kind (which is a pressure of its own). Cooking and baking has always been my catharsis though, which is why I never gave up pursuing this career, even now. Picked it up really well but have gaps of missing knowledge since I never went to culinary school. Was doing well for a few years there but then the pandemic hit, and at the same time my mother went into remission, so I had to leave the west coast back to the east to take care of her. I love my family, don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to take of them. But we are not financially stable in any sense, even before the pandemic. So I guess this is where it leads to, the present, my current rock bottom (always thought the low points of my life can't get any worse, but here I am experiencing it all over again). Mom is now stable, or as stable as can be, so I'm back in the west coast and currently have a job working in a hotel in pastry.

I'm pretty good at what I do, or at least the things I know how to do, in terms of pastry. But working at a hotel is a whole different scene and they expect a lot out of you.

Life has always been a Rollercoaster for me. Consistently an A student till HS. Then dropped out of college due to severe disinterest and had to take care of mother that had Stage 3 cancer. Not formally diagnosed but I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s when I developed some sort of depression. After all that, I went to work on and off in small bakeries without formal training of any kind (which is a pressure of its own). Cooking and baking has always been my catharsis though, which is why I never gave up pursuing this career, even now. Picked it up really well but have gaps of missing knowledge since I never went to culinary school. Was doing well for a few years there but then the pandemic hit, and at the same time my mother went into remission, so I had to leave the west coast back to the east to take care of her. I love my family, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I am more than happy to take of them. But we are not financially stable in any sense, even before the pandemic. So I guess this is where it leads to, the present, my current rock bottom (always thought the low points of my life can&amp;#39;t get any worse, but here I am experiencing it all over again). Mom is now stable, or as stable as can be, so I&amp;#39;m back in the west coast and currently have a job working in a hotel in pastry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty good at what I do, or at least the things I know how to do, in terms of pastry. But working at a hotel is a whole different scene and they expect a lot out of you.&lt;/p&gt;

He&amp;#39;s the only reason why I continue to fight. I continue to feed and make him drink with a syringe. He hates it when others do it but he trust me his life. I wish I could tell him I&amp;#39;m sorry that couldn&amp;#39;t do anything. I love you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll have my final interview in an hour. I know it&amp;#39;s selfish for me to say I wish I get through it when he&amp;#39;s the one dying. I don&amp;#39;t know where else to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I think i hit a dead end in my life.

i've been first diagnosed with depression and antisocial disorder back in 2013 which resulted from kids bullying me at school because i had no parents and came from a lower class family. I tried to kill myself 3 times but always somehow survived, sometimes i make jokes about it saying that might be immortal lol 

I'm currently in my last year of high school but i probably won't be able to graduate because my grades are beyond bad and i don't have time to fix them.
It was mostly because i spent half of the year sick after getting diagnosed with some potentially cancerous tumors in my lungs( my mother died from cancer so its no wonder) and the other half working so i can live somewhat decently. 

I mean it's not like i want to die, but i kinda dont wanna live either.
I still have big plans for the future, i would like to become a pilot one day because of my lifelong love for planes and all things flying, but its all hella expensive and i don't think that i will ever achieve it.

I feel like the only thing that brings me at least a bit of joy is cars, fast driving and flying. But again: money.

I've seen a few different therapists and gone through more kinds of antidepressants than i can remember but nothing has really helped so far.

I mean im 21 so i stil technically have my whole life in front of me bit i just feel so tired of living like this.
 I don't have any motivation to do things besides money and thrills. 
I just feel like i have no purpose in this world. 
I tried volunteering but i just didn't feel comfortable working for free without anything in return.
 Ik its selfish but that's just how i am. I didn't get any free help from anyone in my life ever, i always had to pay for everything.

It was mostly because i spent half of the year sick after getting diagnosed with some potentially cancerous tumors in my lungs( my mother died from cancer so its no wonder) and the other half working so i can live somewhat decently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean it&amp;#39;s not like i want to die, but i kinda dont wanna live either.
I still have big plans for the future, i would like to become a pilot one day because of my lifelong love for planes and all things flying, but its all hella expensive and i don&amp;#39;t think that i will ever achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the only thing that brings me at least a bit of joy is cars, fast driving and flying. But again: money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a few different therapists and gone through more kinds of antidepressants than i can remember but nothing has really helped so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean im 21 so i stil technically have my whole life in front of me bit i just feel so tired of living like this.
 I don&amp;#39;t have any motivation to do things besides money and thrills. 
I just feel like i have no purpose in this world. 
I tried volunteering but i just didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable working for free without anything in return.
 Ik its selfish but that&amp;#39;s just how i am. I didn&amp;#39;t get any free help from anyone in my life ever, i always had to pay for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall im just sad and angry all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However for anyone else that is going through what I am, please don&amp;#39;t stop trying to get better, I know you can do it. I may not be strong enough but im sure you will win this fight. Do it for everyone who has already given up on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I regret backing out of committing suicide pretty often. I’ve done it three times now, overdosed once. 

From the outside I know for a fact I look like a whiny teen. I’ve been told so many, many times.
I’m just tired of relapses. I’m tired of constantly putting everything I have into being better only to barely get anywhere, and then being exhausted. I’m tired of being yelled at for things I can’t control, and being told the same pathetic motivational quotes like they ever mean anything. 
I’m tired of people “praying” for me, saying I need to ask god for help. God wasn’t there for me when I was being sexually assaulted. God wasn’t there for me when my mom got blackout drunk and beat my sister in front of me. God wasn’t there when I was left alone for weeks because my dad would “rather be anywhere else”. I don’t care what people say, god isn’t real. There is no divine protection, and there is no savior. There’s life and death. What happens in between is your problem.

I’m tired of being labeled a mental case. 
I’m tired of seeing hallucinations, having flashbacks, and I’m tired of feeling manic. I’m tired of relying on prescription drugs to be good enough for society.

I wish I had done in then, because I have things to live for now. I have responsibilities and things that mean something to me. 
It’s like a dog having a bone dangled just far enough to where they can’t get it. 
I’ve come to terms that I’ll never be what my parents wanted me to be, and that my sister took on that role for me at a young age. A nurse at 27, dating to marry with a nice house in a nice neighborhood.
I’m struggling to even have the will to get up and enroll myself in community college. It’s pathetic. I work, but I work at a sports bar and because of my “disabilities” my hours keep getting cut. Turns out nobody wants to hire someone who can’t be around many people or loud noises, that goes into a manic episode if triggered. 

The more I think about what I am, the more depressed I get. Without the medication, I’d most likely be labeled “insane” and put in a glorified prison again. I take a lot of drugs and still see and hear the shit that I do, and I don’t remember half of my life when I was off of them. 
I keep getting told that it’s my fault by my mom, and she is basically begging me to “do something” but nothing I ever do is good enough, so why keep trying. 

I don’t know. It’s not logical to commit suicide at this point, but I can’t deny that I secretly hope a semi turns my car into a crushed can on my way to work. 

PTSD, severe depression, crippling anxiety, and psychotic disorder are not a good mix. Especially when you’re lucid.

,depression,"last year, when i was 14, I wrote a suicide note before attempting to suicide by overdose.

I tried to commit suicide because i was a closeted gay atheist in a really conservative muslim country and family. I tried to pray the gay away, I endured listening to a lot of homophobia and unfair religious teachings and i couldn't take it anymore. 

I wrote it in Arabic :

شعرت بأن الحياة لم تعد تطاق. بأنني اعيش في كذبة, شعرت كأنني قنبلة على وشك الانفجار في اي لحظة, شعرت بالوحدة على الرغم من اني لست وحدي, شعرت بان هناك خطأ في فكرة وجودي حتى, شعرت ان سعادتي تمثل خطيئة لا تغتفر و ان حقيقتي سر يجب ان يستتر. 

هذه الحياة كانت قاسية و غير عادلة, المكان الوحيد الذي ساجد فيه السلام هو قبري.

This life is cruel and unfair, the only place where i can find peace is my grave.

For once in my life I was truly happy, so happy some days it terrified me. I come from an abusive home with a father who abused alcohol and used to beat myself, my siblings and my mom until his death when I was 9 then my mom as an immigrant had to take over the family restaurant and try to keep us fed. We grew up very poor, often times I would get made fun of for wearing off branded clothes or hand me downs. What does any of this have to do with my story? Well this shaped my dependence on alcohol from the age of 16 till the age of 18 which was when I met her, her name was Tyler at this time I didn’t see myself having an addiction but then one day I was introduced to weed by her and her father  for the first time and really enjoyed myself. From then I started smoking more and more often. Eventually Tyler and I moved in together and quite honestly I was the happiest I had been in years, I would wake up in the morning and be excited about the future then I’d look at her and see my whole world and that terrified me. My happiness scared me cause I knew it could go away at any moment. After a year I started drinking heavily again and my little fling with weed turned into a full on obsession to the point where I’d be out smoking for hours while my girl was upstairs waiting for me to cuddle her and fall asleep. One day she was fed up and found out I spent all my money on weed and alcohol and decided I needed to move back home and we needed to break up, mind you she had tried to help me before but I just wasn’t receptive. Now it’s hard to even fall asleep cause I still see her in my dreams, I miss her.

,depression,"Recently, ive noticed that my hair started thinning (24M) and its been making me sad since. Especially that it happened to me at such a young age. For context, my older brother is already balding, and my dad is pretty much bald, so i guess i sort of already had a clue of what type of hand fate has dealt me. But it still sucks, and i am still in the process of TRYING to make my peace with it.

Ive never really considered myself to be emotional, in fact i like to think that i am a very mentally strong person. (As in i dont get realy bothered by things that much.). But just a few days ago, i broke down crying over my hair loss, this was probably the first time ive ever seen myself crying over something as mundane as hair, the last time i cried like that was during my mom's funeral.

With that having been said, i dont even style my hair that much, for me its just a thing thats there. So its safe to say that my attachment to my hair is pretty minimal (Or maybe thats just what i told myself over the years growing up with bald/balding people because i had to make myself feel safe? idk.)

As a young person (24) i started thinking about scenarios where i would never find a partner, or how people will laugh or look at me funny. Truth be told, i dont really consider myself unattractive, so i dont think my self-esteem or self-image is that bad. Although i have always been insecure about my height im 5'2, and even here in the Philippines, thats below average (average height here is 5'5). But the funny thing is, i didnt really have any desire to be in a relationship or find a partner, i never even thought about it once. Yet here i am now.

So the past few days ive been trying to internalize and process all these emotions. And i still dont understand why im reacting this way. Have i always been a vain person who likes his hair and just lied to myself to make myself feel better about the prospect of going bald? Or that i would actually very much like to be in a relationship?

Or is it because my balding has reaffirmed reality for me and made me realize that im not growing any younger? That i should make the most of my time while i still have hair and do the things that most people my age are doing? (E.g; Dating).

Or is it something else that i have overlooked?

What do you guys think? I didnt know balding could impact a person this bad. But its all ive been thinking about lately.

I am a woman but have always been goofy and girly all my life I never wanted to grow up or be sexual ever it made me so sad to. There were times I would bring cds on field trips with me as a kid and it was criticized because it was by girly artists and disney people while everyone else listened to rap music. Even now I prefer soft indie artists while everyone around me is listening to g eazy and rap shit. I like some rap, but I am picky about it. I would have my emotions always ignored and people just hyperfixate on what i wore and how i fuken looked. I don't like dating or sex because I attract very cold people and people are rough sexually and I just like sweet and sensual and soft things. I wish to be able to be more expressive and stay goofy but life is very serious and the outside world even on the day to day is cracked out and harsh. I see the craziest shit every day I step out; people getting caught on the escalators, a suicidal man wielding a knife at the train station, people fighting, crackheads and homeless everywhere even when I travel. Nothing is ever nice or pretty enough for me to post on instagram. Any time I opened up about emotions even now to people it's too heavy or I get wild eyed looks. Or people ignore me and just say 'i need d\*k' or to just get over it. People in the past would call me cold or selfish but when I tried to act friends or flirt I get called out for being sensitive or too nice.

So as you guys saw it was my 17th birthday today, and today was probably one of the shittier days I have.

,depression,"I think this is mental breakdown but over the past few months things have been slowly building up for me and I seem to have finally snapped last week.

My daily routine is basically wake up, shit, shower, brush, and sit on the PC until I go back to bed. I eat whenever I feel like it.

,depression,"I know not many people will see this or probably care, but I have no one, or at least no one, who'll genuinely listen. A year or two ago, I wasn't the best person, selfish and careless. I was an alcoholic and a drug addict to deal with everything, which I know now was a horrible coping mechanism, but it was all my 16-year-old brain knew how to do as addictions ran in my family. I was hypersexual with no fundamental understanding of consent because all I knew was assault. I would get drunk and say horrible things, and my actions reflected that. I know trauma isn't an excuse for everything I did to people I used to call my friends, but I swear I never meant to hurt anyone. I was horrible, and when I realized how much hurt I had caused, I never let myself live it down. I couldn't look at myself the same; I would cry for hours because I was a monster that brought trauma to others' lives. I honestly didn't know how to be healthy, and I didn't know how to make real friends without making it sexual because that's all I thought people wanted from me. I know these are a bunch of bullshit excuses, but I don't know what to do. I never wanted to be this person; I left the school that was once my haven because of the rumors. I can't tell who I am anymore. Am I the monster they think I am? I barely remember anything, and I was always drinking, so it's all a blur.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a girl, I'm 17, and this is where it started. I'm not going to give my life story, just the bits that matter. I was accused of assault almost a year ago now with many other claims that had to do with my toxicity. The original person who accused me and I had dealt with it privately, and she had recognized that I was extremely drunk when it happened and the lack of communication on both ends. Honestly, I have taken accountability for the fact that I shouldn't have drank underage and made her uncomfortable. I remember bits and pieces of that night, some of it I can't even put together in my head. But I realized that my behavior was unacceptable, and it wasn't okay. Not okay in the slightest. But it got out to my whole school, rumors began, and people I had past romantic and sexual relationships with accused me of either assaulting them or being toxic. I left the school and sought a lot of therapy, but the rumors have entered my life in a more public setting. I don't blame anyone. I was honestly a piece of shit, but I know everything was consensual. But now I'm not even sure of anything, I think I'm a monster. I don't know what's real and what isn't. I was manipulative and a downright horrible person but I've done everything I can to change and apologize but I can't seem to do it right. I want to take accountability and be better but also want my name out there on the internet associated with these things. My parents don't deserve this. I want to be able to be normal again but then I realize my life has never been normal. I've always lived through trauma, my life is basically one big thing of trauma whether I realize it or not. I'm so sorry, I really hate myself for hurting the people I did. I don't want pity and I know nothing I can do can fix my reputation. I don't even think I deserve it, I really think I should just kill myself. I think that'd give the people I hurt peace of mind. I don't think I deserve to live this life. I'm really sorry, I know you'll judge me too, but I promise I'm really trying to be better and to help people. I'm not sure which perception is real, theirs or mine.

I was an alcoholic and a drug addict to deal with everything, which I know now was a horrible coping mechanism, but it was all my 16-year-old brain knew how to do as addictions ran in my family. I was hypersexual with no fundamental understanding of consent because all I knew was assault. I would get drunk and say horrible things, and my actions reflected that. I know trauma isn&amp;#39;t an excuse for everything I did to people I used to call my friends, but I swear I never meant to hurt anyone. I was horrible, and when I realized how much hurt I had caused, I never let myself live it down. I couldn&amp;#39;t look at myself the same; I would cry for hours because I was a monster that brought trauma to others&amp;#39; lives. I honestly didn&amp;#39;t know how to be healthy, and I didn&amp;#39;t know how to make real friends without making it sexual because that&amp;#39;s all I thought people wanted from me. I know these are a bunch of bullshit excuses, but I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I never wanted to be this person; I left the school that was once my haven because of the rumors. I can&amp;#39;t tell who I am anymore. Am I the monster they think I am? I barely remember anything, and I was always drinking, so it&amp;#39;s all a blur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a girl, I&amp;#39;m 17, and this is where it started. I&amp;#39;m not going to give my life story, just the bits that matter. I was accused of assault almost a year ago now with many other claims that had to do with my toxicity. The original person who accused me and I had dealt with it privately, and she had recognized that I was extremely drunk when it happened and the lack of communication on both ends. Honestly, I have taken accountability for the fact that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have drank underage and made her uncomfortable. I remember bits and pieces of that night, some of it I can&amp;#39;t even put together in my head. But I realized that my behavior was unacceptable, and it wasn&amp;#39;t okay. Not okay in the slightest. But it got out to my whole school, rumors began, and people I had past romantic and sexual relationships with accused me of either assaulting them or being toxic. I left the school and sought a lot of therapy, but the rumors have entered my life in a more public setting. I don&amp;#39;t blame anyone. I was honestly a piece of shit, but I know everything was consensual. But now I&amp;#39;m not even sure of anything, I think I&amp;#39;m a monster. I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s real and what isn&amp;#39;t. I was manipulative and a downright horrible person but I&amp;#39;ve done everything I can to change and apologize but I can&amp;#39;t seem to do it right. I want to take accountability and be better but also want my name out there on the internet associated with these things. My parents don&amp;#39;t deserve this. I want to be able to be normal again but then I realize my life has never been normal. I&amp;#39;ve always lived through trauma, my life is basically one big thing of trauma whether I realize it or not. I&amp;#39;m so sorry, I really hate myself for hurting the people I did. I don&amp;#39;t want pity and I know nothing I can do can fix my reputation. I don&amp;#39;t even think I deserve it, I really think I should just kill myself. I think that&amp;#39;d give the people I hurt peace of mind. I don&amp;#39;t think I deserve to live this life. I&amp;#39;m really sorry, I know you&amp;#39;ll judge me too, but I promise I&amp;#39;m really trying to be better and to help people. I&amp;#39;m not sure which perception is real, theirs or mine. I&amp;#39;m broken down, and I wanna be a kid again with my favorite stuffed animal. Maybe, just take a nap and then I&amp;#39;ll wake up and be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

I do not feel alive, I do not feel like I matter, I do feel like I am in the way, and I do feel like my dreams are my only escape.

Lately I have had more anxiety or stress dreams tho...

Last one was about the world ending and everyone rich enough could get a ticket to go on lots of huge spaceships...
Ticket price was low enough for my aunt and uncle to afford it.
Left without a bother at all for me being alone.
It felt so strange seeing them board that ship and how little they cared...

The price was like... 700-1000 dollar per person...
Then added in was pets and I have 3 cats... cats cost 400 per cat...
I could not afford it...
So I was left alone.
Just watching ship after ship leaving.

Some malfunctioned and crashed...
It was weird watching....

Idk...
Im just tired of feeling alone or abandoned even in my dreams, and how people dont get how much my cats matter to me... they are here for me every day...

It’s a very weird feeling. I constantly think about my own death and how everyone around me that I love will also die.

,depression,"
(Nearly an essay) 

This journey start 10 years ago. I was 16. I’d already been diagnosed with Premenstral Dysphoric Disorder at 13 for uncontrollable fits of rage and crying til I was shaking every day a day before my period started. At 15, they tried putting me on the pill. It didn’t help. But I was happy with my boyfriend. I was a straight A student. Beautiful. A ballerina who sang like an Angel. My boyfriend made me happy. He was my dopamine. I was happy and content for a year. We were finally at third base. He felt my boobs under my shirt, I put my hand down his pants and stroked him, he did the same to me. We never were unclothed. But we dry humped like teenagers do. I orgasm for the first time. The second time the third. We go to Disney World. I share a bed with my mom he sleeps on the other. When my mom goes to the bathroom in the morning we steal kisses. I cry tears of joy watching the fireworks with him in front of Cinderella’s castle. I love him deeply. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. And we were close to having sex soon. 

Then one day the next week in July, he called me and tells me “I just don’t love you anymore.” I was devastated. Utterly abysmal in every way. I beg him to explain. He has no explanation. I thought we were perfect. 

After crying myself to sleep every night, sleeping with my mom again because I couldn’t control my constant will to die, my mom started bringing me to therapy. The therapist told me to my face that I was the most depressed individual he had ever seen. A few weeks pass. Endless trials and failures of different antidepressants. I have a major panic attack. I’m screaming out to God on deaf ears “Please take it away. Please make it stop. I don’t want to wake up anymore!” This was the first time I tried, but stopped because it hurt.  I agreed to be hospitalized. 

“I don’t  want to die but I didn’t want to live like this.” 

They admitted me to the pediatric mental ward. It was HORRIBLE. The first thing they did was strip search me and check every inch of my body for scars or any marks. They pointed out a little white mark on my toes that scarred because of repeated blisters from dancing on pointe and being a ballerina. 

The girls there were violent. They had tried to murder their grandmothers. They had hallucinations of people speaking to them through the tv telling them to stab people. There were daily fights. I felt like I was in prison. Every night I screamed crying in my room. They told me I wasn’t allowed to do that. They told me I couldn’t cry. The doctor told me I was acting like I thought I was better than everyone else. I tell him I’m not like the other girls here. I don’t want to kill any one I just don’t want to live like I am living and want help. He is dismissive. I am released. Nothing is better. If anything it made it worse. Now I had trauma from my time there. 

3 months go by. I am in therapy and a psychiatrist office every week. I still cry every night. I still sleep with my mom because she’s afraid to let me out of her sight during the night. She holds me as I rock back and forth until I finally pass out. 

My ex boyfriend ignores me in the hallways. I mourn for him like the grief of a death, and I see his ghost every day. I wear high heels and dress to the nines everyday. All the boys notice me, but him.  I appear bubbly, beautiful, and like I’m a perfect girl, yet I am in agony on the inside. I stare at the walls during AP language just to try to fight the never ending dread. I go to the bathroom to cry. I have a student say to me “Why are you so happy all the time?!” in a mean tone and that “Just being around me makes him feel poor.” I run to the bathroom and break down. I call my mom. After 30 minutes I return to class. I tell the boy that my dad is a used car salesman who sometimes doesn’t even bring home a paycheck. I’m not rich and I’m not as happy as I may seem. Life goes on. I continue the charade. 

I get the attention of the foreign exchange student from Spain. I like him back, he’d be a good distraction especially if I could fall for him. He rides his bike over to my house we cuddle and watch movies and end the night in sweet kisses, we go ice skating. He asks me to homecoming by holding up a giant sign in my favorite class dressed up in a suit. I’m happy for a few days. Things are looking up. A little. 

Then I see that my ex has been asked to escort one of the girls on the homecoming court. That night, I break. 


I am screaming, crying shaking, banging my head against the wall hoping I’ll give myself a concussion and not wake up the next day. I run into my dads closet and press my back hard against the door to keep my mom out. I attempt again but it hurts. It hurts too much. My mom is desperately trying to push her way into the closet. My dad comes and eventually gets his hands on me. Slapping  me across the face and grabbing me by the neck and throwing me on the bed because he didn’t know how to stop me and it enraged him. 

He didn’t understand. 

I fought back. Once my mom was able to get him to let me go, I ran in the bathroom and locked the door. My mom calls and the police on my dad. My dad convinces the chauvinist southern cop that I was attacking him. I scream that I was defending myself! He says that he doesn’t see any marks on me and that he could just as easily take me to jail. The cop leaves. 

The next time I go into an episode my dad is violent again. I make sure this time I have red marks on my arms. I rub them where he’d grabbed me to make sure they are still red by the time the cops and ambulance get there. 


They take me to the ER with my mom. They let my dad off again. The next day I’m escorted by ambulance to a facility 3 hours away called PineGrove. Tiger Woods had gone there for his addiction. It’s really nice and they only take non violent kids. There I found help. They put me on Lexapro. Things started to get better. My parents visit and for the first time in my life I see my father cry. He tells me he’s sorry and how much he loves me and that he just wants me to be happy. I hug my parents. When the social worker comes I tell them that I made it up and that my dad didn’t hit me. 

I go home. The Lexapro puts me on a baseline. I’m not happy. But I’m not screaming in agony every night. My ballet keeps me distracted. I go to homecoming with my beautiful Spaniard boyfriend. I had told him and the other kids at school I had been in the hospital for an ovarian cyst. Eventually we break up. I never really cared that much. He tells people he only dated me to fool around and because I had big boobs. In reality all we ever did was kiss on the front porch. 

I continue on. My grades are immaculate. I start dating my boyfriend I had in middle school again. After he had a motorcycle wreck. I love him and he really loves me. He had PTSD from the wreck and is in a cast from the waist up. He self medicated. Our relationship is incredibly volatile. He wasn’t the Shakespeare quoting boy I’d dated at 13, now he was a leather wearing motorcycle riding bad boys. I was still ballet and straight A’s. We date for a year breaking up and getting back together every two weeks. I know he’s on drugs. He lies I believe him. Happiness, mental abuse, manhandling me, slapping me. Steroid rage. High on who knows what. He scares me sometimes but I love him and always get back together with him. He does really love me, we were each other’s first kiss before and first loves. 

I make a high score on the ACT and graduate early. I go to audition for musical theater schools. I’m accepted into NYU with a full tuition scholarship. I’m ecstatic. 

After a year together we start having sex. He wasn’t a virgin. He’d cheated on me multiple times. I was. I can’t orgasm. I’m embarrassed. I talk to my new psychiatrist reluctantly. Sex was taboo. I went to church twice a week. I was made to feel like it was reserved for you husband. I am very embaraased to talk about it. She tells me it’s a side effect of the Lexapro. We keep dating it’s June or so of the summer before I leave for college. 

He cheats on me again. He gives me an  incurable STD. This time it’s over. I break up with him. I’m devastated. I feel so dirty. He was supposed to be my forever. We have lunch one last time before I go to college. He gives me a beautiful Pandora bracelet. And tells me he will always love me. I know he will and so will I. 

I go to NYU. I don’t date for two years. I don’t want to tell anyone about my STD. My gynecologist says it’s alright that it’s now undetectable and that this type doesn’t transfer easily anyway from genital to genital because HSV1 really only thrives on the mouth. I haven’t had another outbreak. I eventually start to date again. 

2017 I meet a Brazilian billionaire. I fall for him. He could have easily fallen for me… but he held me at arms length. He shows love with his actions but he pushes it away. He doesn’t want a girlfriend. He loses his visa and I tell him… “You know you don’t HAVE to go.” He tells me “I am not ready.” I am heartbroken. 

I start trying to get off the Lexapro. I want to be able to orgasm. I do fine on Wellbutrin and Trintellix but the orgasms don’t return. I graduate. I’ve gained 30 pounds since high school “too fat” by Broadway standards at 150. So I work backstage. I’m exhausted. 6 days a week. I don’t audition. I have lost my confidence. I no longer think I’m beautiful like I was in high school. 

2019. I go home for the summer between jobs. I finally have a good relationship with my dad. I go back to work. My dad dies suddenly from a heart attack. He was only 66. I went home to stay with my mom for a month before returning for a new show working backstage. My boss is horrible.  

In October, I meet a man. He is also from South America, he is a brain surgeon on a brief fellowship in NYC for 3 months. I immediately adore him. But after 4 or 5 dates. I push him away. I didn’t want to be heartbroken like I was with the last guy I’d dated and I knew I would fall in love with him if I kept seeing him and then he would leave. He tells me around Christmas that he can’t stop thinking about me. He wants to come to Mississippi to see me before he goes back. I don’t let him l, but we text, talk, and FaceTime as much as he can being a full time neurosurgeon working at 5 hospital. I think he’s superman. He’s so charming and kind and sweet. I didn’t ever think I’d meet anyone more suited for me than the Brazilian, but I hope this might be it. We make plans for him to come to NY in April. I’d go to South America in June. 

March 2020…. The world shuts down. Broadway shuts down. Covid forces me to flee the city. I go back home to my mom down South. My family make rude remarks at Mother’s Day about people getting so much money on unemployment. It hurts me. We don’t leave the house except to go through drive throughs. I can’t see my neurosurgeon. I miss him. The next year is really tough. I’m grieving my dad. I can’t see the man I love. But March 2021, I find a GREAT apartment for $1500 in the best part of the city. A “pandemic deal” they call them. Everyone says that they can only raise raise your rent 5% each year anyway so I’d be fine. I’d made more on unemployment the last year than I had in 3 years of working. My mom comes up to help me move in. I climb on a stool to put a basket on top of the kitchen cabinets…. I fall and break my foot and sprain the other ankle. 

I go back to Mississippi. I can’t walk. I can barely go to the bathroom on my knee scooter because I have an injury on both feet. I have to have surgery. My doctor is rude and had no bedside manner. I feel like a number. Ive gained 30 more pounds. I’m 175. I see stretch marks forming on my body. I’m embarrassed. I hate myself. I don’t know the happy beautiful girl I was at 15. She is a stranger. In my cast I roll into my dads closet again. I can’t control it. I’m in agony is so so many ways. I’ve lost so much. I attempt again. It hurts. I stop. I make at least 3 more half hearted attempts that summer only leaving wells and bruises on my head. Unable to walk. Miserable and fat. 

I finally can walk. I get to see the man I love for the first time in person in 2 years. I tell him that I’ve gained weight over the pandemic at this point about 30 pounds. He says he doesn’t care and that I’m still beautiful. We go to Disney World. But he is different than the first time we were together. He used hadn’t been able to keep his hands off me in NY. We’d had sex 3 times a night without stopping. Now he wouldn’t even make out with me in bed. I feel unwanted. Is it my body? I ask crying. He says it’s just weird that we don’t really KNOW each other in person and he doesn’t know how to react. I wonder if he had erectile dysfunction. I thought this was going to be a honeymoon like trip. That he’d finally tell me he loved me, but no. We had fun, but we had quick sex one time that week. Despite my efforts and beautiful lingerie. I suspect he may be an autistic savant. Masking so well that no one except those that are closest to him can tell. 

I go back to work backstage when Broadway opens. They worked me 90 hours one week. The actors treat me like I am less than them. They act like I’m their maid and unimportant. I forget how much more talented I am than them. I sing like a nightingale and am a classically trained ballerina. They make me fell worthless. I sprain my ankle backstage. I’m already suicidal. I quit. 

Two days later. My ex boyfriend. My first love, the bad boy, overdosed on Spiked meth and died. I was devastated. I was already suicidal 

I can’t walk again. I have lost so much. I don’t want to work in theater anymore the man I love isn’t affectionate. I’m now 185 pounds. My stretch marks are purple and red all over my belly. I don’t have a job. I don’t know what to do about the man I love. He still plans to come in December. But I’m prepared for another disappointment. I can’t find the will to live. I start to prepare another attempt. I call my mom I tell her  my plan and that i can’t keep doing this and this will be painless. She calls the police. 30 police show up and involuntarily commit me to a psychiatric ward in New York City. She flies up. I hate her for taking away my choice. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I fake it to get out of the hospital. Tell them I didn’t have intent. I had even asked if the item was returnable when I bought it. 

I am out in 3 days. I tell my man what happened being open for the first time about my mental illness . He is distraught but as a doctor he understands I can’t control it. I get ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression. They help me to not be suicidal almost immediately. He comes up and my mom flies out the same day. They get to meet. My mom loves him. 

As soon as we were alone he rips off my clothes, I think this is going to be much better than the last vacation, but he is quick and I am dry. No foreplay but I just wanted to feel close to him and wanted him. I want him inside me forever. I want him forever. We have an amazing time together the next couple of days. I try to initiate again in the bubble bath but suddenly the water turning back on because I was cold completely takes him out of it. We go to sleep. The next night I dress up in head to toe red lingerie. A corset and long flowing robe. I look like something out of a magazine. I have my hair done in 1940s waves and professional level makeup. I light candles. I keep trying to kiss him. He doesn’t seem interested I demand to know what is wrong. I tell him I’m in love with him. He looks at me confused like he couldn’t possibly understand why I “thought I loved him.” “We haven’t spent enough time together for you to love me.” I tell him i do. I tell him I want to spend my life with him. I want his beautiful smart babies. I want him body and soul. And he won’t even have sex with me. I ask why?!? “Do you have erectile dysfunction? Are you not attracted to me?!” He says he doesn’t have a problem and that he just thinks the word love means that he’s ready to get married and we haven’t spent a month together in person, though we’d been in a relationship for 2 years. I tell him I want to be exclusive. He agrees. I tell him that I’d tried to date after he rejected me in Disney world but no one would ever compare to him. He understands and agrees that he doesn’t want to see other people. I am crying. I snap at him to blow out the candles. I go to cry in the bath tub. I know he hears me. I calm down eventually. I come out and he is rolled over. The candles are blown out. I wrap my arms around him and tell him that I want to work things out. And that because I love him I want to be there for him until he can get his license here. He rolls over and holds me through the night. We are happy. He makes me happy. I talk to my psychiatrist. We both confirm that there’s a high probability that he is autistic. I accept it. It helps me understand him better. 

I go home for Christmas. Omicron surges. I’m afraid to go back to the city. 
In January, I get word form my landlord that it’s time to renew my lease. They’re raising my rent $800. I don’t have a job. It’s perfectly legal. I am having my home ripped away from me. I start searching for apartments online I can’t job search in NY if I don’t have a place to live by he end of March. I find the PERFECT apartment. It’s a rare rare gem. Studio apartment with a backyard rent stabilized for $1100 in the best area of NY. Chelsea. But because I don’t make 40x the rent and my mom doesn’t make 80x the rent to be my guarantor I can’t get it unless I find someone who does. I call my aunt and uncle , my half sister, and my other aunt who all make over $100,000 a year. One by one they all respond “I have to think of my own family first and can’t be financially responsible for you.” I thought they were my family. I thought they would care. They knew my mom would’ve covered for me if anything had happened but they didn’t care they wouldn’t sign for me. I attempted to od.  I knew the chances of success were slim but I was desperate. I tell my mom I’m so sorry but I can’t do this anymore. I run into the woods behind our house. I keep running. I see them searching for me. I keep running. Eventually I find a long strong vine. If the pills don’t work.. this will have to do. I put down my coat to lay down for a while I feel weightless but my heat rate very high. I hope to die. But I get up to look for a tree just in case. Then they find me. The police. I had run 5 miles into the woods. They don’t let me go back to get my coat. The ambulance driver said I was lying that I what I took “ Your eyes aren’t  even dilated.” and that they’d spent hours looking for me when they had calls for people with actual emergencies. I told him to fuck off and find someone else to sit in the back with me. They hold me in the ER in a dark cell for hours. I am in and out of consciousness mostly from exhaustion. They tell me I had metabolized the drugs  from all the running. I am involuntarily admitted. The doctor in the ward is a literal sociopath. I ask to be transferred to Pine Grove. He denies my request. He takes me off my antidepressants cold turkey “just as an experiment” I look at him in the eyes and ask why he is smiling does he enjoy my suffering? He says “I’m just a happy person.” I say “ Are you sure you aren’t a sadist, on the spectrum, or a sociopath.” I walk out and demand he release me after my 72 hour hold. He practically ignores me for the next two days. They tell me I can’t cry again here, that I’m disturbing the other patients. I yell after the nurse that they aren’t giving me any help. What am I supposed to do??? She threatens to put me on the violent floor for people who can’t control their emotions for yelling at her. I go back in my room and continue to cry screaming and heaving at the top of my lungs. They let me out after my time is up. 

I tell call my man and tell him what happened. I see him start to cry. I tell him I love him again. He tells me “You can say it now.” He knows it’s real. He didn’t believe logically before but he knows. 

My birthday comes. I’m 26. I’m losing my insurance, my apartment, and I don’t have a job. I have to go back to NY to pack. I continue to look for apartments but the prices are too high. I hate my family for refusing to sign the guarantee and refuse to speak to any of them. My friends offer for me to stay with them in New Jersey. I don’t want it. I cry every night but I don’t have a choice I’m being forced out of my home. The place I had made beautiful and wanted to love for years to come. The realtors come to my apartment almost every night running salt in my wounds showing countless people MY apartment at the new price at $1400 more than I paid. I cry every night. I don’t get out of bed in the day. 
Out of sheer luck I get a job. It’s working from home doing very boring tech work. But at least I don’t have to get out of bed. My mom comes to help me move. I can’t do anything I’m paralyzed. I haven’t showered in a week or more. I eat microwaveable foods. I sit and cry while i shower. Everything sets me off. I look in the mirror and am disgusted at what I see. I’m at least 190 now. My friends make comments about my weight. I can’t even pack a box without having to lay down. My friends call me selfish for making my mom do the work. I can’t make myself. Now I’m staying with one friend until the others apartment is ready in her house. This friend tells me I have to “choose to be happy or go home to Mississippi, because she can’t have her son see me like this.” Im on my second day. Im miserable. My clothes don’t fit. I can’t find my clothes because my mother packed for me. The only thing I remotely look forward to is seeing my man soon. But I dread living in New Jersey with no independence. I don’t want to fight every day. I tell my mom I hate her for calling the cops on me twice and forcing me to live. I don’t want to. I beg for release. I beg her to leg me go. She won’t. SHE is the one that is selfish. I’m in agony. Every day is agony. Everyday for the past two years almost has been agony and I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to be in this body. I don’t want stretch marks. I don’t want a double chin. I don’t want to live in New Jersey. I don’t want depression. I dont want they anxiety, I don’t want the PTSD. And I most certainly don’t want to live. How come it’s my body my choice applies to abortion, but we can’t have autonomy on whether or not we can end our life peacefully? At this points it’s not about the feelings of other people after I’m gone. It’s too painful for me to keep existing like this. Nothing helps. My depression is a void that is never ending nothing makes me happy except being with my guy. But he’s 5000 miles away. I mask it as well as I can but these days, but I barely can force myself to smile. I’m tired of being called selfish. I’m tired. I’m just tired. I don’t want one response saying anything like “there is hope” because NO treatment has helped. I’ve tried everything for 10 years. I hate life. I hate the constant bad things happening to me. An endless barrage of bad. Moving? Let’s break her foot. Moving again? Let’s make her break her tooth in her sleep the night before from stress grinding. Find a perfect apartment? No one trusts her enough to be her guarantor. In love? He lives in a foreign country and won’t say he loves you back. I’m tired. I want the right to die with dignity. I don’t want it to hurt. My independence is taken completely away. I have no other options. 

I don’t know why I felt compelled to write this. Maybe just to share my pain. See how others cope. I don’t see an end. I tried to edit so that I didn’t break and rules mentioning methods. I’ve never told anyone all of this except my mom. I love her. But I’m so mad at her now for forcing me to stay.",t2_82wmgqyv,False,,0,False,I’ve attempted more times than I can count,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tm03g5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648105895.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Nearly an essay) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey start 10 years ago. I was 16. I’d already been diagnosed with Premenstral Dysphoric Disorder at 13 for uncontrollable fits of rage and crying til I was shaking every day a day before my period started. At 15, they tried putting me on the pill. It didn’t help. But I was happy with my boyfriend. I was a straight A student. Beautiful. A ballerina who sang like an Angel. My boyfriend made me happy. He was my dopamine. I was happy and content for a year. We were finally at third base. He felt my boobs under my shirt, I put my hand down his pants and stroked him, he did the same to me. We never were unclothed. But we dry humped like teenagers do. I orgasm for the first time. The second time the third. We go to Disney World. I share a bed with my mom he sleeps on the other. When my mom goes to the bathroom in the morning we steal kisses. I cry tears of joy watching the fireworks with him in front of Cinderella’s castle. I love him deeply. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. And we were close to having sex soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day the next week in July, he called me and tells me “I just don’t love you anymore.” I was devastated. Utterly abysmal in every way. I beg him to explain. He has no explanation. I thought we were perfect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crying myself to sleep every night, sleeping with my mom again because I couldn’t control my constant will to die, my mom started bringing me to therapy. The therapist told me to my face that I was the most depressed individual he had ever seen. A few weeks pass. Endless trials and failures of different antidepressants. I have a major panic attack. I’m screaming out to God on deaf ears “Please take it away. Please make it stop. I don’t want to wake up anymore!” This was the first time I tried, but stopped because it hurt.  I agreed to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t  want to die but I didn’t want to live like this.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They admitted me to the pediatric mental ward. It was HORRIBLE. The first thing they did was strip search me and check every inch of my body for scars or any marks. They pointed out a little white mark on my toes that scarred because of repeated blisters from dancing on pointe and being a ballerina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girls there were violent. They had tried to murder their grandmothers. They had hallucinations of people speaking to them through the tv telling them to stab people. There were daily fights. I felt like I was in prison. Every night I screamed crying in my room. They told me I wasn’t allowed to do that. They told me I couldn’t cry. The doctor told me I was acting like I thought I was better than everyone else. I tell him I’m not like the other girls here. I don’t want to kill any one I just don’t want to live like I am living and want help. He is dismissive. I am released. Nothing is better. If anything it made it worse. Now I had trauma from my time there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 months go by. I am in therapy and a psychiatrist office every week. I still cry every night. I still sleep with my mom because she’s afraid to let me out of her sight during the night. She holds me as I rock back and forth until I finally pass out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex boyfriend ignores me in the hallways. I mourn for him like the grief of a death, and I see his ghost every day. I wear high heels and dress to the nines everyday. All the boys notice me, but him.  I appear bubbly, beautiful, and like I’m a perfect girl, yet I am in agony on the inside. I stare at the walls during AP language just to try to fight the never ending dread. I go to the bathroom to cry. I have a student say to me “Why are you so happy all the time?!” in a mean tone and that “Just being around me makes him feel poor.” I run to the bathroom and break down. I call my mom. After 30 minutes I return to class. I tell the boy that my dad is a used car salesman who sometimes doesn’t even bring home a paycheck. I’m not rich and I’m not as happy as I may seem. Life goes on. I continue the charade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the attention of the foreign exchange student from Spain. I like him back, he’d be a good distraction especially if I could fall for him. He rides his bike over to my house we cuddle and watch movies and end the night in sweet kisses, we go ice skating. He asks me to homecoming by holding up a giant sign in my favorite class dressed up in a suit. I’m happy for a few days. Things are looking up. A little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I see that my ex has been asked to escort one of the girls on the homecoming court. That night, I break. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am screaming, crying shaking, banging my head against the wall hoping I’ll give myself a concussion and not wake up the next day. I run into my dads closet and press my back hard against the door to keep my mom out. I attempt again but it hurts. It hurts too much. My mom is desperately trying to push her way into the closet. My dad comes and eventually gets his hands on me. Slapping  me across the face and grabbing me by the neck and throwing me on the bed because he didn’t know how to stop me and it enraged him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fought back. Once my mom was able to get him to let me go, I ran in the bathroom and locked the door. My mom calls and the police on my dad. My dad convinces the chauvinist southern cop that I was attacking him. I scream that I was defending myself! He says that he doesn’t see any marks on me and that he could just as easily take me to jail. The cop leaves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I go into an episode my dad is violent again. I make sure this time I have red marks on my arms. I rub them where he’d grabbed me to make sure they are still red by the time the cops and ambulance get there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They take me to the ER with my mom. They let my dad off again. The next day I’m escorted by ambulance to a facility 3 hours away called PineGrove. Tiger Woods had gone there for his addiction. It’s really nice and they only take non violent kids. There I found help. They put me on Lexapro. Things started to get better. My parents visit and for the first time in my life I see my father cry. He tells me he’s sorry and how much he loves me and that he just wants me to be happy. I hug my parents. When the social worker comes I tell them that I made it up and that my dad didn’t hit me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go home. The Lexapro puts me on a baseline. I’m not happy. But I’m not screaming in agony every night. My ballet keeps me distracted. I go to homecoming with my beautiful Spaniard boyfriend. I had told him and the other kids at school I had been in the hospital for an ovarian cyst. Eventually we break up. I never really cared that much. He tells people he only dated me to fool around and because I had big boobs. In reality all we ever did was kiss on the front porch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue on. My grades are immaculate. I start dating my boyfriend I had in middle school again. After he had a motorcycle wreck. I love him and he really loves me. He had PTSD from the wreck and is in a cast from the waist up. He self medicated. Our relationship is incredibly volatile. He wasn’t the Shakespeare quoting boy I’d dated at 13, now he was a leather wearing motorcycle riding bad boys. I was still ballet and straight A’s. We date for a year breaking up and getting back together every two weeks. I know he’s on drugs. He lies I believe him. Happiness, mental abuse, manhandling me, slapping me. Steroid rage. High on who knows what. He scares me sometimes but I love him and always get back together with him. He does really love me, we were each other’s first kiss before and first loves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make a high score on the ACT and graduate early. I go to audition for musical theater schools. I’m accepted into NYU with a full tuition scholarship. I’m ecstatic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year together we start having sex. He wasn’t a virgin. He’d cheated on me multiple times. I was. I can’t orgasm. I’m embarrassed. I talk to my new psychiatrist reluctantly. Sex was taboo. I went to church twice a week. I was made to feel like it was reserved for you husband. I am very embaraased to talk about it. She tells me it’s a side effect of the Lexapro. We keep dating it’s June or so of the summer before I leave for college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cheats on me again. He gives me an  incurable STD. This time it’s over. I break up with him. I’m devastated. I feel so dirty. He was supposed to be my forever. We have lunch one last time before I go to college. He gives me a beautiful Pandora bracelet. And tells me he will always love me. I know he will and so will I. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to NYU. I don’t date for two years. I don’t want to tell anyone about my STD. My gynecologist says it’s alright that it’s now undetectable and that this type doesn’t transfer easily anyway from genital to genital because HSV1 really only thrives on the mouth. I haven’t had another outbreak. I eventually start to date again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 I meet a Brazilian billionaire. I fall for him. He could have easily fallen for me… but he held me at arms length. He shows love with his actions but he pushes it away. He doesn’t want a girlfriend. He loses his visa and I tell him… “You know you don’t HAVE to go.” He tells me “I am not ready.” I am heartbroken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start trying to get off the Lexapro. I want to be able to orgasm. I do fine on Wellbutrin and Trintellix but the orgasms don’t return. I graduate. I’ve gained 30 pounds since high school “too fat” by Broadway standards at 150. So I work backstage. I’m exhausted. 6 days a week. I don’t audition. I have lost my confidence. I no longer think I’m beautiful like I was in high school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I go home for the summer between jobs. I finally have a good relationship with my dad. I go back to work. My dad dies suddenly from a heart attack. He was only 66. I went home to stay with my mom for a month before returning for a new show working backstage. My boss is horrible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, I meet a man. He is also from South America, he is a brain surgeon on a brief fellowship in NYC for 3 months. I immediately adore him. But after 4 or 5 dates. I push him away. I didn’t want to be heartbroken like I was with the last guy I’d dated and I knew I would fall in love with him if I kept seeing him and then he would leave. He tells me around Christmas that he can’t stop thinking about me. He wants to come to Mississippi to see me before he goes back. I don’t let him l, but we text, talk, and FaceTime as much as he can being a full time neurosurgeon working at 5 hospital. I think he’s superman. He’s so charming and kind and sweet. I didn’t ever think I’d meet anyone more suited for me than the Brazilian, but I hope this might be it. We make plans for him to come to NY in April. I’d go to South America in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 2020…. The world shuts down. Broadway shuts down. Covid forces me to flee the city. I go back home to my mom down South. My family make rude remarks at Mother’s Day about people getting so much money on unemployment. It hurts me. We don’t leave the house except to go through drive throughs. I can’t see my neurosurgeon. I miss him. The next year is really tough. I’m grieving my dad. I can’t see the man I love. But March 2021, I find a GREAT apartment for $1500 in the best part of the city. A “pandemic deal” they call them. Everyone says that they can only raise raise your rent 5% each year anyway so I’d be fine. I’d made more on unemployment the last year than I had in 3 years of working. My mom comes up to help me move in. I climb on a stool to put a basket on top of the kitchen cabinets…. I fall and break my foot and sprain the other ankle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go back to Mississippi. I can’t walk. I can barely go to the bathroom on my knee scooter because I have an injury on both feet. I have to have surgery. My doctor is rude and had no bedside manner. I feel like a number. Ive gained 30 more pounds. I’m 175. I see stretch marks forming on my body. I’m embarrassed. I hate myself. I don’t know the happy beautiful girl I was at 15. She is a stranger. In my cast I roll into my dads closet again. I can’t control it. I’m in agony is so so many ways. I’ve lost so much. I attempt again. It hurts. I stop. I make at least 3 more half hearted attempts that summer only leaving wells and bruises on my head. Unable to walk. Miserable and fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally can walk. I get to see the man I love for the first time in person in 2 years. I tell him that I’ve gained weight over the pandemic at this point about 30 pounds. He says he doesn’t care and that I’m still beautiful. We go to Disney World. But he is different than the first time we were together. He used hadn’t been able to keep his hands off me in NY. We’d had sex 3 times a night without stopping. Now he wouldn’t even make out with me in bed. I feel unwanted. Is it my body? I ask crying. He says it’s just weird that we don’t really KNOW each other in person and he doesn’t know how to react. I wonder if he had erectile dysfunction. I thought this was going to be a honeymoon like trip. That he’d finally tell me he loved me, but no. We had fun, but we had quick sex one time that week. Despite my efforts and beautiful lingerie. I suspect he may be an autistic savant. Masking so well that no one except those that are closest to him can tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go back to work backstage when Broadway opens. They worked me 90 hours one week. The actors treat me like I am less than them. They act like I’m their maid and unimportant. I forget how much more talented I am than them. I sing like a nightingale and am a classically trained ballerina. They make me fell worthless. I sprain my ankle backstage. I’m already suicidal. I quit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days later. My ex boyfriend. My first love, the bad boy, overdosed on Spiked meth and died. I was devastated. I was already suicidal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t walk again. I have lost so much. I don’t want to work in theater anymore the man I love isn’t affectionate. I’m now 185 pounds. My stretch marks are purple and red all over my belly. I don’t have a job. I don’t know what to do about the man I love. He still plans to come in December. But I’m prepared for another disappointment. I can’t find the will to live. I start to prepare another attempt. I call my mom I tell her  my plan and that i can’t keep doing this and this will be painless. She calls the police. 30 police show up and involuntarily commit me to a psychiatric ward in New York City. She flies up. I hate her for taking away my choice. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I fake it to get out of the hospital. Tell them I didn’t have intent. I had even asked if the item was returnable when I bought it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am out in 3 days. I tell my man what happened being open for the first time about my mental illness . He is distraught but as a doctor he understands I can’t control it. I get ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression. They help me to not be suicidal almost immediately. He comes up and my mom flies out the same day. They get to meet. My mom loves him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we were alone he rips off my clothes, I think this is going to be much better than the last vacation, but he is quick and I am dry. No foreplay but I just wanted to feel close to him and wanted him. I want him inside me forever. I want him forever. We have an amazing time together the next couple of days. I try to initiate again in the bubble bath but suddenly the water turning back on because I was cold completely takes him out of it. We go to sleep. The next night I dress up in head to toe red lingerie. A corset and long flowing robe. I look like something out of a magazine. I have my hair done in 1940s waves and professional level makeup. I light candles. I keep trying to kiss him. He doesn’t seem interested I demand to know what is wrong. I tell him I’m in love with him. He looks at me confused like he couldn’t possibly understand why I “thought I loved him.” “We haven’t spent enough time together for you to love me.” I tell him i do. I tell him I want to spend my life with him. I want his beautiful smart babies. I want him body and soul. And he won’t even have sex with me. I ask why?!? “Do you have erectile dysfunction? Are you not attracted to me?!” He says he doesn’t have a problem and that he just thinks the word love means that he’s ready to get married and we haven’t spent a month together in person, though we’d been in a relationship for 2 years. I tell him I want to be exclusive. He agrees. I tell him that I’d tried to date after he rejected me in Disney world but no one would ever compare to him. He understands and agrees that he doesn’t want to see other people. I am crying. I snap at him to blow out the candles. I go to cry in the bath tub. I know he hears me. I calm down eventually. I come out and he is rolled over. The candles are blown out. I wrap my arms around him and tell him that I want to work things out. And that because I love him I want to be there for him until he can get his license here. He rolls over and holds me through the night. We are happy. He makes me happy. I talk to my psychiatrist. We both confirm that there’s a high probability that he is autistic. I accept it. It helps me understand him better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go home for Christmas. Omicron surges. I’m afraid to go back to the city. 
In January, I get word form my landlord that it’s time to renew my lease. They’re raising my rent $800. I don’t have a job. It’s perfectly legal. I am having my home ripped away from me. I start searching for apartments online I can’t job search in NY if I don’t have a place to live by he end of March. I find the PERFECT apartment. It’s a rare rare gem. Studio apartment with a backyard rent stabilized for $1100 in the best area of NY. Chelsea. But because I don’t make 40x the rent and my mom doesn’t make 80x the rent to be my guarantor I can’t get it unless I find someone who does. I call my aunt and uncle , my half sister, and my other aunt who all make over $100,000 a year. One by one they all respond “I have to think of my own family first and can’t be financially responsible for you.” I thought they were my family. I thought they would care. They knew my mom would’ve covered for me if anything had happened but they didn’t care they wouldn’t sign for me. I attempted to od.  I knew the chances of success were slim but I was desperate. I tell my mom I’m so sorry but I can’t do this anymore. I run into the woods behind our house. I keep running. I see them searching for me. I keep running. Eventually I find a long strong vine. If the pills don’t work.. this will have to do. I put down my coat to lay down for a while I feel weightless but my heat rate very high. I hope to die. But I get up to look for a tree just in case. Then they find me. The police. I had run 5 miles into the woods. They don’t let me go back to get my coat. The ambulance driver said I was lying that I what I took “ Your eyes aren’t  even dilated.” and that they’d spent hours looking for me when they had calls for people with actual emergencies. I told him to fuck off and find someone else to sit in the back with me. They hold me in the ER in a dark cell for hours. I am in and out of consciousness mostly from exhaustion. They tell me I had metabolized the drugs  from all the running. I am involuntarily admitted. The doctor in the ward is a literal sociopath. I ask to be transferred to Pine Grove. He denies my request. He takes me off my antidepressants cold turkey “just as an experiment” I look at him in the eyes and ask why he is smiling does he enjoy my suffering? He says “I’m just a happy person.” I say “ Are you sure you aren’t a sadist, on the spectrum, or a sociopath.” I walk out and demand he release me after my 72 hour hold. He practically ignores me for the next two days. They tell me I can’t cry again here, that I’m disturbing the other patients. I yell after the nurse that they aren’t giving me any help. What am I supposed to do??? She threatens to put me on the violent floor for people who can’t control their emotions for yelling at her. I go back in my room and continue to cry screaming and heaving at the top of my lungs. They let me out after my time is up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell call my man and tell him what happened. I see him start to cry. I tell him I love him again. He tells me “You can say it now.” He knows it’s real. He didn’t believe logically before but he knows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My birthday comes. I’m 26. I’m losing my insurance, my apartment, and I don’t have a job. I have to go back to NY to pack. I continue to look for apartments but the prices are too high. I hate my family for refusing to sign the guarantee and refuse to speak to any of them. My friends offer for me to stay with them in New Jersey. I don’t want it. I cry every night but I don’t have a choice I’m being forced out of my home. The place I had made beautiful and wanted to love for years to come. The realtors come to my apartment almost every night running salt in my wounds showing countless people MY apartment at the new price at $1400 more than I paid. I cry every night. I don’t get out of bed in the day. 
Out of sheer luck I get a job. It’s working from home doing very boring tech work. But at least I don’t have to get out of bed. My mom comes to help me move. I can’t do anything I’m paralyzed. I haven’t showered in a week or more. I eat microwaveable foods. I sit and cry while i shower. Everything sets me off. I look in the mirror and am disgusted at what I see. I’m at least 190 now. My friends make comments about my weight. I can’t even pack a box without having to lay down. My friends call me selfish for making my mom do the work. I can’t make myself. Now I’m staying with one friend until the others apartment is ready in her house. This friend tells me I have to “choose to be happy or go home to Mississippi, because she can’t have her son see me like this.” Im on my second day. Im miserable. My clothes don’t fit. I can’t find my clothes because my mother packed for me. The only thing I remotely look forward to is seeing my man soon. But I dread living in New Jersey with no independence. I don’t want to fight every day. I tell my mom I hate her for calling the cops on me twice and forcing me to live. I don’t want to. I beg for release. I beg her to leg me go. She won’t. SHE is the one that is selfish. I’m in agony. Every day is agony. Everyday for the past two years almost has been agony and I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to be in this body. I don’t want stretch marks. I don’t want a double chin. I don’t want to live in New Jersey. I don’t want depression. I dont want they anxiety, I don’t want the PTSD. And I most certainly don’t want to live. How come it’s my body my choice applies to abortion, but we can’t have autonomy on whether or not we can end our life peacefully? At this points it’s not about the feelings of other people after I’m gone. It’s too painful for me to keep existing like this. Nothing helps. My depression is a void that is never ending nothing makes me happy except being with my guy. But he’s 5000 miles away. I mask it as well as I can but these days, but I barely can force myself to smile. I’m tired of being called selfish. I’m tired. I’m just tired. I don’t want one response saying anything like “there is hope” because NO treatment has helped. I’ve tried everything for 10 years. I hate life. I hate the constant bad things happening to me. An endless barrage of bad. Moving? Let’s break her foot. Moving again? Let’s make her break her tooth in her sleep the night before from stress grinding. Find a perfect apartment? No one trusts her enough to be her guarantor. In love? He lives in a foreign country and won’t say he loves you back. I’m tired. I want the right to die with dignity. I don’t want it to hurt. My independence is taken completely away. I have no other options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I felt compelled to write this. Maybe just to share my pain. See how others cope. I don’t see an end. I tried to edit so that I didn’t break and rules mentioning methods. I’ve never told anyone all of this except my mom. I love her. But I’m so mad at her now for forcing me to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I think overall I'm doing ""better"" than ever but I feel like everyday I'm finding more and more reasons for suicide. I don't know, it's been fucking with me that even when I'm feeling good, suicide still sounds pretty fine but just in those moods, I don't feel like doing it. 

I've always seen my flaws but I've never felt so trapped by them. My inadequacy is further defining my life and its really hard to accept that.

I'm a fuck up in school. Getting a jerkoff, laughable major that will not feel like an accomplishment if I get it, nor will anyone respect it. Took 2 years of classes in an actual real major just to be proved to myself that I am in fact, confirmed, no question about it, fuck off if you try to argue this, retarded. Not to mention, I don't even have a minor to show for it, but everyone else thinks I do because imagine being so worthless and retarded that you waste 2 years and a bunch of money to fail out of a degree and not even have a minor.

I'm lying to everyone I care about because it would be too embarrassing to do otherwise. This just shows how pathetic I am and how much I am a piece of shit to my parents who are the best fucking people on the planet.

My mistakes keep coming back to cause problems so to every therapist ever, shut the fuck up about me forgiving myself. If the world can't forgive why should I?

I'm not excited about life. It's not even a depressed edgy thing it just makes sense when I think about it. It's not the stupid narcissism route of ""nothing matters in the end"" or stupid emo goth thing of ""life is pain"". It's just that, I don't know what to look forward to.

 I decided a while ago that I don't want a family for several reasons. As time passes on, I have less and less patience for people and I somehow have become even more selective in who I choose to be around. My hobbies are defeating me and I dont enjoy them most of the time. I love my family and friends, but as fucked up as it is to say, I've accepted leaving them long ago and they're not worth staying for. Traveling always seemed like one thing that would really make me want to stay here. But as I thought about it, whats so great about it? I mean, you go somewhere and look around at an area that's foreign and participate in their culture but is that A.) worth staying for and B.) actually worth doing? It's always food, do whatever quirk about the place, look around, and intake art. Just seems repetitive, unfulfilling, and boring.

My opinions on people have always changed between positive and negative, but some opinions have always sticked. A lot of people are unoriginal and bland, which honestly isn't a problem, except that means they're boring, and for the most part, disingenuous. 

The other opinion that's always been true is that they're annoying. Holy fuck are people annoying. They all just have their own quirk that sucks, whether its not shutting the fuck up, acting cringey, being uninteresting, being lifeless, being attention seeking, grabbing their personality and vocabulary from the internet (to the point where I don't understand them. No seriously, I had to ask someone to tell me what they just said in nonfucking tiktok speak and their body language slumped and they told me again in normal English all for an unfunny joke), or just overall being annoying.

I don't think I'm cool for thinking these things, in fact it's quite the opposite. I truly wish I didn't feel this way and I've been told by many people that its frustrating I'm like this.

This brings me to another thought which is that I am boring, unoriginal, and annoying. Seems pretty fitting, maybe I project onto people. But yeah, I'm all these things and I got proof. 

The boring one is pretty straightforward. I started to go to the radio club's parties and I often find people not really continuing to talk to me after we met. Theyre all really nice people, some of the nicest in fact, so the ""they're just assholes"" thing I refuse to accept. I mean I'm not upset with them. If I were dealing with a boring person and I can get away from them, I will, but if they come up to me I'll be nice but try to get out of that convo quick. Also my whole girls situation is another good piece of proof. Alright, we all do the match, snap, ghost thing so I'm not talking about that, although it does help my case a bit, but rather girls ghosting after a date. In the past 5 years, the best that I've done is have a girl hit me up every once in awhile because I think she either wanted to fuck (honestly didn't seem that eager to but it would happen sometimes) or because she felt lonely. Most situations are girls disappearing after saying they'd like to schedule another date. Again, I'm not upset with them. If I was in their situation, I can't bring myself to say no to seeing them again if they ask and I wouldn't know what would be a good exit plan. But yeah, this proves I'm not interesting enough for these people to warrant another date or just be friends which is what I'm fine with too (I also suspect that they do this because they realize how fat I am but that's a whole other thing).

The unoriginal part is evident in how I act, my manner of speaking, my thoughts, my overall personality, my sense of humor, and how I dress. Not really anything anyone could pinpoint about me that's original and I've been called a poser. Proof is in the mirror and hearing what others say about me.

Finally, how annoying I am. I've gotten this my whole life. I get it. I'm loud and obnoxious and that shit stopped being cute in 2nd grade. Even aside from that, I kinda just will be annoying when I'm talking. I think I try too hard in every aspect, humor, conversation topics, insight, opinions. There's other things too, but I'm tired and can't think. Again, the proof is in what other people say. We can't trust our own positive opinions because we are all wired to suck our own dicks that's why other people's opinions are crucial.

I guess I just thought things were suppose to be better. When I was younger, I never thought things would get better and maybe I'm right. But after getting meds and therapy, things did improve. Or at least that's what it looked like because now it just seems like everything still sucks but in a new way. It really feels like same depression but now in color. Everything seems new but foreign like I'm not suppose to be here. I mean I feel good some days, but those thoughts are still there. When I get low, everything makes sense and I feel like this is what's actually happening I just felt good at the time so it was blurred.

I really feel like I'm marching forward but not making any progress and with no purpose other than ""I'm suppose to"". I'm either hoping that I find a purpose for living or get the courage to stop.

,depression,"So.. I had a really, really rough childhood growing up. My parents were abusive to me, and I lived in an area where I got into a lot of fistfights. Trying to make it to the next day was the hardest battle. I attempted suicide by trying to hang myself when I was 15-16, I think. The attempt failed, however. It left me with some minor brain damage. I have a very difficult time trying to remember things and think about things sometimes. At times, it feels like I can't even read English. It just.. doesn't click with me.

,depression,"I’ve been trying to walk forward despite everything. But I feel like I’m out of options and got no help. So I’m here trying to figure out if my situation is as bad as it seems to me…

I am a classical musician, not from the US, trained in a conservatory since I was a child and over the years got to play and perform wonderful music in different countries, and finished two master’s degrees in the US. I graduated the last one just as the pandemic started and eventually married my US citizen boyfriend. The application for a green card is gonna take a few months (at least six) so I have no access to health insurance or Medicaid or really anything that isn’t out of pocket and super expensive. I haven’t had a single job or real performance in two years and my playing has declined over this time, which makes it even harder to find a job in the future when I get the green card. Not that there are any opportunities around me anyway, nobody seems to care about classical music. 

Im feeling like i spent so many years and made so many sacrifices (my childhood and teenage years and friends, for example) just to be able to play music that nobody wants to hear. I know I could play arrangements of popular songs but that just makes me wanna cry, All the hard work feels so wasted on that and it brings me no joy to play music i don’t like.

I have hit the point now where I am really wondering what the point of it all is. I'm very tired, I feel like I've been running forever. My medical bills are continuing to pile up. I haven't been working because of my medical issues so money has become my biggest 'real life' issue. My relationships with family and friends are deteriorating so quickly I don't even know how to stop it. My education proved to be the biggest waste of time. My work skills are so unremarkable that I cant get anything more than a warehouse job. I'm a complete definition of a loser. I feel like my life is spiraling out of control. It feels like it's all my fault and I know it is. I just don't know how to fix anything. And these random events keep happening to me that make me question if maybe it is just some cosmic entity screwing with me because every time I tried to do something for someone else or tried just taking actions to do better somehow it ended up in failure. 

I tried getting a new job and I unfortunately my medical problems hit, causing me to lose that new job just a month after getting it. Prior to that I took a ""better"" job offer only to get hit with even worse working conditions for an additional $1.50, hence me leaving to try to get a new job. Or how about the two times I went Christmas shopping for my family, I had to replace two tires on my car. One each time I went out I mysteriously got a flat tire that went unnoticed both times, resulting in me having to buy new ones because the sidewalls were screwed. Or my favorite one, I decided to take a trip to another state on a whim one weekend for a concert. At that time I had felt that I was at the lowest I could get so I said screw it and decided to go. I decided to go out the night before to check out the city, and found a local band playing a bar. I ordered a beer and the next thing I remember is waking up in a hospital. They proceeded to then let me just leave the hospital and I wandered the city with a dead phone for a few hours looking for my car to go home. I got a lot of nice thoughts from family and friends initially but then the jokey, ""So you didn't get raped did you?"" and then just laughing it off, most likely because I'm a male. I honestly don't know if I did, I remember nothing, and I would rather it just stay that way. 

Everything I do in my life seems to result in the worst possible outcome. Whether it's my fault noticeably or whether I want to blame the void for all my problems. The outcome is still the same and my pile of problems doesn't change. I Just want to do right but I can't seem to do that. I want to give up completely. Every time I think things can't get worse they do. 

This isn't a final post or anything like that. I just want to scream. Everyone looks and talks to me like I'm some stooge and maybe I am but damnit I just want people to care.

No periods that last for weeks, or months, like I did when I first started having symptoms 40 years ago.  Thank god it is mostly occasional bad bouts, most often I just have a dull low depression that I can dell with using, moving muscles, using cognitive disputes.

Today I had one of the rare events that I used to get often.  I wake up early have a cup or two of coffee, yet I feel really exhausted.  (I slept fine the night before).  I end up having breakfast, but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and I go back to bet by 9AM.  The entire day consists of me sleeping, having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dreams.  The dreams are not nightmares, in fact they are rather creative, but the locals and situations are like the came from somebodies imagination in a distant galaxy.  They would make really interesting sci-fi fantasy.  I also dream about being lonely, I have no family, few friends, one thing I remember was this gut wrenching sadness about a girl I dated over 40 years ago, thought she was the one, but it fell apart.

After about 10 to 12 hours I get up, have something to eat.  I feel hung over, an d it is like a storm passed through my brain, spent it's energy and now calm has returned.

,depression,"Everyone I have ever met in my life has told me that I'm beautiful. Some, even the most beautiful that they have ever seen.

All my life, I've expected the rest of the world to bow down before my beauty and tell me that I'm beautiful. I always rely on that validation and reassurance. I keep on waiting for people to tell me that I'm beautiful. I keep track of who tells me I'm beautiful and who hasn't. For those who haven't, I wonder if they think I'm beautiful.

This happened with my 50 year old same sex female teacher. I was expecting her to tell me that I'm beautiful even as she was rejecting me, and I noticed that she didn't tell me what I wanted to hear, and just pointed out aspects about my personality. I was crying over it.

My own thinking has led to me having many problems in life. I lack even the most basic common sense, even when something is so obvious. Like, flying to Germany and showing up unannounced at the airport asking to be picked up at 11 PM and expecting to free load for two weeks with relatives I haven't seen in 17 years over Christmas. Being invited to a friend's birthday party and not even talking to her and wondering why she became cold to me.

Even at work, When toothpicks fell, I was picking them up to put them back on the bottle. I was stacking clothes that they kept on falling. My coworkers who are younger than me helped me and their minds are more mature than mine. When my former professor 40 years my senior told me he loved me and that I was the most beautiful woman he has ever met, I was blown away. I was so distracted by him telling me that I was beautiful that I could not see that he could have been lying.

I have received a couple of complaints about my personality. Someone told me, ""Yes, you are beautiful in looks, BUT UGLY AS HELL AT HEART. You are narcissistic and manipulative. You surely do act like the world revolves around you. Another person has told me, ""You told me that you are 27. When I was talking to you, I felt like I was talking to a 16-year-old. You are a very immature woman, and you're not that bright either."" Is this why I don't have any friends?

•My boyfriend is in jail. Not sure how long. Months? Idk.
• I live in our house with our 11 year old. (He’s my sisters kid but I have custody)
• My best friend has depression, and her boyfriend struggles with drugs and she works a very full time job. She doesn’t reply much to me anymore.

• I miss my other best friend. I saved all of our videos and pictures. She was my best friend from around 2016-2018
I was in a very toxic relationship and she constantly tried to break us up, rightfully so. Once I finally broke up with him...the girl and I we fine, we were great! One night we went to a party and then the next day I went home and wrote her a long text telling her she was toxic towards her boyfriend. We got into a huge fight. Then they started stupid rumors about me trying to get with her bf. Wasn’t true. Then...I went 100 steps too far. I got with this new guy who was total GANG GANG and a snow addict at the time. I knew a window in her house was broke and could always open. While she was at school my new man and his friend robbed her house. And by rob I mean only took the bongs and weed. That was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. The whole time it happened I sat at home have an anxiety attack because I wanted to tell my man nevermind but I didn’t want him to think “less of me”. How fucking cool of me. I have a very guilty conscience and I’m empathetic as fuck. I ended up telling her the truth. She already knew, she’s not stupid. I knew she wanted to kill me the moment I confessed to her face. A week later I ended up giving her $200-$300 to make up for what was taken.

My manager hasn't really noticed because I'll get the things done that they need. But I'm in a really bad place, mentally, this week. And I have done almost no work on a big project that I need to finish by tomorrow. I've been debating going out on FMLA for the last few weeks. But I have to use up all of my vacation time if I do go out.

,depression,"
It all started a couple years ago when I was 23 about to start a new job. I was lucky and bet that the stock market would go down with the few thousand dollars I made from my internship. Of course this was when Covid was just hitting so I became hugely profitable. From only a couple thousand dollars to $2m in value in only a month. Thinking back on it, I was crazy reckless. I made my first million, and then less than a week later I made my second million. I was feeling incredible, thought I could retire and never have to work again… but like all gamblers I kept putting my money in trying to make more and more. Of course with the risks I was taking eventually it would all come crashing down.

Fast forward today, I’m now 62k in debt plus another 20k in student loans. On the surface, my friends think I’m hugely successful because I flexed I made $2m to them (didn’t spend a dime though, just kept trying to make more and more). I also make $200k a year (100k salary with  the rest as a one time bonus) but only have $2 in my bank account currently.

I no longer play in the stock market but have recently been doing sports gambling. Of course, I keep losing money on that. There are times that I go on a nice streak, but it’s like every time I lose, I keep trying to make back my losses which makes me do even dumber plays.

I’m not sure what I’m expecting by writing this, but I feel so embarrassed to tell the people I’m close with. My girlfriend of multiple years knows that I no longer have a lot of money, but don’t know I’m in debt. My parents are super supportive, but I’m too embarrassed to tell them how bad my situation is.

I guess that’s why I’m writing to a bunch of strangers online. I know my pursuit of trying to make back my money is wrong, but I can’t stop trying to get out of debt. I feel so dumb, it’s like I see a rock in front of me but I keep on tripping over it.

It feels like I’m slowly unraveling and feeling incredibly hopeless. I can’t sleep thinking about how my life has gone downhill in such a short period of time. My younger self would be straight up embarrassed if he could see me now. I don’t have suicidal thoughts yet but no longer feel the same motivation in life that I used to.

,depression,"So My latest suicide attempt, I sent a goodbye text message to a group of my friends. I then planned on overdosing, until I got a call from my mom and a bunch of text messages saying “don’t do it” and implying that things will get better and no one would be better without me yadda yadda. After listening to my mom I didn’t go through with taking my life. I ended up in another psych ward and to top it all off I got covid. I hate being inpatient, but to be confided into one room with someone watching me all the time made things even worse. The only good thing was they made an exception to the phone policy for me. For whatever reason, the psych there wouldn’t give me an essential medication because he “didn’t like it.” Needless to say, I was an utter wreck in the ward, and who could blame me. I admittedly texted some concerning stuff to one of my ex-friends because of how much stress i was under. (It wasn’t anything manipulative, mostly self-deprecating stuff) I believe these texts sent him over the edge and he has now decided to cut ties with me. This was one of the people who said “no one would be better without you.” Him cutting ties with me has made the other people in that friend group also cut ties with me.

,depression,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

I just graduated with an advanced degree and got into job search. I've been struggling with depression for years, and I think at first it was the high-functioning kind, but in the last few years it seemed to have turned to the demotivational kind of depression. I'm tired all the time, and I always pick the easy things to do: easy entertainment (watch things mindlessly), easy way to go to sleep (scroll on my phone until I'm too tired to stay awake), etc. It comes and goes in waves, too. Sometimes I'd get the energy to do things or to do something along the lines of self-improvement. Other times, I would just want to sleep. 

I've learned that some things trigger depressive episodes much faster than others, but I'm not sure how to let these triggers pass without the episode full-on hitting me. For instance, one of the triggers is a perceived sense of being excluded from things or being ""rejected"" or being shown or told that I'm not good enough. Can you tell that I suffer from an inferiority complex? Anyway, today, that trigger came from one of my tennis-group friends, who wanted to set up a play session every two weeks for advanced players in our amateur tennis group. This doesn't conflict with any of our other scheduled play sessions, and I know that I'm not good enough to be in the advanced group. All of my tennis friends are good people, and I know that there's always going to be room in the advanced group for people who improve and get to that level. Even knowing all this, I got so depressed over the span of about 3 minutes that I just stopped functioning. I think that since this group of friends has been my only real support for the last few years, anything that happens in the group that I see as a rejection of myself just instantly takes me down. Now that I'm in the middle of it, it feels like the only thing I can do is wait for it to pass, because ""talking out of it"" or ""building myself up"" don't work when all I can think about is how I've failed everything and that I've never and will never live up to anyone's standards, including my own.

I&amp;#39;m tired all the time, and I always pick the easy things to do: easy entertainment (watch things mindlessly), easy way to go to sleep (scroll on my phone until I&amp;#39;m too tired to stay awake), etc. It comes and goes in waves, too. Sometimes I&amp;#39;d get the energy to do things or to do something along the lines of self-improvement. Other times, I would just want to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve learned that some things trigger depressive episodes much faster than others, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to let these triggers pass without the episode full-on hitting me. For instance, one of the triggers is a perceived sense of being excluded from things or being &amp;quot;rejected&amp;quot; or being shown or told that I&amp;#39;m not good enough. Can you tell that I suffer from an inferiority complex? Anyway, today, that trigger came from one of my tennis-group friends, who wanted to set up a play session every two weeks for advanced players in our amateur tennis group. This doesn&amp;#39;t conflict with any of our other scheduled play sessions, and I know that I&amp;#39;m not good enough to be in the advanced group. All of my tennis friends are good people, and I know that there&amp;#39;s always going to be room in the advanced group for people who improve and get to that level. Even knowing all this, I got so depressed over the span of about 3 minutes that I just stopped functioning. I think that since this group of friends has been my only real support for the last few years, anything that happens in the group that I see as a rejection of myself just instantly takes me down. Now that I&amp;#39;m in the middle of it, it feels like the only thing I can do is wait for it to pass, because &amp;quot;talking out of it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;building myself up&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t work when all I can think about is how I&amp;#39;ve failed everything and that I&amp;#39;ve never and will never live up to anyone&amp;#39;s standards, including my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long selfish post - I&amp;#39;m struggling daily with Imposter Syndrome and a sense of inadequacy. The trigger just happened to be this particular thing today.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I live at home, and I love my parents but I’m beginning to spiral. 

After an incident 8 months ago I’ve been profoundly depressed and stressed out, I was renting but moved back home to save money while trying to get myself back in order. 
Especially because my meds stopped working.

I’m an only child and my parents have no friends, so, now that I’m back home all they want to do is constantly talk to me.

I already have poor sleep as it is, but it could be 5am and my dad will shake me awake to talk about a car, or his work day-
Or my mom will come in and talk to me about my finances or why I never talk to her about my mental health. 
One time recently I had been woken up so abruptly I could feel my entire nervous system jolt like I had been struck by lighting.
Even thinking about it makes my entire body randomly hurt.
I never get to be alone anymore, I try to get alone time but I never get it for more than a couple hours at an time.

Bc of the sleep deprivation I hallucinate now, I hear and see things.

,depression,"So I (24m) have been feeling down rather often the last few years, but these last few month im feeling constantly down. My life just feels stuck. Everyday when my alarm rings i just cant get out of bed, even tho i usually sleep for 8 hours or so. I end up laying in bed for 1, 2 or 3 hours, thinking about how shitty my life is and how i dont make progress at all. I also get suicidal thoughts alot, even tho i dont have any intention to harm myself in any way. I dont want to die, but smh my brain doesnt get that.

So yesterday i decided to finally get help and call my doc for an appointment. Before making that call i sat there and stared at the number, contemplating if i really wanted to do this. I made a list and wrote down reasons why i want to get help and reasons why i dont. Everything just pointed to me making that call and after 2 hours i finally pressed call.

So then i was on the phone with a woman at my doctors office. I told her with a kinda shaky voice that i would like an appointment. She asked  what it was about and i told her that i felt rather bad lately had trouble sleeping and am feeling tired alot(i didnt feel comfortable sharing that i feel depressed). She said she doesnt have a free spot in the next few weeks and told me i should come in without an appointment on thursday or friday.

So now im here without an appointment contemplating if i should actually go there tomorrow. It kinda sucks, that im in the situation before the phonecall again, where i have to make that decision to get help. 
Im so nervous about getting help. I dont know what i should even say. I dont know how to talk about my feelings. I dont even know if ill make it out of bed tonorrow, before the doctors office closes.

,depression,"So I've been working really hard this last year on overcoming MDD, agoraphobia, and social issues. Over the last 2 years, I've gone from making it out of the house for 1-2 hours a month(long enough to go to the doctor and grocery shopping) to managing 6-10 hours a week. I'm still working up to doing things on successive days, it usually takes a day or so to recover otherwise things start getting rough, but it's significantly better than before.

(Not advocating this approach, it's what worked for me and may not work for others. I had a lot of sensitivity to what was being prescribed and it was causing more harm than good. Talk with a professional before doing anything medication related). Part of what seemed to help was getting away from medications. Over 6 years we tried 14 or so different things and it just didn't work well. Now the hardest thing I do is caffeine and multivitamins.( There is a noticable difference in energy levels and depression if I go more than a few days without vitamins, so if you aren't taking any you may want to look into them). 

I had been pushing things the last couple months, and was starting to have burnout issues. It was hard not to as I felt like I was starting to break through things. I'm working at a different approach now, just going until I start to feel uncomfortable and stopping if it's feasible, rather than pushing until I have a full panic episode. I'm not getting as much done every day, but so far I'm starting each day more consistently. Its a little difficult stopping when I feel like I can keep going, but I'm hopeful that the better consistency will be more productive in the long term. 

As bad as things were a couple years ago to where they are now gives me hope for others too. I was going to bed praying for death and cursing every morning I woke up. I have hope and have truly started to love myself. If you're going through a hard time, things can get better!

I have stage 5 kidney disease. I can't work, I feel like garbage all the fucking time. Last year I passed out and broke my face. I can't stop thinking about blacking out like that again and never waking up. I fantasize about it every day.

I'm seeing therapists, I've gone to partial hospitalization for anxiety, nothing will work though because I'm totally broken and unfixable. I'm not worth fixing, nor do I know how.

None of this matters when I'm expected to pick up the slack for my family and their failings. 

My sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My parents have no idea how to deal with it, having lived with chronic depression their entire lives and relying on faith to get them through. She's refusing treatment, medication and in denial of her condition. It's a constant cycle of her being unstable, hospitalized until shes able to manipulate the doctors that she's okay and goes home to torment us. 

My brother is leaving his military job after 16 years and freaking out because he doesn't think he'll survive as a civilian. I'm fairly certain he has his own mental issues, stemming from way back but he's also just barnacled on to me for guidance. 

I wanted to kill myself. I was about to. And I called and got help, and I've been on medication for 4 years. I struggled with alcoholism in my early 20s and decided to stay sober for my daughter.  And I'm finding it hard to hang on with all of this going on. I'm finding it hard to help people who don't want to help themselves but if I don't, then everything just goes to hell. And I'm the one to blame because I'm the smart one and have to guide everyone where they're supposed to go.

It's taking a toll on my marriage, and I am scared of the consequences of what that would entail.  I worry for my child, because if I can't take care of myself, then I can't take care of her.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m staring at the same abyss that was before me those 4 years ago when I was spiraling. And I don&amp;#39;t want to be here again. 
Anyway, thanks for hearing me out, Reddit. I just needed to verbalize it to make sure I&amp;#39;m not just imagining it all.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
My moods change fast and I don’t think I am bipolar as it’s usually a reason why my mood changes and it can all change in a day. Like I’m in a good mood and then like couple hours past and I just get negative thoughts and I’m down again. 

Like I already lost people this year, my ex best friend, who used to be my best friend like 2 years ago and losing him as a friend this year didn’t really hurt as it was my decision to cut him out of my life. He was a real bad narcissist and probably a sociopath so cutting him out felt good. The one thing that hurts is losing my sister as we used to be so close but recently she became a lot more social and has a lot of friends and she doesn’t even want to speak to me or spend time with me anymore even though I’m the older sibling. I’m 23 and she’s 20. 

It’s just scary how easy people can just leave your life and even though I have a best friend that is good to me and I am talking to a girl but I’m just worried it will end as I’m just bad with my emotions probably because of my anxiety. 

I’m really not sure how I can get better. Like sometimes I feel great it feels like euphoric even, like I’m more hyper, talkative and confident but it never lasts long. And then I’m just back to my usual mood just being sad, depressed and anxious. I know somethings wrong with me probably, I tried cbt therapy for anxiety and depression but it didn’t really help me. I’m on an antidepressant as well which has never worked on me I just take it as it makes me sleep. 

I hate living like this I just want to smoke weed and get drunk so that I can stop all the negative thoughts and I hate it. It feels like my life is a mess.

,depression,"Hi;   I was wondering if anyone has this happen to them.  I have have had  depression for decades, I have good days and bad days.  No periods that  last for weeks, or months, like I did when I first started having  symptoms 40 years ago.  Thank god it is mostly occasional bad bouts,  most often I just have a dull low depression that I can dell with using,  moving muscles, using cognitive disputes.

Today  I had one of the rare events that I used to get often.  I wake up early  have a cup or two of coffee, yet I feel really exhausted.  (I slept  fine the night before).  I end up having breakfast, but that exhausted  feeling becomes overwhelming and I go back to bet by 9AM.  The entire  day consists of me sleeping, having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dreams.   The dreams are not nightmares, in fact they are rather creative, but  the locals and situations are like the came from somebodies imagination  in a distant galaxy.  They would make really interesting sci-fi fantasy.   I also dream about being lonely, I have no family, few friends, one  thing I remember was this gut wrenching sadness about a girl I dated  over 40 years ago, thought she was the one, but it fell apart.

After  about 10 to 12 hours I get up, have something to eat.  I feel hung  over, an d it is like a storm passed through my brain, spent it's energy  and now calm has returned.

I was  wondering if anyone else had had similar experiences like this?  It  would be concerning if it was a frequent occurrence, which it once was  in the early days of depression, again that was decades ago.

I usually use a low glycemic berry, oatmilk and kale or spinach. Protein powder is good also, to add a bit more calories. Chia seeds for the fiber, to keep you satiated longer.

Again very little prep time and you’re not actually eating, just drinking. Bone broth alone has very little calories, but the protein content will help your malfunctioning brain work a bit better.

But at the end of the day, I found myself drinking and smoking by myself again(i stopped smoking for a year and a half until last month). Me right now is exactly the person im trying to get rid of 3 years ago. After 3 years I found myself doing all the things i hate and i know it is bad for me again.

,depression,"I’m 20, and have never even been on a date with a girl before. Everything has just gone wrong growing up. There were so many times where things almost changed, almost got in a group of people I wanted to be with, almost would no longer have been alone.  But every time, something at the last second happens and I lose it forever. Sometimes my fault, but usually not.  I’ve stopped getting my hopes up for anything. I know it will always just never work out. It’s like I’m destined to just always be like this.

I had a few “friends” in high school.  No one I could ever connect with though. I didn’t care though, maybe I could meet new people through them. But for some reason, anytime anything interesting would happen with them, it was when I was gone. Anytime I am with them, same usual boring shit. I’m not there? Something crazy happens.

I started going to college recently.  I really was hoping doing this, I would meet people, make friends.  But even doing things, like going to events and regularly attending classes, just nothing.  I love talking to and meeting people, but I just never get placed in the right place at the right time.  And the moments I get close, I fuck up again, or something else happens.

I downloaded some dating apps just to try to meet people. I know I wouldn’t have much success, as a short medium attractive guy.  I would maybe get a match a week if I was lucky, and we’d send a couple messages, but nothing more.

Last week, I finally got someone’s contact info, and we set up plans to go on a date. I wasn’t particularly interested in this girl, but was just exited to finally go on a date. I had a class for the time we planned, but that didn’t matter. I can miss it. Things were finally going well.  And then last night, I suddenly remembered.  Nothing is ever supposed to go well. I always get so close.

So this morning, I check my phone. She had blocked me. I didn’t even feel anything. “It’s just how everything goes for me”, I thought.  I’m not angry at her or anything. She probably just decided last minute she didn’t want to go.

I’m tired. I’m done trying. I’m killing myself next week. Maybe if I keep putting myself out there I’ll actually meet someone. But it’s an endless cycle. My depression makes it so hard to do that, which just causes me to get more depressed. What is supposed to break this cycle. I’ve tried medication, no effect. Therapy? I’ve tried may therapists and they’ve all told me the same bull shit I’ve already heard. 

I don’t really want to die. It would be nice for things to work out for once.  But with the cycle I’m in, nothing will ever change, and I don’t see a way of breaking it. If things will just be like this forever, why bother continuing.

Sorry for this absolute wall of text. If you actually read this, cool I guess. I just needed to write all my thoughts out.

,depression,"Hey everyone,

So the title says it all. Been going through depression since i was around the age of 13, currently i am 26 and beginning to lose to my demons. This often pushes me to take things to the extreme. For example, if i want to achieve something, then i become obsessed with it and go ""all out"" so to say, otherwise i feel dead inside. People think of me as this ""strong"" individual, because i have never shown my weakness to anyone, even my family, so everyone is oblivious to my inner suffering. It's a pure living hell.

It's like having rabies, but instead of dying, it constantly attacks your brain and makes you think of irrational things day in and day out. I don't have anything to brag about in my normal life. Average job, no education after high school, no car, no girlfriend, no friends, no money to go on holidays - nothing. The only thing that i got going for myself is my gym addiction, built a decent physique over the years and planned to actually compete. Ironically, i had all of these things minus the money part when i was in high school.

Lost the ability to smile as well. I laugh at jokes, at funny things, but my heart is dead. I became unable to form relationships of any kind, whether they'd be romantic or friend related. Just recently lost my business too. I am in debt on top of that. How do you fight demons who always drag you back down to the bottom of a dark,empty ocean every time you start seeing light at the end of the tunnel ?

&lt;p&gt;So the title says it all. Been going through depression since i was around the age of 13, currently i am 26 and beginning to lose to my demons. This often pushes me to take things to the extreme. For example, if i want to achieve something, then i become obsessed with it and go &amp;quot;all out&amp;quot; so to say, otherwise i feel dead inside. People think of me as this &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; individual, because i have never shown my weakness to anyone, even my family, so everyone is oblivious to my inner suffering. It&amp;#39;s a pure living hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like having rabies, but instead of dying, it constantly attacks your brain and makes you think of irrational things day in and day out.

,depression,"The title sums up my whole life perfectly.

  
I was born to a loving, caring family. My father is my personal hero, a real masculine role model, who taught me pretty much everything I know. My mother gave me all the love a child can ask for. They were always supportive in all the good things that I used to do (but always very strict about the bad things).  
When I chose a career path, they paid for a private school (which I'm so grateful for, high school was the best time of my life), they supported me in sports (I used to be an amateur middleweight boxer). I love them both dearly.

That's why it hurts so much. Knowing that I'm nothing but a disappointment, a burden, a leech to them. I made the worst decision possible. After I finished high school, I got accepted into the best technical university in my country (it is so embarrassing to think back about it now, i actually thought it was an achievement.) to study (I'm ashamed to even type this, be free to laugh) software engineering.  


I can't explain how a person can do something so stupid. I only recently found out that most programmers and software engineers with a masters degree (Which only about 15% of students finish) make minimum wage, if they are lucky. (I'm from the Czech Republic, central Europe.) Programming is a dying career here, everything is getting outsourced to the East, jobs are disappearing left and right. Moving to a different country is not an option, since I don't know any foreign languages (except for English, which I'm really not good at, as you can see. And most positions require you to know the language of that nation anyway, if you want to work in Poland, you got to know Polish, etc.)  


It's soul crushing to think that all this hard work is worth nothing and even if I manage to finish my degree, I'm gonna be making the same salary as people with no education and skills whatsoever.  
The minimum wage here in Czechia is not enough to afford even a 1 room apartment, so I'm either gonna live in my parents basement for the rest of my life, or I'm gonna end up homeless, if they decide to kick me out, and probably freeze to death when it gets cold.  
But then again, I'm the only one to blame here. i should have been thinking more when choosing a career path. It's too late to change my profession now, firstly, because of all the money that my parents invested into it (I feel like crying writing that) and secondly, because I know deep down that I  can only do this, that I would be a complete failure trying anything else.

The moment reality of my situation hit me, my life took a bad turn. As you can imagine, having those thoughts every day just ravages your mental health. I can't sleep properly and there are sequences of days when I don't eat anything. I'm losing weight (i would be a lightweight boxer by now, but I stopped training anyway), my grades got worse. I get feelings of despair and misery every day. I don't smile anymore. I get no joy from anything. All my friends are gone. I'm very lonely.  


I'm invisible to women. And I completely lost interest in pursuing relationships (no woman is ever gonna date a homeless software engineer). I can't remember the last time I had morning wood. I'm never going to have children. My bloodline ends with me.

I am generally better the last 6 months. I have taken the past year off college to focus on taking care of myself. I went to therapy but had recently stopped so I could afford to go to school again this year.

,depression,"I'm a 26 year old man and I'm in the worst state of my life right now. I started out my adult life by dropping out of college after 2 weeks due to depression and severe anxiety and getting $10,000 in debt.

It took me 4 years to pay that and my car loan off and I was finally back to even financially. I spent thousands of dollars trying therapy, medications, chiropractor for my back issues and nothing helped me. I've tried exercise, healthy diet, yoga, everything I've ever been told to do to get better and it never helped me long term.

I've been working dead end jobs ever since and barely scraping by each month while my body and mind deteriorate. I have so many untreated and likely some undiagnosed health issues and I barely have the energy to do my laundry once a week anymore and can't do anything else productive. I am too anxious to leave my room and even be around my roommates I've known since high school.

I feel like I'm never going to escape the poverty loop. I finally broke even 4 years ago when I was 22 and now I'm back $5000 in credit card debt stressing me out every day. My car broke down and now have to Uber around town making my finances even worse. I failed at any goal I set in terms of trying to get a better career.

I can't live like this working 40 hours a week at a dead end job with nothing bringing me enjoyment except food. I have no family to help me. I haven't had more than 2 days off a week since I was in high school.

Why is the world punishing me because my parents ignored my health concerns growing up and they were too poor to help me afford college? It seems like everyone else who is as bad off as I am has their family to help support them through their finances and health issues whereas mine just exacerbated mine.

I just can't do it any more. I broke down crying at work last night. I can't even stand working a job where I sit at a desk 8 hours a night and talk to 3 people per shift. I want to end it all so bad but don't know a painless guaranteed way to do it.

I spent thousands of dollars trying therapy, medications, chiropractor for my back issues and nothing helped me. I&amp;#39;ve tried exercise, healthy diet, yoga, everything I&amp;#39;ve ever been told to do to get better and it never helped me long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working dead end jobs ever since and barely scraping by each month while my body and mind deteriorate. I have so many untreated and likely some undiagnosed health issues and I barely have the energy to do my laundry once a week anymore and can&amp;#39;t do anything else productive. I am too anxious to leave my room and even be around my roommates I&amp;#39;ve known since high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m never going to escape the poverty loop. I finally broke even 4 years ago when I was 22 and now I&amp;#39;m back $5000 in credit card debt stressing me out every day. My car broke down and now have to Uber around town making my finances even worse. I failed at any goal I set in terms of trying to get a better career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t live like this working 40 hours a week at a dead end job with nothing bringing me enjoyment except food. I have no family to help me. I haven&amp;#39;t had more than 2 days off a week since I was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the world punishing me because my parents ignored my health concerns growing up and they were too poor to help me afford college? It seems like everyone else who is as bad off as I am has their family to help support them through their finances and health issues whereas mine just exacerbated mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t do it any more. I broke down crying at work last night. I can&amp;#39;t even stand working a job where I sit at a desk 8 hours a night and talk to 3 people per shift. I want to end it all so bad but don&amp;#39;t know a painless guaranteed way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want help and my country and state don&amp;#39;t care about me and I have nobody else.&lt;/p&gt;

It's apparently designed for teens like me who have noone in their life that they could talk to. Now, for me, personally, my experience was subpar.

I don't want to disrespect the volunteer work there, but after the 2 successful attempts, one in the morning and one just 3 hours earlier, I felt like I was just a number on a waiting list. The system constantly kicked me out of the conversation, and the one time I actually had a decent conversation, it felt like they were trying to cast me aside as quick as possible. 

As soon as I mentioned that music helps me organize my thoughts at times, they told me to just listen to music and the conversation closed immediately after. Maybe I'm stupid, or maybe it's just my anxiety and paranoia, but they seemed annoyed. I guess it would help to say what I was expecting.

I was thinking it would be a deep dive into why I feel the way I do, but it was more just a short session of giving me a metaphorical ice pack and sending me home with an old, stale lollipop. If I didn't feel worthless enough already, then well...

As for the 2nd ""successful"" attempt, it was even shorter. They asked me how I was feeling, they asked a question to confirm what I said, I answered, and then the very next message was telling me that I must've stepped away and that the conversation had been closed.

The automated reply also hit me with a stinger saying ""you matter."" It doesn't feel like it. It doesn't help that I had to reply ""STOP"" over and over because I kept getting auto replies from the bot.

Needless to say, I have less faith that online school therapy will even put a dent in how I feel.

,depression,"I am 20 years old and genderfluid (they/she/he), and every day I am alive, I have no clue what is going on. My depression is mostly caused by my other disorders (ASD, ADHD, and OCD), and I've had it since junior high. Often, I feel so hopeless because those disorders all have their own comorbidities that mess with me on the day to day. I struggle with writing, spelling, understanding verbal words, social cues, my own emotions, if my thinking or the disorders, and more. There is just so much happening all the time at a nightmare level of complexity. It exhausts me and paints the world dull. I feel like I am always on the verge of imploding and exploding at the same time. People get mad at me for things I didn't know and expect so much from me, when right now this is all I got.

,depression,"I'll go back to the beginning. I started dating a girl I feel I really fell in love with. It lasted only 4 months, but I really felt something for her. There were a few times I asked to be intimate with her, with the last time her telling me she thought she was asexual. I was fine with that and was trying my best to adapt. She wasn't a touchy partner but my love language is touch. Whenever she asked to tone it down, I did everything I could to tone it down. Though, in hers and my whole friend group's eyes, I didn't try hard enough.

She broke up with me over text with a long paragraph, not in person because our friend group probably told her I was shaking from anxiety. That morning, I talked to a friend who wasn't in the friend group about what I knew was going to happen. The girlfriend got very upset with me about that but I felt like I couldn't talk to anybody about it without them telling the girlfriend about how scared I was. I admit, talking to someone else instead of her was wrong, but I felt like if I talked to the girlfriend about how scared I was of the break up, it was going to get worse.

She told me I made everyone uncomfortable, that I don't listen or have boundaries. After reading that long break up paragraph, I spiraled. I ran somewhere the group wouldn't find me and I completely broke down. It was so bad that I was taken to the hospital because of my thoughts of self harm and worse.

I lost that friend group, that girlfriend, a lot of people from that place. There's only one person in that friend group that still talks to me and I think she's annoyed with how much I dream about everyone.

No one in the group talks about me anymore. I was easy to get rid of and easy to forget. What sucks more is that this isn't the first time this happened in that group. I always knew that one wrong move and I was next. And then it actually happened.

&lt;p&gt;She told me I made everyone uncomfortable, that I don&amp;#39;t listen or have boundaries. After reading that long break up paragraph, I spiraled. I ran somewhere the group wouldn&amp;#39;t find me and I completely broke down. It was so bad that I was taken to the hospital because of my thoughts of self harm and worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost that friend group, that girlfriend, a lot of people from that place. There&amp;#39;s only one person in that friend group that still talks to me and I think she&amp;#39;s annoyed with how much I dream about everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one in the group talks about me anymore. I was easy to get rid of and easy to forget. What sucks more is that this isn&amp;#39;t the first time this happened in that group. I always knew that one wrong move and I was next. And then it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to keep track of time or my own memory. I haven&amp;#39;t been sleeping well (either too little or too much). I&amp;#39;ve been using pot a lot more than I had before and I&amp;#39;m exhausted all day every day. All I want is to die.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm 30 and I'm alone and it's tough to pretend I'm a whole person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't made a friend since high school. I'm starting to befriend someone at work but it's giving me a lot of anxiety because - when am I going to say The Thing that makes her hate me? It feels like I have to do everything right to be social, or maybe I'm missing something that everyone else has, or maybe I'm just not cut out to be social. But to have friends you have to answer them -when they fucking text- regardless of what's going on in my life, and I just don't have the energy to keep up with that. I recently had someone tell me I was probably not doing well on Bumble BFF because I'm a slow responder. Sometimes I don't know what to say, sometimes words aren't happening in my brain, sometimes I'm just too tired. Maybe missing out on social things for all of my 20's is something I'm never going to be able to recover from. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a lot of workplaces where I was ""the loser."" I had no friends, I'd catch people saying mean things about me, they all get together with each other and I'm not invited. I've been in multiple situations where groups of people don't like me and do shitty, passive-aggressive things to me every chance they get. I don't know what I do wrong. I try to just be a genuine, kind person. I get feedback that I'm nice, I know I'm not perfect but at least I've had some feedback that I'm not totally delusional to think I'm a nice person. But there have also been a few times where I know what I said. There have been a few times when I can pinpoint the off comment that makes someone turn on me, and it must be more than one off comment because it's always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me. It's terrifying to feel like at any moment, I can slip up and someone will just decide I'm not worth their time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I never feel like I say the right thing. Some of my coworker's responses are lackluster (think ""lol"") and I just wonder if she even wants to talk to me? Making friends gives me the same anxiety that trying to date someone gives me. That's kind of fucked up, I should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend. But also it affects me. I feel like I'm not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided I'm not worth their time. And honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment I realize I've internalized all that rejection and got to where I don't feel good enough for friendship. Why would someone pick me when I'm a ball of nerves? Why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feels like half a person? 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've been doing okay relative to the last 10 years. I finally got a job that doesn't feel like Chinese water torture. I'm on medication and that helps a ton. I'm a lot better about not letting myself slip into negative thought patterns. This week I haven't been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because I finally got medication that isn't expired and I'm taking it regularly. But every time I think about social stuff, it just gives me this.... squished feeling? I can't name the feeling but it's visceral, my body feels shitty. I'm going on a vacation with my mom and her work friends in a month and I'm so fucking nervous because what if I do The Thing that makes everyone hate me? I don't even know what the fucking thing is!! But spending four days with people who are talking crap about you in a small space.... I did that around this time last year and it was so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a solution-oriented person and part of my problem is that I don't know how to fix this part of my life. I don't really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship. It took me eight years to figure out the solution to hating myself, and honestly even though it's a struggle it's also worth it to fight through those feelings and find an even timbre. Social situations are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective. I've googled ""How to feel less lonely"" and the fucking answer was Make Friends. How do you make friends when you feel like nobody wants to be your friend (And for good reason!)? Therapists have basically told me to find a group and the friendships will happen naturally, but there's not a huge meet up scene in my area and I have a ton of anxiety about going to one, and the few I have been to were not great. I couldn't read the book on ""How to Influence People and Never Feel Powerless Again,"" I got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss-ass bullshit, but this time I'm not even getting paid for it. That book makes me feel like I have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know. I'm going to keep trying different things. I'm going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing things the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome.

I did that around this time last year and it was so bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a solution-oriented person and part of my problem is that I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix this part of my life. I don&amp;#39;t really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship. It took me eight years to figure out the solution to hating myself, and honestly even though it&amp;#39;s a struggle it&amp;#39;s also worth it to fight through those feelings and find an even timbre. Social situations are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective. I&amp;#39;ve googled &amp;quot;How to feel less lonely&amp;quot; and the fucking answer was Make Friends. How do you make friends when you feel like nobody wants to be your friend (And for good reason!)? Therapists have basically told me to find a group and the friendships will happen naturally, but there&amp;#39;s not a huge meet up scene in my area and I have a ton of anxiety about going to one, and the few I have been to were not great. I couldn&amp;#39;t read the book on &amp;quot;How to Influence People and Never Feel Powerless Again,&amp;quot; I got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss-ass bullshit, but this time I&amp;#39;m not even getting paid for it. That book makes me feel like I have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m going to keep trying different things. I&amp;#39;m going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing things the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed this rant today and if anyone actually manages to read all that, thanks for your time and I hope both our days get better.&lt;/p&gt;

On the weekend I tried to hurt myself and went to the emergency room on Monday. They prescribed me some Lexapro and I went home, relieved that I finally got some help. 

Half an hour after I returned home 6 cops stormed my apartment saying they received a hint from the school that I was gonna hurt myself and they searched my whole apartment for a gun (which I don't have so they obv didn't find one) and restrained me. They then took me to the same hospital I was at just half an hour ago and I spoke to the psychiatrist there again, who told the police I am not a threat to myself or someone else. So they let me go again. 

During that they took my phone and it ran out of battery and I didn't have access to it for like 3 hours or more. During that time two of my classmates messaged me asking why I blocked them and they attacked me, not knowing my phone ran out of battery and that's why I didn't answer. They then blocked me and I explained to them on Instagram what happened and they read it but didn't care apparently. 

My classmates apparently told our headmaster they were ""worried"" and then he called the police. I am getting the proper help from all of my teachers and my headmaster and I have an appointment with our schools psychiatrist soon. 

It's just that this whole police incident has left me panicking and crying when I see a police officer/car and everytime someone with heavy boots walks on my apartment floor I sit up thinking the police will come back again. I also can't sleep properly and can't distract myself because I keep having horrible flashbacks of the scene when the police stormed in which leaves me breaking down.

It left me broken, traumatized, overwhelmed and desperate because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that my classmates all blocked me, are ignoring me and not even looking at me. Talking about being &amp;quot;worried&amp;quot; and not even one person asked me if I was alright or how I was doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am considering going back to the emergency room and talking to the same psychiatrist from before but it&amp;#39;s not really an emergency you know? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this text is long, I am just overwhelmed and don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. All I know is I am traumatized as fuck and broken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do? Someone please assure me that everything is gonna be okay because at this point all my hope has left me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Im talking about the kind of depressive episode where you lay in bed all day for days/weeks and struggle to find energy/motivation for simple functioning such as eating and showering. Just lay/sit there having negative thoughts and feeling hopeless, useless and pathetic.
I have these episodes a few or so times a year.

My question is: Do you generally have something in your mind that feels like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode? 

For example sometimes for me i just feel like *if only I could completely clean my house*... I'd start to feel better. 
Other times it might be something else on my to do list or a few things i feel are the obstacles to feeling better..  

the obstacles always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state as if I'd have to put on a ton of body weights and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued. 

Its bizarre because ive noticed over the years that completing whatever it is that I've decided as my *obstacle* is generally the 1st step to leaving my major depressive episode...I can't describe the mental workout it is to get something done sometimes though..like I may attempt to get it done 4 times in a week to just end up giving up and going back to bed.

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets this? And sets up *hurdle type things for themselves* when they are super depressive ???

Just lay/sit there having negative thoughts and feeling hopeless, useless and pathetic.
I have these episodes a few or so times a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: Do you generally have something in your mind that feels like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example sometimes for me i just feel like &lt;em&gt;if only I could completely clean my house&lt;/em&gt;... I&amp;#39;d start to feel better. 
Other times it might be something else on my to do list or a few things i feel are the obstacles to feeling better..  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the obstacles always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state as if I&amp;#39;d have to put on a ton of body weights and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"this is my first reddit post. also my first time sharing this information with anyone but i can't really keep it in anymore man so bear with me. hopefully there's a psychiatrist out there that will read this and hit me with some world-altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell i will ever tell anyone, especially not a doctor or psychiatrist, what you are about to read but i really just need to get this out there

-------------------------------------------
first and foremost, no im not going to kill myself. let's get that out of the way. but i do think im depressed. i was telling myself it was just a life-slump for a long time. then i was telling myself it was just sadness from the slump. now i've literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i gotta talk about it with someone, even if someone is this phone screen.

-it is common for me to have suicidal thoughts. i really don't know why since, in reality, i wouldn't want to kill myself. i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm. i am self aware of these thoughts and i have attempted breathing and thought altering methods to get rid of them, but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger. it physically hurts. they are not always about suicide, but they are always very negative targeted at myself. i just can't help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nuts to finally end it all. sometimes i can't look at myself in the mirror because i know it'll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me. and as sad as it is to say it i really just do not like myself. i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am. objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy. im 6'2 and im physically fit. but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different. there have been a few instances in recent months of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can't. i literally can't. i don't see it, i don't know where you guys are looking, but i truly don't see what you see.

okay it's not just about my appearance. i find myself annoying and awkward. i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time, usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes. but behind my smile is most commonly a frown. im fucking annoying. my thoughts scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect. i talk too much. sometimes i say things i dont even mean or agree with just to say something. i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot. im volatile and irritable and ugh
  
-i fuck up most things i do, work, school, relationships, you know how it goes, the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal. something about the way i was made is just wrong i guess. that's another one of those negative thoughts that repeats in my head a lot. born wrong. today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself, beating my own face in, felt great honestly wish i could've made it a reality 

-i can't find happiness in any of the things i used to enjoy. ive gradually stopped all my hobbies except for the gym, which is where i take my anger out usually(i have a lot of that). i can't even sit through a movie without thinking ""what is the point of me doing this."" WHAT IS THE POINT?! life feels numb. pointless. i go about my societal life just like everybody else. i study, work, play, sleep(rarely) but it all feels the same. a gray bland mesh of nothing. even something like eating delicious food i just don't get enjoyment anymore. the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone makes a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh, but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh. 

-honest opinion of myself? i fucking suck. im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck. i constantly make poor decisions and can't seem to learn from previous ones. im ugly. the only things im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself. i say dumb shit and get shit on for it. what kind of asshole has the privilege and opportunities that i have and is still sad and lazy like this? im the type of person that was actually just wired wrong in the head, and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can't disgusts me. to be honest i don't even know who i am. a few months ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is. i replied ""nothing. i don't have one."" i really don't have a talent or something im good at, and seeing people around me do amazing things and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurts. 

*** i do not feel like this 24/7. id say about 10% of the time i forget about all my stresses and worries and appearances and fuck ups and im actually HAPPY. then when the happy goes away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all comes flooding back. im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless highs and happinesses that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them.

-the question i find myself asking often is why. why am i doing this. why do i feel this way. why did i say that. why did i do that. why am i a certain way yadda yadda. i am a realist. i also truly believe there is no point to this. life. why do we all live such stressful unrewarding lives, putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever? i read comments on posts like these saying that life is beautiful, meet everyone you can, experience nature, get help, it gets better it CAN get better, but the thing is, no, it can't. everyone's situation is different i guess, but where im at and what im doing, nothings gonna change. im not going anywhere. even if i was it wouldn't matter. societal standings and fancy job positions mean nothing. humans are not made equal. everyone is different, special, in their own way. therefore, some people are biologically and factually better than others. whether it's stronger, larger, smarter, faster, people are different and some traits are preferable. i just happened to get stuck with the traits that make me FUCKING SUCK at life. no amount of meditation or antidepressants (fuck big pharm) is going to change who i am. people don't change. painting a leopard red doesn't remove his spots, it just hides them temporarily

,depression,"You know that feeling when the days and nights drag on? The tears stream down your cheeks, your vision starts to tunnel. The feeling of being lost with no where to go. The movie staring yourself is playing and all you can do is sit back and watch as the world starts to slip away from you slowly. 

The first time I tried taking my life was 8 years old. I was physically and mentally abused from the moment I was born, and still mentally abused to this day. This time its me abusing myself. I got so used to being alone and not wanted, so what's the point in trying anymore. 

2020 was a bad year for everyone but that is the time where I started losing a grip on my life for the last time. My world started spirlling out of control. What did I do? I woke up at 330am walked into the kitchen grabbed a knife and drug of deep across my throat. I walked into the bedroom where my wife was sleeping. She woke up to the sound of gargling, only you find me trying to hold my throat shut. She immediately called 911 and just looked at me in aw. With a single tear falling down my cheek. All she could do is watch as her husband is slowly dying right in front of her. When I woke up 3 days later in the hospital,. She was no where to be found... This is when my world came crashing down over me, hearing those 4 words whisper out of her mouth "" I want a divorce"". That was the day I died inside. I lost my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, and the mother of my child. 

I lost everything that day, family, friends, my daughter, my house, my truck, and my heart. Every day I fall asleep crying. Begging to take me back in time, but in reality I know I can't. So what is there left to do you ask? Die... 

Life for me has ended, I have nothing more left in me anymore. I have been suffering from depression for a very long time. I'm exhausted, I'm tired, I'm alone, I'm lost. All I want is to end this story of my life called misery. I want to leave this world so I don't have to disappoint anyone ever again. I am broken, I can't do it anymore. Everyone says life is precious. Well to me life is a waste of time. 

I have nothing more to give, I have nothing more to learn, I have nothing. 

I am depressed, I am hurt, I am sitting in the theater watching as my screen starts to fade to black. This is it I tell myself. I am no longer going to sit here and put a fake smile on my face for everyone else. I am done helping out others with there problem. 

Why doesn't anyone ask me how I am doing, probably because I would lie. I am going to die. I am ready. I hope and pray the my daughter and my ex wife can forgive me. I will always love them until the end of time. 

With that being said, I am signing off... I have nothing left in the tank. 

Goodbye cruel cruel world, until we meet again. Daddy will always be looking over you guiding you in a direction I never was pushed towards... 
I may not have any friends, but I will be leaving a mark on legacy. My job here is done.

,depression,"I am 21 years old, junior in college. I have multiple problems that I need to address. To start, I have gotten carried away with smoking weed. I have been using it almost everyday since I was 18 and I can no longer control it. Im always buying it when I can't always afford it, I spend a good amount of my time at home smoking weed or using THC products. I have also been drinking a lot more than I used to, and I have even picked up a nicotine habit from my friends. I am not doing as well in school as I should be and I really need to be more proactive and motivated, but I feel no motivation some days to even do anything school related. I havent been eating well a lot of days, been eating a lot of fast food and skipping meals some days. 

There are nights where I barely get enough sleep because I end up staying up most of the night being on my phone, watching TV, or playing video games. I have set goals for myself that I want to workout more, build myself up, and eat better but I never stick to them. I feel very anxious and depressed a lot of the time, with the only relief I have felt comes from hanging out and talking with friends. I have some really great friends that I am very close with and a wonderful family that would do anything for me but I can't help but feel alone.  

I feel a great need for companionship and I have been trying to get into a relationship for a long time, going from one person to the next but nothing ever becoming of it and we become strangers again. It has taken away a lot of my energy and exhausted my motivation and drives me further into my loneliness and adds to my anxiety. I have been on an emotional rollercoaster the past several months talking and going out with multiple girls (not at the same time) and it ending the same. I just feel a void in my life some days and lately I have been spending a lot of time around friends to try and fill that void, more than I usually do which could also contribute to me spending less time on school and a lot of other important things. I have barely been home in the past week because I was with friends.

 I feel completely empty and hopeless somedays and feel like my life is over. I see others living their best life, exciting things happening, having opportunities, connection with others is just natural to them, and just having a great time with life and then there's me who wishes I could be that way but I know I am different than them and no one will ever see me like that. I will always be by myself wherever I go, and I used to be such a happy child, excited for life, not afraid to dream big and wonder about the future, and just live in the moment but things happened that turned me into what I am today. I feel like a shell of who I could have been and that my younger self would be dissapointed in me. I wish I could go back to when I was about 5 and not taken it for granted and go through life again with what i know now. 

Some days I really do not like the person I am turning into. I do not thing that I am doing what's best for myself mentally, physically, and emotionally. I feel like I'm on a treadmill, walking through life but not actually getting anywhere while watching everyone else pass me by.

,depression,"No clue where to put this so it’s going here. 

A while back I was asked “what caused you to start drinking so heavily?” My default respond to that has always been “it’s just how I am”. Which for the most part is correct, deep down I think I always knew the real answer. Now I am finally realizing it’s truth, it’s love. 

A little more context: I have been sober for over 8 years now, and to be honest, recently it has really been tested and I’ve come closer than I ever have to relapsing. It is worth mentioning, I’m not the type of person to actively seek a romantic relationship. I have had a few very brief flings over the years, but nothing I would consider serious, and for the most part I have been okay with it. But now, I have actually caught real feelings for someone, and I am falling hard. So hard it’s really scaring me, it’s causing me to want to hide from the feelings as I used too by drinking. 

After years of counseling I was given better “tools” to help process certain feelings that could lead to me drinking. Which I do believe they have helped me recently because I actually did something I didn’t think I was capable of. I told her how I felt. Too my surprise she actually didn’t tell me no, but, she didn’t exactly say yes either. Which is why I am feeling the way I am now I believe. 

Now I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster of highs and lows. I see her and talk to her daily as we do work together, however some days she seems so distant and shut off, others it seems to me she’s overly flirty. We have gone out once, it didn’t really go as planned but it was still nice. 

Now to the stuff that is really eating at me. She had just gotten out of a relationship a while back. I know it didn’t end well and when I told her how I felt she said she still was trying to get over her ex and she was confused. Which is understandable, and I want to give her time and space but at the same time I don’t want to miss my chance, especially because I have not felt this way about anyone for over 10 years.  To make things worse her ex is also a coworker in our department and I have seen them leaving together after work multiple times a week. Which to be fair is really her business, but if she really would rather be with him, why don’t she tell me. That’s what’s killing me, I feel like she is using me as a fallback or a second choice. I really hope it’s not the case, I do not think I could handle it. I just wish I knew for sure how she felt, I can handle being rejected it the limbo I feel like I’m in I can’t handle. And honestly I don’t know what to do about it. I’m so scared I’m going to slip one day and have a drink, if that happens I know I won’t recover from it and I’ll loose everything I worked so hard to achieve.

But now, I have actually caught real feelings for someone, and I am falling hard. So hard it’s really scaring me, it’s causing me to want to hide from the feelings as I used too by drinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of counseling I was given better “tools” to help process certain feelings that could lead to me drinking. Which I do believe they have helped me recently because I actually did something I didn’t think I was capable of. I told her how I felt. Too my surprise she actually didn’t tell me no, but, she didn’t exactly say yes either. Which is why I am feeling the way I am now I believe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster of highs and lows. I see her and talk to her daily as we do work together, however some days she seems so distant and shut off, others it seems to me she’s overly flirty. We have gone out once, it didn’t really go as planned but it was still nice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the stuff that is really eating at me. She had just gotten out of a relationship a while back. I know it didn’t end well and when I told her how I felt she said she still was trying to get over her ex and she was confused. Which is understandable, and I want to give her time and space but at the same time I don’t want to miss my chance, especially because I have not felt this way about anyone for over 10 years.  To make things worse her ex is also a coworker in our department and I have seen them leaving together after work multiple times a week. Which to be fair is really her business, but if she really would rather be with him, why don’t she tell me. That’s what’s killing me, I feel like she is using me as a fallback or a second choice. I really hope it’s not the case, I do not think I could handle it. I just wish I knew for sure how she felt, I can handle being rejected it the limbo I feel like I’m in I can’t handle. And honestly I don’t know what to do about it. I’m so scared I’m going to slip one day and have a drink, if that happens I know I won’t recover from it and I’ll loose everything I worked so hard to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more details if anyone has any questions. If anyone can tell me what I should do please feel free, anything is better than how I feel now.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I recently was put up for a promotion at work to a position that would allow me to work less hours,less days and make more money while also furthering my future. I have never been happier

Until recently

I'm in the final stages of the process to get hired but I'm still CURRENTLY in my previous position. We have a rule at work, you can be late once per 30 Days, if you go over that you get written up and put on a ""disciplinary level"". Which wouldnt be so terrible if one of the stipulations of being put on a disciplinary level is being unable to transfer positions for a year.

So on sunday morning I wake up and start making breakfast, what i do every morning on my day off, I've been off every other weekend for the past 6 years so I go into autopilot and sit at the table, look at the clock and think ""I'd be at work right now"" so 8am rolls past and while I'm wating I see my phone buzz so I pick it up and look at the screen and see the words that make my heart climb into my throat every time

""Boss: Where are you?? You were scheduled for 8"" 

I scramble upstairs so fast I knocked over the table and chairs and took some picture frames off the walls of the stairs,  but I get to work and think ""it's fine its okay I just cant be late for 30 days,easy enough"" 

3 days later it's an unbelievably slow day, so we all order sushi and I drew the short straw to pick it up. Takes me 25 minutes to get there, pick up the food and start heading back, so I'm at a stop light about 5 minutes from my job when I see a car blast through the light and TBone a truck causing a huge accident and blocking my path back to my job, 

I feel my heart sink and my ears ring, the closest way back is an extra 10 minutes at least, this asshole running a red light may cost me my job,

I'm not proud of it but I sped the entire way there to get back to the hospital, I sprint out of my car(leaving the food) I get inside and dive to the time clock and swipe my card

""Time punched 17:05 LATE"" 

At this point I just stand there for a second, unsure of what to do, do I tell my boss? Do i try to fix it? Do I lie? 
I finally decide to text my boss and explain the whole scenario in detail, expecting to get back a next step, a scolding, reassurance or anything. Instead I get back one word

Ok??? What does that even mean??? I want to press it further but I'm so scared of fucking up even more, I've taken on extra responsibilities this week and picked up 26 hours of overtime over the next 2 weeks as a subtle way of saying ""please dear god dont put me on a level I need this promotion""

,depression,"Hi there

I've spent the past couple of months dealing w anxiety, depression and depersonalization, and trying/changing medications. I am on a part time work plan where I work remotely in the afternoons. 

Even though I go to bed at a very decent hour, I find it so difficult to get up in the morning. I will make plans to get up before 9 and get things accomplished, make an appointment, etc, and despite all this, I just turn my alarm off and sleep until noon, when I have to log on for work. I just dont want to be awake.

I need to get back to work soon and will be getting up at my old time of 630 am every day, but I have no idea how ill do it. Things like that used to be so normal before but now I barely want to be awake or leave the house.

,depression,"I'm on mobile so please excuse me, I'm also a first-time poster on here.  28 female.

I quit a job I had for 5 years, last year in May of 2021. I was really good at that job, one of the top people even if it was just a warehouse job, I was a trainer I knew how to do everything and a lot was expected of me everyday. My boss was incredibly verbally abusive to everyone, I didn't realize it for a few years but my last two years being there she was talking bad about everybody behind their back and just being a horrible human. I finally quit one day when I got a different job with an old coworker. I was working that job for about 2 months before I started to struggle going. At first it was because I felt inadequate and tired all the time, I have a problem with being new at things. It progressed to a new coworker there was starting to push my boundaries a little bit, older man telling me what to do and making me feel dumb, which I know is my own issue. I realize this whole post is my own issue.. but anyway.

  I ended up leaving that job because every time I was there I was going to the bathroom to cry at least once and I couldn't make myself do it anymore and between that place and the job I'm at now I had three other jobs, one was Amazon delivery, the other was a daycare, and the one before that was just instacart. I couldn't make enough money on instacart to even be a part-time job, it was also putting stress on my car. But I loved being able to work for myself basically and create my own hours. I hated how the kids at daycare were treated and it disgusted me to the point I couldn't work there anymore, and Amazon hours were terrible, and I wasn't getting home until 9:00 p.m. which does not work for my 8-year-old son. 
I finally got this job in January of this year and so far it has been pretty good but I've noticed that I'm struggling to go a full 40 hour pay period, in the past 3 months I've missed seven days which is a lot I suppose. I just wake up in the morning and struggle to go and a voice in my head tells me that I don't need to and everything will be okay even if I decide not to go. As long as the excuse I have is good enough. And then I get so anxious about going back that I decide to stay home the next day and the day after that.
 I'm currently on my third day of being at home and even though I have a good excuse I'm sure they don't believe me a little bit. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been a hard worker and up until my breaking point last year, I didn't know what this was. I still don't know what it is that I'm feeling. I'm not feeling entitlement or anything like that, I just feel empty and numb and what's the point of going? I have to have a verbal argument with myself, let me say that again, with myself. I literally have to talk out loud to myself and argue that I have a house payment, I have bills, I have a kid, who also has bills. What is wrong with me? My family on both sides has history of depression and I have unprofessionally diagnosed adhd, my mom has anxiety disorders.
 Last year when I quit my job I left because of the work environment and how bad it was, and now my new job it's more laid back but it's the same kind of job, nd I'm constantly worried I'm being talked about and that I'm not good enough to be there. My anxiety from the other job is transferring here. For no reason. Everyone is incredibly nice. 
I'm also struggling internally because I really want to go to college and get a better kind of job but I don't know what I want to do yet. I'm feeling overwhelmed by it because I'm a single mom and I don't know how I'm going to be able to go to school and work at the same time. So I guess for the past couple months I've also felt pretty trapped. Feeling like I'll never work for myself and I'll never get a good job because I can't figure my life out.

But has anyone experienced this kind of feeling at my age? I don't know if it's burnout or if it's related to my cptsd that I have from a physically abusive relationship from years ago. I've tried looking it up on Google, I've tried listening to meditational motivation stuff, and anyone give me help? In the form of advice. I don't want to be like this forever. I know it's understandable to not want to work, but I should be at work literally right now and instead I'm in bed speak texting this because I know something's wrong with me. I can't afford to do anything therapy right now so just any insight or stories from when you were my age and you broke a little bit? I'm just scared and tired and I want to kick myself in the ass but I don't know how and I don't have the energy too. I really don't need to hear anything negative about me, because I can tell you I'm already thinking it. I just feel like a waste of space who can't get her s*** together.

I just need to vent somewhere but I am also asking for help, but most importantly, I need someone to listen to me right now. I have no idea on what to do. 

I am a 16 year old student who goes to an art school, staying in a boarding school under the week. I have good parents and I love them and they love me, but have little understanding that depression is actually an illness. Due to my depression, I am very limited in talking about my feelings, since its exhausting and I do not know how to express myself. So when I'm usually confronted my them I say: ""I dont know"" ans they've grown tired of it. 
I have been feeling more depressed but also suicidal, starting to plan my suicide. I wanted to take my life in late april, probably by hanging myself. I dont exaclty want to die, but I just couldnt see any way of me feeling better. But I want to feel better. I dont want to take my own life, I have a lot ahead of me. 
A dear friend of mine and I talked to one of the workers in my boarding school and I told them everything, since I was afraid of taking my own life. But I didnt talk to my parents since on my side, its very difficult. 
To explain this, my mum is one of the few people that got damaged by the covid vaccine. The doctors didnt take her serious and she suffered so much the past few months, breaking down and falling down the stairs one time. My dad is a very busy man and I feel like he is just...I dont know how to explain, but emotionally not there often. I know this is just my point of view and does not reflect reality, but I basically feel like this towards my parents. 
The worker in my boarding school made up 3 options: 1. Stay in boarding school and looking for a therapist tomorrow 2. Calling my parents to take me home and 3. To go to the mental hospital immediately. 
I just didnt know what to do. So the worker had to call my parents. They chose to take me home. 
Even tho the worker said that my father sounded on the phone like he was understanding, the reality looked different. My parents where of course overwhelmed and angry, I tried my best explaining everything. For example, my mother said i didnt even try to get a new therapist, but I did my best. 
When we got home, it got worse. 
My father asked stuff like how I wanted to take my own life, I didnt want to tell him. Later, my mum came downstairs and we all talked. Well, not really. 
They were overwhelmed and seemed angry, tho they said they werent. My parents screamed at me saying I didnt try to reach out to them, questioning why I didnt talk to them. But they said that they cant tell me reality or else I'd start panicking an crying, they told me that I cant accept the truth and I'm panicking because of this, that I'm acting up cause I was crying like a madman. I felt like my world was shattering. They screamed at me, that I wasnt trying my best and that I didnt even try. 
I tried to explain to them that I was scared to tell them and stuff. I tried my best, but I dont think they really understood. They want me to go a mental hospital but I know this would make things worse for me. I neez my friends in boarding school, but I know that this cant keep going on. I know that school itself makes me feel bad, but I have all my friends there that help me so much. 
But they said that it's too late for me and I should have made the decision earlier. 
I'm just totally...I dont know. 
I cant stop crying. I was speechless to how they screamed at me, breaking down in front of them. And I dont know what to do or how I should handle the situation. 
We wanted to go to my old therapist (who isnt really good) but we cant reach him. I don't know what to do. I am home right now, but I wanna go back to my friends. I really need them right now. But if course i cant. 
My mum is still saying how she cant keep up with me and shes overwhelmed with me.

,depression,"First off I have very little experience in dealing with anyone with Depression I freely admit that.

Over the past couple of months I have been Chatting with and Hanging out with this amazing woman I met on a Dating app.

She has Severe Anxiety, PPD (Postnatal Depression), Suicidal Thoughts etc 

We'd hit things off pretty well just from chatting over the app from what I thought. There were a couple of times where she'd wanted to end her life so she tells me but she managed to get past that.

The first time I met her in Person was amazing I had never ever felt so at ease taking with a woman before it went really well. At that point I knew this chick was worth the time we just clicked that well instantly. 

Since then we've done a couple of day trips places and that went very well, also one of those times was with her young child. (less then 1yo) she doesn't have a lot of time for herself and finds it hard to get a decent nights sleep partly to do with the young one waking in the middle of the night. 

Lately she's had a couple of  very low moments, her home life isn't the best. (Still living at home because finically she cannot afford to leave) she gets Abuse from her mother constantly and also seems to live in fear especially when her child is being loud it could wake her Mother.

As of last week she admitted that she really liked me I have been clear all along that I really like her! just so she's not thinking that she's in limbo.

I live over an hour away from her but I do travel up to her home town for work at least twice a week sometimes less sometimes more. 

There's some weird thing where she doesn't want her mum knowing about me. So consequently I cant see her that much unless mum is not home which really sucks. 

I find it hard to deal with when it feels like she's giving me the cold shoulder. I know it's the depression that's doing it not her true feelings. One of her Red Flags about dating me is that I don't know/understand her mental health. However the way I see it is if you don't tell me then I can't understand but apparently that was not the way to approach that one...

I'd love for nothing more then to give her a big hug that in the hopes that it might make her feel a little better about things but unfortunately I don't get the opportunity. She knows that I will come up any time I don't mind driving at all so I don't let that be a barrier plus I can afford to do so.

I'm scared to loose her because I really want her and I to work. 

At times I want to just say stuff it and walk away but I know that's not what I want.

I have tried mindfulness, regular exercise, breathing techniques. Everything you can think of.

,depression,"This is a really long rant, but I just needed to get it out. I feel like I'm starting to become a better version of myself, one that people like/respect and want to be around. And I just can't stop beating myself up for not being this version in college. When I was nearly suicidal and I lost some friends who kept abandoning me and affirming the horrible thoughts I was already having.

Last year, one of my roommates lowkey bullied me and I started to believe I was a terrible person and was overthinking everything I ever said wrong, especially when a couple other friends abandoned me at the same time over something they were upset I said (which I think could have been resolved with communication but they didn't try). But I talked to my other former roommate recently and she said that I was fine, that I didn't deserve any of it and she didn't know what I was going through at the time. As she said, ""don't just turn the page, close the fucking book."" And I started to feel like I was getting closure about stuff.

So I thought I would text one of the other people who sort of ""broke up"" with me. It's been a year, I just apologized for how shit went down in the friend group without blaming her or anyone else and really poured my heart out about how dark my mental health was at the time. And I said she could apologize to the other girls (who I believe blocked me) if she wanted. I know it was a little selfish to unload like that, but I made sure to say that I didn't expect anything of her and she didn't need to respond. And she didn't reply. But she did like my instagram post today.

I know they don't owe me anything and I swear I'm not mad, but I think part of me was still holding on hope to some form of closure. Part of me hoped that they still cared, that maybe they would care a little if they knew how dark it was for me at the time. I know that's selfish, but damn the last few times we hung out were just me doing her favors and giving her rides before she ""broke up"" with me as a friend, so to speak. But no one cared. As soon as I wasn't a ""fun friend"", they bounced at the first sign of conflict/mental illness. 

And again, I'm not mad, I'm not gonna harass anyone with texts/expectations.

,depression,"Title says it all really.

Bit of context: I've been depressed for the better part of 3 years. It started late into high school. I've been referred to multiple mental health services, none of which have helped. I was first referred to CAHMS when I was 16-17. I stopped going to these sessions due to me not being able to open up.

I was then referred to SAMH about a year later. This was also no help.

Finally, I was referred to the Community Mental Health Team Lanarkshire. These sessions were in person where I spoke to a ""qualified"" mental health nurse. I honestly have no fucking clue how this guy got his job. He was totally unprofessional, had this patronising attitude the entire time, was rude and condescending at points and even laughed at me when I said I felt mediocre. The one silver lining here was that he had the ability to refer me onto a psychotherapist, which he said that I was on a 6 month waiting list for. I didn't continue going to these sessions, however I assumed I'd still be on the waiting list. I remember my final session with him, I told him I was suicidal again.

Cut to about 3 months later, I phone them back up to check the progress on the waiting list and when I'd be seeing a psychotherapist. I was told by a receptionist that I'm not on any waiting list. This was very distressing to me because it felt like I had been waiting all this time for nothing. It turns out that they discharged me because I didn't continue going to the sessions.

I'm at my wits end here. I keep trying to get help but the NHS is just straight up incompetent. I wrote a letter to my GP explaining the situation and I got a phone call basically telling me there's nothing they can do and that I have to phone the Community Mental Health Team to see if I can get back on the waiting list.

,depression,"It’s so strange waking up everyday with this sense that you want things to “go back to the way they were.” Like your brain has its own lil Trumpster lying to you telling you your childhood was better before, or you were happy before you started this job, etc.. 

The truth is it’s always sucked though lol. There are brief moments now where you feel like things are okay, but it’s more of a lack of feeling. 

I’ve always thought I was broken because this has been my constant state since I was so small. I thought I’d grow out of it… or I wouldn’t, but life only continues to throw “curveballs.” 

To others, I seem high functioning, though kind of emotional. 

But I can’t get myself to focus on anything. I can’t wake up on time for work. I work in insurance sales, so I hate what I do. I have to pretend to care about people and their problems, but it just hurts so bad all of the time.

I know my boyfriend doesn’t understand. He’s in medical school and has his own struggles, but I know he feels love. He tells me he does. I don’t, and even if I do see briefly in his eyes that he does care for me, I quickly forget. 

Depression has made me into a terrible person. I should be so lucky to have someone who loves me so much, to have “my looks,” my wit, and the opportunities I’ve been afforded; but I can’t help but feel so completely destitute.

My whole school life has been extremely terrible, and i used to get bullied very badly back in kindergarten, and some of middle school. Im in highschool now and i have like no friends. Only 1 acquaintance. I dont go to the nice places that 'normal' people go to. for example:

1. Never went to a waterpark
2. Never had a night out or went to the mall with friends or classmates
3. Never went to disneyland when i was a kid
4. Never went on a mall shopping spree
5. I've only ever been too the mall twice in my whole life. And I didn't even see all of the mall
6. Never went to dave and busters
7. Never went to an aquarium
8. Never had a female friend
9. Never even had a casual conversation with a girl
10. No gifts for christmas
11. No gifts for my birthday
12. No friends, no one to talk to.

And a million more things that are normal for childhood, I didn't experience that. My childhood, i dont even want to start on that. I used to live in poverty in a 1 room tiny house with a cracked wall, and insects because my dad left us. My dad left the house when i was some months old, and he took the car and drove sluts in it. Regardless i wanted to speak to him. I still visited him and forgave him. But then he asked if i wanted to live with him in a bigger, nicer country with more opportunities. I said yes.  I experienced true mental torment in that house and the worst part is, i didnt even know, i thought my parents were the victims because they brainwashed me so much about some things that i still sometimes struggle if i should believe them or not. In that house i was brainwashed to the point where i couldnt even think for myself, i couldnt tell what was true, i couldnt think anything for myself. I experienced some not good things. They said i can visit my mom in her country, and they pick me up in 4 days to go back to the airport. Waited 4 days. Waited a whole week. They never came. They left me and abandoned me and just left me in some other country, and fyi, that country is one of the poorest ones in my area. The house im at now with my mom, my sister, grandma and 2 uncles isnt perfect. In fact, sometimes i feel like im losing my mind there. They're pretty creepy sometimes...(except for one of my uncles in the house). They dont have any malicious intent or anything, but i just dont want to get into it right now. Im a few pounds overweight and almost got an eating disorder. Its not even my fault that im fat. My mom said its because i took a medicine when i was little and it had a side effect of weight gain. I literally eat 10x less than a normal person. I dont even eat breakfast like 99% of the time on school days. I used to get bullied shitless for my weight. No social life, no friends. Thats another depression aswell. 1 more ticked off the board... no big deal. My life so far has been full of depressing things so something like this doesnt seem that big anymore.

This is only 50% of my life's shitness. If i went into everything then id prob have to spend like 1 and a half hours typing.  My life has just been an absolute mess, and what you saw my post is just a fraction of my life so far. 1 persons trauma is just a small fraction of mine.

Im a few pounds overweight and almost got an eating disorder. Its not even my fault that im fat. My mom said its because i took a medicine when i was little and it had a side effect of weight gain. I literally eat 10x less than a normal person. I dont even eat breakfast like 99% of the time on school days. I used to get bullied shitless for my weight. No social life, no friends. Thats another depression aswell. 1 more ticked off the board... no big deal. My life so far has been full of depressing things so something like this doesnt seem that big anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only 50% of my life&amp;#39;s shitness. If i went into everything then id prob have to spend like 1 and a half hours typing.  My life has just been an absolute mess, and what you saw my post is just a fraction of my life so far. 1 persons trauma is just a small fraction of mine. Those people who has a &amp;#39;dark phase&amp;#39; probably had a good phase. They had a normal life and they at least had a period in their life where they were happy. I just want to enjoy my life... is that too much to ask???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so jealous of those people who can live a normal life, in a normal nice house with 2 stories, with friends, with people to talk to. My life has just been bullshit after bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," In 2018, I found out a former ""friend"" and person I used to have sex with in 2016 was posting my naked photos to a nude sharing reddit page/kik and trading them with strangers on the internet. We lived in two different countries when I discovered this and the only thing I could do was call/email with the police in his area and inform his girlfriend at the time. The police didn't really do much, but they were able to track him down and tell him (by phone or in person, not really sure) that he should delete the images he has of me. That was all that came of it, the police couldn't really even ensure he had deleted them. His girlfriend broke up with him. I did speak to him and he sounded sorry to have been caught, he didn't seem to feel bad at all for how he made me feel. Ever since I have been struggling with this. I feel extremely violated and stupid, especially since he could still have the photos and be trading them with other people.

I was only 20 and he was 35 when we were sharing nudes and having sex, and I feel like I did something that could potentially follow me forever. I was struggling hard with mental illness at the time. I also had very little sleep and a stressful schedule, I feel like I went into some depressive spiral and I started doing dangerous and promiscuous things, including being with him. I know it's not an excuse however.

Most days I just try not to think about what happened, but some days, it comes so strong and I get an intense urge to do something bad to myself. I am currently married to the love of my life and he was an amazing support when I discovered my images online in 2018. I know doing something bad to myself would absolutely crush him, but I feel so worthless sometimes. I still feel so violated. I have the guy blocked on facebook, but I know who his current partner is and I occasionally type in the usernames he used to share images to make sure there havent been any posts since then. He still seems to have a kik username active under the same name, but I have no idea if he is still using it. The police told me it would be hard to prosecute for something like this, so telling me that I should try to get legal help is useless. I obviously can't tell most people about this, only my husband knows, so thank you for listening. It's been years now since this all happened and I still occasionally feel extremely suicidal over it, I don't know what to do to stop this.

,depression,"**Why am I like this?**

Sometimes I think about what people reactions would be if they found out I committed suicide. Sometimes I think it's the only way for people to understand and feel the pain I am feeling. I know deep down I won't do it , Cowardice and my mom still being alive is the only thing stopping me 

I travel to and from work and I would always cry on the way. I feel depressed , I know I am depressed but if you would ask me why  I wouldn't know where to start or what to say. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm depressed , I just am. Things are seemingly going well and nothing bad has happened yet why am I breaking down all the time and lashing out at others , why do i feel this familar  feeling in my chest , like I'm holding something back. Like I'm on the verge of a break down?

I'm not sure when it started but I'm so scared of people. I know my brain is telling me not to trust anyone or get close to anyone because I'll get hurt but I do it anyway. I choose to believe that this time it would be different. Now Im alone and I have nobody because I've tried to protect myself from others . Look at me now , trying to seek comfort from strangers . I feel so pathetic and useless. 

I want to be happy , I want to not care about what others think of me , I want to stop comparing myself to others and getting jealous of people my age who are more accomplished than me . I want to be happy with who I am. I want to love myself . Every year I would write in my journal my goal for the year and that would be at the top of my list. 

Do you know how tiring it i to pretend to be strong all the time ? Its my own fault. I did this. I put my guard up and pretended to be knowledgeable as if i didn't suffer from anything . Imagine , I'm the one people go to for advice. If only they knew how weak I really am . How stupid I am. I'm so tired of reading body langauage , facial expressions and voice tones and trying to decipher words to see if it has hidden meanings just to see if they are genuine . Living in fear of people and what they think of me. Absoutely breaking down at any mention of someone not liking me or liking something about me or what I did. 

Being cold and keeping people at arms length. Searching online ""meet people online"" and ""how to make friends online"" I'm 22 years old I've been typing it in for years , it dosen't work

I'm so lonely. I have ""friends"" but none of them know who i really am. I put up a front for years , now no one knows how to approach me or what to say to me if they see me . I don't reply to text messages because to me it's a waste of time because they aren't my real friends . If I don't keep them around then I'm truly a loner . 

I go out of my way to be there for them but nobody asks me if I'm okay . Nobody asks anything about me , everyone assumes I'm okay . I feel so unfulfilled. I'm unhappy with my current academia but I'm procrastinating and making it worse. I feel no motivation to study all I'm doing is destroying my life. What do I do? I cant trust anyone .

I want to be happy with who I am. I want to love myself . Every year I would write in my journal my goal for the year and that would be at the top of my list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know how tiring it i to pretend to be strong all the time ? Its my own fault. I did this. I put my guard up and pretended to be knowledgeable as if i didn&amp;#39;t suffer from anything . Imagine , I&amp;#39;m the one people go to for advice. If only they knew how weak I really am . How stupid I am. I&amp;#39;m so tired of reading body langauage , facial expressions and voice tones and trying to decipher words to see if it has hidden meanings just to see if they are genuine . Living in fear of people and what they think of me. Absoutely breaking down at any mention of someone not liking me or liking something about me or what I did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being cold and keeping people at arms length. Searching online &amp;quot;meet people online&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how to make friends online&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m 22 years old I&amp;#39;ve been typing it in for years , it dosen&amp;#39;t work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so lonely. I have &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; but none of them know who i really am. I put up a front for years , now no one knows how to approach me or what to say to me if they see me . I don&amp;#39;t reply to text messages because to me it&amp;#39;s a waste of time because they aren&amp;#39;t my real friends . If I don&amp;#39;t keep them around then I&amp;#39;m truly a loner . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go out of my way to be there for them but nobody asks me if I&amp;#39;m okay . Nobody asks anything about me , everyone assumes I&amp;#39;m okay . I feel so unfulfilled. I&amp;#39;m unhappy with my current academia but I&amp;#39;m procrastinating and making it worse. I feel no motivation to study all I&amp;#39;m doing is destroying my life. What do I do? I cant trust anyone . I&amp;#39;ve tried it for years and everyoe hasn&amp;#39;t been genuine sighs. I&amp;#39;m lost&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," 

TL;DR: Have been abused mentally and physically by both parents throughout my childhood and even now at 18 years old. Very depressed and have suicidal thoughts, failing school and have poor social life. Afraid to fight back because it will end up in conflict, someone getting hurt, and me getting kicked out of the house for the millionth time. I still care about my parents for some reason and love them, I dont know why and am hesitant to go to authorities. I have nobody to move in with, not much money, no car. What do I do? Am I a coward?

I am currently in my second semester of community college. I have lived through physical and verbal abuse throughout my entire childhood (Asian family). Beaten the crap out of every other day by drunk father, my mother is mentally unstable and controlling and also hits and insults me. Don't want to get into specifics because it would be lengthy and theres too much, but lets just say the worst thing my father has done to me was crack my head against a table and I had to go to the ER to get staples, lied and said I knocked my head into the table by accident. My mother burned me with a hair iron when I was around ten and she says stuff like I am worthless, should have never been born, etc daily. I am not a bad son, very respectful my parents just have a lot of issues that stems from being abused from their parents too and are very controlling. For much of my life I thought this treatment was normal. For example, my mother would start hitting me if I didn't address her as ""Mom"" when talking to her when she felt moody. Stuff like that, not warranted. Last semester I took difficult STEM classes to be an engineer and on the morning of my calculus final my drunk father punched me in the mouth and I bled because I did not wake my brother up for school when he overslept. I failed the final. After that I told them I wanted to join the Marines because I was sick of home, they apologized and promised to change. They still talk shit to me but haven't hit me until last week. My mother socked me in the back of the head for leaving the lights on in the staircase of the house. I felt betrayed, since this is the first time they hit me in three months and I thought they really did change. I screamed ""DONT TOUCH ME"" and glared at her fists clenched and got wrestled to the floor and swung at by my father, then kicked out of the house. Only allowed back in the house yesterday after sleeping on a park bench the whole weekend and eating fast food. (they called me and told me to come home) They apologized but I know they didn't mean it just like every other time.

I am hesitant to fight back against my parents because apart of me still loves them and who they are when they aren't angry. I also know if I yell back or hit back (never hit them before) I would get kicked out of the house so I just take it. I want to separate from them, but I have nobody I could move in with and My depression affected my social life throughout my childhood, with few friends that are all dorming at uni across state. Other extended family believe I'm a bad kid because my parents twist the stories around and make it look like I'm the bad guy, not close with any of them. I have no car, all the money I got from financial aid and scholarships my parents made me pay off their property tax. The only thing I look forward to in life anymore is when I talk to a girl I like in one of my classes, never told her about my situation. Everyone I have opened up to this about tell me that I'm being a pussy and should fight back, but that would get me nowhere but back on the street or possibly hurt and injured, and I don't want to hurt my parents.

,depression,"PPD &amp; Work?

Hi everyone… I’m 6 months postpartum and for the past couple of months I’ve been calling into work… A LOT. I’ve had depression/anxiety for years but during my pregnancy it got wayyyy worse. Anyways, I’m grateful that my job hasn’t said anything since I always have a sub (I work at a high school as a paraprofessional) but I just can’t come around to wanting to be at work anymore. I don’t want to work. I don’t want anyone watching my baby. I just want to be home with my baby. I haven’t been to work all week and want to call in tomorrow. I cry at night with the thought of going into work.

Any advice? What should I do? My boyfriend tells me to push thru until the summer at least when we’ll move into a cheaper home situation and he can be the sole provider, but I’m also about to get my income tax and I know that can compensate for my working wages until then.

My boyfriend tells me to push thru until the summer at least when we’ll move into a cheaper home situation and he can be the sole provider, but I’m also about to get my income tax and I know that can compensate for my working wages until then. I’m just so lost. Idk what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I can’t come around to taking my Zoloft consistently because I feel like it won’t help and there’s no point. I feel like I’m just broken.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi together, 

I'm working up a lot with myself lately, as it's difficult to get help in my country (in Europe) right now. Long waiting times and little chance to get good therapy. I was diagnosed with a mild depressive episode a few years ago, however I have not been well for several years. Therefore I think that this is not the whole truth

# Stress feeling

I have noticed that a lot of my behaviors can be traced back to feeling stressed.

This feeling of stress is, in my opinion, triggered by a high internal ""pressure"". This arises, for example, from the fear of being abandoned or not doing something right for someone, which could also lead to interpersonal punishments. Unfortunately, I learned in my childhood that if I criticize my mother or say something wrong, I am quickly punished psychologically. She would get loud, not talk to me for a while....

The stress also comes from the outside of course. Time pressure, self-made time pressure, fear of failure.... I am doing my PhD and have been moving up quite fast in management consultancies. The last two years have been a sprint and it has left its mark.

# Behavior

Back to that stress feeling. It takes on different dimensions:

* I unconsciously ""hurt"" myself by delicately biting my arm or scratching my nail bed. Often I just see the marks afters and think ""Oh I did it again"". I can reproduce it e.g. by playing a difficult game (e.g. Dark Souls). As soon as I die against a boss fight, I unconsciously bite my arm in the loading time.
* I get an extreme craving for sex/masturbation (multiple times a day) and would describe it as Compulsive Sexual Behavior. The orgasm is then no fun and I feel exhausted and bad afterwards. Still, I do it.
* I behave in a clingy way and thus ruin relationships because I ask several times in a short time if everything is okay or write messages to get confirmation e.g. that I miss my partner.

,depression,"I started taking depression meds a few months ago, and it make my suicidal thoughts go away. It was somewhat amazing, i had such thoughts every day and now I barely think about it at all. Even when the stray suicidal thought pops up, it feels different, less scary.

My problem is that such thoughts would help me through the day, ironiclly. If I was getting stressed I wohld think about the end of all my problems. I even began to mutter 'I'm gonna kill myself' unddr my breathe and mask during work. This was insanely unhealthy, and where I am now is much better comparatively. But the thing that worsened these thoughts is still there.

I hate my job, I have no friends, I don't know how to open up to people, and I'm terrified about having to choose what my life will be. I want to go to college, study sociology, maybe creative writing as well, but when I go to take any sort of action, I'm terrified. It's illogical, I hate it.

I work at an Amazon facility, I stow packages, I pick up boxes, and I push carts. I've working there part-time for 3 years. It was, to me at least, pathetic. So i moved to a longer shift, a small bit of action, I hate working there, but I'm terrified of trying anything else. My new shift is 10 and a half hours long, with a 30 minute unpaid break, and two 15 minute paid breaks. Yesterday was my first day. After 3 hours I went to cry in the bathroom.

I drove to work 40 minutes ago, and soon began crying. It was ugly crying, I was shivering and whimpering, on my drive to work.I didn't use to do this, when I was depressed I was much more apathetic. I had my coping mechanism, but now I don't.

I'm not saying that being depressed was better, I hated my suicidal thoughts, they would ruin my days. But I'm now noticing that they did help me get through some rough moments. It's just not something I expected. 

I know that I should speak to a psychiatrist, maybe a therapist as well. I know that quitting my job would be better for my mental health, I am lucky in that I have the ability to do so and still have somewhere to sleep and eat. I know that I think about my future, if not college with a sociogy degree, then an electrition. There are other options for me, I'm just scared and anxious.

The reason I wrote this here was to make it all feel real. Ir's easy for me to move on from these moments. But I should realise that the fear and anxiety from change can't be worse than the anxiety, and especially the self-hatred, that I feel now.

I’m falling a class in college and can’t seem to get my grade up, I can’t focus, I can’t concentrate, I stay up until 5am doing homework and studying but even though I try my best I feel like I’m not progressing. 

I don’t want my parents to think I’m a failure, I want to make them proud but I can’t find the inspiration to keep going. I feel like sh*t, anxiety haunts me everyday and I just want this to stop. I want to talk about how I feel with my mom but I don’t want her to have a bad image of me in her head, she knows I have depression and anxiety since I was diagnosed but I told her months ago that I was okay, I’m not now. 

I know that if I tell her that i feel depressed again she’s just going to tell me to keep going, my mom is not a bad mom, I love her, she has done everything for me but she doesn’t show us affection. It might been the way she was raised, but I need to her her say that she’s here for me or that she loves me. I can’t remember when was the last time she hugged me or said “I love you” I don’t feel appreciated in this house. When I try to be friendly or make a conversation with her it always ends up with her being mad, I’ve gone several times to her room just to hang out with her but it seems that bothers her, when I try and hug her she tells me to stop. I know she’ll be very disappointed in me if she discovers I’m not doing well in my class. 

She has criticized me because of what shows I watch, if I’m enjoying a video game too much she’ll tell me “that’s all you know how to do, why don’t you do something else instead of playing your little game”, she hates the music I enjoy listening, all I want is to have a mom-daughter moment but it doesn’t happen. I’ve talked to her about this several times, she cried once saying it was hard for her too and I understand hard, I know it’s hard having a touched-starved, mentally unstable daughter, that’s why I don’t want to bother her with my problems. 

When I happen to have a problem with a member of my family (aunt, uncle or cousin) she’ll always be on their side, it’s like she wants to please them, I don’t feel heard. Im 19 and on my 18th and 19th birthdays i cried, I wanted to spend my 19th birthday doing something I wanted and my parents said yes, that was until my step-dad changed his mind and choose to visit his sister on my birthday 5 hours away hour city, I was mad, I feel like I had the right to. My mom told me that I didn’t have to come with them, that I could stay in the house until they arrived Sunday night (my birthday was on Sunday) I choose to go because I didn’t want to spend the day without my family, I didn’t got to do anything I wanted, I was pretty bummed, my mom and stepdad noticed this and yelled at me saying I didn’t had to be here, that I could’ve stayed in the house, my mom did bought me a cake and ate it when I arrived home and I was grateful for that. My aunt and uncle noticed how my mom and stepdad acted on the day of my birthday and felt bad for me, they told me I should’ve stayed with them and they would’ve took me to the mall. Funny how my mom goes all the way out for his birthday or my sisters birthday. I feel like I’m a failure to them, I’m not the perfect daughter they wish they had, it’s like they just gave up on me, at least is how I see it. Every time I talk to my mom she looks at me with an annoyed face, when I told her that I’m kind of struggling with college she shrugged and told me that it’s my fully because I choose this career, it’s true but I was looking for some encouraging or caring words.

,depression,"The note is done. Written, edited, signed, done. The noose is cinched and hung. All that's left is for me to decorate the door.

I stood staring at it for what felt like an eternity.

Today, every second had felt like eternity.

I had writhed in agony watching each minute tick by, as if a lifetime had passed. 

I had tried everything I knew and I'd been told: dunked my face in cold water, but my forehead had felt red hot; meditated and focused on my breathing, but I'd retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air; took a scalding bath, for a moment I was in my skin again but then the water and I felt as one; I tried to nap, a reset was always in store, but I woke up still at death's door.

I hadn't done it yet, though. I'd never been closer, but I still hadn't done it. Before I hit send, before I decorated the door, I told myself I'd go for one last run to get out of my head.

I've been treading water the last week, just barely keeping my head up. I tried mushrooms a few days ago and for the first time in what felt like months could accept myself. In fact, I discovered I was stuck in time, two months earlier when I'd been dumped. My heart hadn't moved on, but the universe relentlessly had. And for 24 hours the mushrooms gave me clarity that I needed to move on, and even had. There was a moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly I was vaulted forward to the present. Over and around the intervening months. I was present again. But just as sudden as the revelation had fallen upon me it was stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more. 

Shakily, I put on my running clothes. I considered my route, an old standard. Roughly 3.5 miles. It'd buy me a calculated 24-27 more minutes to think about this decision. I cinched my laces, I hate these shoes. I struck out the door.

When my feet hit the pavement I realized this wasn't a regular jog. I wasn't running to run. I was running to kill myself. Or not. I'd find out along the way. Suddenly the route and distance didn't matter. I knew I'd be going further than I'd thought. I started out at a normal pace and began upping my tempo. I knew I was out of shape. I knew a single 7 minute mile would be my limit, as it had been on several of the past days. But today wasn't those days. I couldn't feel the exhaustion, the pain of my body. Moments earlier, all I could feel was my body exhausted. I was trapped in my head. I could push my body well past it's limits today, because I wasn't leaving my heart or my head until my body hurt more. 

Around the first mile I started muttering to myself: you've never outrun yourself before, but today is the day you beat yourself. And I kept running. I came upon a long flat stretch, a narrow catwalk along the water's edge, and I broke into a sprint. I was going to break myself now. I pushed until I could feel the burn in my legs, my throat and my lungs. I hadn't pushed myself like this in days, weeks, months or maybe even years. I'd forgotten what it felt like. I started feeling light-headed. This was to be alive?

But it couldn't last. I ground to a halt and walked. Finally outside my head again, but still thinking. Finally not drowning in my thoughts.

I'd realized earlier what it is in those last moments. It is quite literally drowning in your thoughts. My brain takes over, dwelling on my past failures, rejections, losses. And it's as if every iota of my brain power is diverted to these fruitless forays in my hippocampus. Every drip of processing is diverted. Suddenly my breathing reflex kicks in. I haven't been breathing. I've been drowning in my thoughts. And with it a sense of fear and dread; adrenaline courses through my aorta, spreading across my chest and dilating my bronchi. Fight or flight, from my own past?

Pushing myself achieves this same end. But what am I running for? What am I running toward? I don't know, and I feel so lost and unbound. Adrift and asea. 

I thought again ""if this is your last run, you're going out strong"" and started sprinting again. I ran, and I ran, and I ran. I ran through throngs of people amidst cherry blossoms who didn't know I was probably running to my death. But suddenly I didn't want to die anymore, at least not yet. Not now. And I started a new mantra ""this run saved my life."" And I realized I could say that every time I ran. Or biked. Or hiked. Or sat with friends. Or worked on a project. Or spoke to my mom. But to do so I'd have to get through those long, dark minutes of pure and intense pain. I'd have to learn to hurt myself, again, running, hiking, biking.

But I kept running, as fast and as hard as I could. I circled back around on my path, it was a lollipop route and I was completing the candy. And I pushed myself until I was back on the inner leg of it, the stem. I pushed myself so hard I started vomiting. In a homeless camp of all places.

I'd had nothing to eat today, and little yesterday. I was subsisting on coffee. The bile came up black, sour, bitter. Much as the coffee had been going down. It seemed a funny parallel. And I decided then that I wanted to write about this. 

I wanted to share my story, because today: I didn't kill myself. I might have, some part of me wanted to. But I ran away. And I'll keep running. It's tough. But I think I found something to run for again. I'd mostly stopped running ages ago, but I think this was the motivation I needed to start again. The rest of my life is in shambles and I don't know what I'm doing. But I can keep running. 

I'll start running with a group, I think. And each time I'll let them know at the end ""this run saved my life.""

Written, edited, signed, done. The noose is cinched and hung. All that&amp;#39;s left is for me to decorate the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood staring at it for what felt like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, every second had felt like eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had writhed in agony watching each minute tick by, as if a lifetime had passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had tried everything I knew and I&amp;#39;d been told: dunked my face in cold water, but my forehead had felt red hot; meditated and focused on my breathing, but I&amp;#39;d retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air; took a scalding bath, for a moment I was in my skin again but then the water and I felt as one; I tried to nap, a reset was always in store, but I woke up still at death&amp;#39;s door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t done it yet, though. I&amp;#39;d never been closer, but I still hadn&amp;#39;t done it. Before I hit send, before I decorated the door, I told myself I&amp;#39;d go for one last run to get out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been treading water the last week, just barely keeping my head up. I tried mushrooms a few days ago and for the first time in what felt like months could accept myself. In fact, I discovered I was stuck in time, two months earlier when I&amp;#39;d been dumped. My heart hadn&amp;#39;t moved on, but the universe relentlessly had. And for 24 hours the mushrooms gave me clarity that I needed to move on, and even had. There was a moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly I was vaulted forward to the present. Over and around the intervening months. I was present again. But just as sudden as the revelation had fallen upon me it was stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakily, I put on my running clothes. I considered my route, an old standard. Roughly 3.5 miles. It&amp;#39;d buy me a calculated 24-27 more minutes to think about this decision. I cinched my laces, I hate these shoes. I struck out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my feet hit the pavement I realized this wasn&amp;#39;t a regular jog. I wasn&amp;#39;t running to run. I was running to kill myself. Or not. I&amp;#39;d find out along the way.
