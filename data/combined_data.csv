"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,180,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",circinia,124,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tc5fpx/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/

i've always wanted someone who'd understand me

i cant understand anything, i cant find anyone that does...i just wish it would happen already, im tired of trying everything without anything working properly

im 21, by now i should've already found someone, instead no one likes me, they dont understand and dont want to, they just want friendships, and im ok with that, but that's not what im looking for

i wish i was enough for someone already, im trying my best here, why isnt that enough?

i just feel like i should've found someone in high school...believe me, it would've changed everything, not being alone by then just would've made everything much better

instead its like this now

i hate not being able to change things and make things better...it shouldnt've been like this, i should've a boyfriend, i shouldn't be alone anymore, why cant i do it already? what's wrong with me?...i always make the effort but no one seems to want to make an effort on me too

Depression managed to make my biggest passion unenjoyable,"I'm a musician, I've been playing music for nearly a decade, and I've been obsessed with music for my entire life. I always wanted to play in a band, to record music, and all that, and I can finally do all of that more or less, but it doesn't make me happy, not a little bit.

Today I had a gig, and I've always fantasized about playing live, I always wanted to. The first times I did, years ago, it was amazing; it has since turned into something I don't like to do. The need to go out, socialize, play, stay there until I can get a drive back home... It's all exhausting, unenjoyable, and I no longer feel the thrill of playing live.

I always wanted to record music, and I bought an electric guitar a while ago, got equipment for recording, and I did record some stuff, but it feels like so much work: to write, to record take after take, to mix... I just end up burned out and even more depressed at my failure.

Listening to new music feels dull, even if I like it, and my favorite songs have long since lost their essence.

Rant,"Hey y’all. 
Ive been suffering from suicidal thoughts and depression since I was 15 years old. I guess I never really processed how much I was going through until I came to college. I didn’t realize smoking and drinking everyday for months at a time at 16 years old was probably just a manifestation of my depression. I even remember writing a suicide note on my 16th birthday telling myself I’m never going to make it past my 21st birthday. That being said, my 21st is coming around the corner and my depression is overwhelming me. I simply cannot stop thinking about it. I had an exam yesterday and the entire time, I was thinking about killing myself. I know I’ve accomplished a lot so far and I am really proud of myself for everything I do despite knowing I am suffering. But it’s getting to a point where I don’t see a point in this anymore. I no longer enjoy the things I used to enjoy. I cannot even sit still for a second without the depressive thoughts overwhelming me. 
Ive already attempted once last year. I have been thinking about trying again. The only thing that’s keeping me from doing so is my boyfriend. He knows I have mental illness but does not know the extent of it. I can never tell him especially now because he recently lost his brother to suicide and it will destroy him if he found out I am also suicidal. I’m hoping I accidentally overdose on coke or something so it doesn’t seem like I was suicidal and I was just being stupid. 
Man I feel extremely selfish for even thinking this way but I feel like a complete failure in my life. Ive cut off my family and I’ve realized the majority of my issues stem from my family. But it is extremely isolating and it hurts knowing they do not care about me. I try to distract myself every way that I can by constantly working and pushing myself but I genuinely fear I will not live to see my 21st.

I regret every single thing about my life,"Every moment of every single day I drown in regret.

Sometimes I see the light and bathe in it for a while, but then soon after I find a way to dwell on everything negative.

I am a 31 (m), and I had a lot of promise up to this point. I still do, but I am stuck and finding difficulty in forgiving myself and moving forward.

I regret big things that negatively impacted my whole life...but I also regret all the smaller things that one could easily learn from and improve.

Concerning the big things...when I was 23 I left an internship doing my exact passion in life after graduating college. This was going to pave way to me getting a Master's Degree fully paid for. Like a complete idiot, I had a panic attack after reading things on the internet and believed the world was about to end (right after the 2012 hype).

And so I didn't finish my internship...and didn't take the opportunity to go to graduate school (why do this when the world is about to end, right?). I ended up losing all my professional references and reputation, which kickstarted nearly ten years of debilitating depression (and the world didn't end...I really messed that one up!).

I moved back home with my parents and completely abandoned my career path. The depression got worse, and my physical health got worse, too. I worked a menial job for years drowning in self-loathing.

And guess what...when I was 28 I was given another awesome opportunity to change my course in life. Something I was passionate about related to my career path...but I still did not move on from my previous missed opportunity. And so I found a way to sabotage that opportunity, causing me to spiral into even deeper depression.

And here I am at age 31...still living with my parents. Unable to move forward in life...still stuck in the year 2013. All I dream about is going back in time and re-doing EVERYTHING.

The last ten years I have become a negative, depressed, isolated shell of a human being. Before 2013 I was so full of passion, determination, and gratitude for life.

And when I reflect on my life the last ten years...I drown in regret, guilt, and shame. And then I feel worse because I cannot extend forgiveness to myself and move on.

I could have done so much the last ten years. I can see the path I could have taken...I could have had an amazing career and helped so many people.

And then I start regretting all the smaller things. I could have studied more in college, and I could have drank less alcohol. I could have spent more time improving myself by working out and gaining confidence. I could have experienced romantic love, but I was too proud and judgmental of others.

I could have done everything different.

Many would say that I am still young and can still do awesome things in life.

The problem is that I am so mentally scarred from years of depression. Also, my physical health is horrible. I have Lyme Disease, Hashimoto Diease (thyroid), and my teeth are rotting because of lack of self-care. And my hair is falling out due to all the stress over the years. So...I am permanently scarred from the last decade as a reminder of this time period in my life.

Also...things are harder when you are older. In college I was in a nice bubble from the real world...and I feel like I squandered it.

I want nothing more than to go back and re-do everything starting at the age of 18. I can forgive myself for things before the age of 18...but at the age of 18 was when I should have taken control of my life and health.

Even with serious introspection to derive lessons I have learned to improve myself and grow...it does not change the fact that I still messed up. I could always have made a different choice while learning those lessons. I have tried therapy for six months...doesn't work for me. It is not enough because it does not give me the time back I wasted.

Misery. I want to move on...but I just do not see how it is possible.

I have friends but I don't share anything with anyone. If any of my friends knew what goes in my head, they'd probably be too scared. I have had anxiety since my father's death. It's his death anniversary today, its been 17 years. I have had anxiety for more than half of my life.

Education about psychological illnesses is rare and its still a stigma here. I learned what i have is anxiety and my random breathlessness followed by everything slowing down is not an asthma attack but a panic attack when I was 22. Iron man 3 helped me identify it. The scene where Tony has a panic attack after a kid wants his autograph. I saw that and I was like, hmmm this feels awfully familiar. I asked a friend psychologist who said yeah that's a panic attack and she knew i had anxiety, she thought I knew because I was managing it well. She told me some breathing exercises which helped.

After my father's death, i was my mom's care taker. I have an elder sister but she was least interested. Since I was 12 I looked after her. I knew her medications and everything. I liked doing it. I was the person my mom shared her troubles with. It fucked with me cause we didn't have a lack troubles. 

I was always inquisitive and creative. I wish i could go back to being 10 or 11. Didn't have the care in the world, watching power rangers and playing.

My relationship with my mom was toxic at worst. We loved each other but we did not agree with many things. She passed away in November last year.

I was always alone, i am not a great company tbh. I'd avoid me. I liked being alone, but I am now lonely. I hate this feeling. I always knew I'd end up alone, who in thier right mind would put up with me. They shouldn't. No one deserves a fucked up person like me. But I don't want to be alone. I have no one now. I don't think I can keep feeling like this for long. I'll break.

I’ve had major depression since I was a kid and I thought I’d outgrow it but now I’m a gross almost-30 year old depressed person and I think I’m just too far gone.,"Single 29 year old female with 2 dogs and 0 kids and 0 friends. I’ve been extremely depressed since I was a kid but always thought I’d grow out of it and life would fall into place. The last 2 years have destroyed a lot of progress I made mentally because of working from home/living alone and being in complete and total isolation for over 2 years now. Was lonely before but this has been an absolute mind fuck. I have been trying my best to maintain sanity and have a shrink and decided to finish my college degree but the loneliness just stings no matter what I do to fill my time.

But lately I thought things were on the up &amp; up. Interviewed for a new position at work that’s higher paying, met a great guy I felt a connection with. College graduation is close enough now that I can see the light at the end of the “poor as fuck” tunnel. But out of nowhere, last Wednesday I got a notice that my rental company isn’t renewing my lease (not sure why, no infractions but don’t have the energy to fight it) and I can’t afford to move on such short notice as I drained my savings (which wasn’t much, just a couple thousand) about a year ago moving into this place (never live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building) and right now I only make $18 an hour so I haven’t been able to replenish savings yet. This place was a little out of my budget to begin with but it was on the lower side for rents in my area for 2 bedrooms (need an office). I just don’t have the money for a deposit, pet deposit, first months rent and paying for movers in my bank account right now. As a result I’m moving back in with my parents, 14 year old brother, and severely autistic 17 year old sister in a small house. I moved out after highschool at 18 because my mom is a high strung and mean crazy person, and with my sister being autistic and having outbursts all the time the place is a fuckin’ zoo. But this temporary move in with them will allow me to save money for a few months. 

A couple of months ago I met a guy who I really, really like and for once he seems to like me back. We made lots of plans to do a bunch of outdoorsy things like foraging and fishing because I’ve always wanted to do that stuff and he does those as hobbies already. We used to talk everyday and hung out probably 6-7 times and while we were still getting to know each other I felt like we had a good thing going with lots of potential. I told him about my having to move temporarily, and even though I’ll only be 2 hours away and work from home/have my own car so I can come see him as often as we wanted - he has dropped me as a result. Has just gone totally cold no contact and I feel like fucking shit.

I know I shouldn’t care, we weren’t dating yet. But I have such a hard time meeting men let alone decent men that reciprocate attraction. I’ve only ever had one boyfriend for 4 years and that relationship was a toxic nightmare that ended in 2017. That in tandem with the extreme loneliness I’ve been stuck inside of since being forced inside back in March of 2020, this is just such a huge let down that all seems to be coming out of nowhere. Having someone to look forward to talking to and see on a regular basis meant so much more to me than I think anyone else can understand. I am almost 30 and I’m nowhere near getting married and having kids which is honestly all I want to do with my life. So the letdown from this seems like it should roll off my back but I just cannot win. 

I cannot get close to anyone and I won’t ever be able to find a partner and live the simple life I so desperately want. On top of that I’m going to be 30 in June and I am moving back in with my parents and that living situation is going to be stressful. I’ve never been farther away from where I wanted to be. I feel utterly broken inside. If I didn’t have 2 chihuahuas who would be left unattended/unfed in the numerous days it would be before anyone noticed something was “off” because that’s how isolated I am - I would have killed myself in the garage yesterday. I made an appointment with my therapist but I can’t see her until 2nd week of April.

I don't think anyone actually likes me,"No one except my husband and like 2 friends. 

But everyone else who I try to talk to and hang out with? I feel like they just put up with me. 

No one EVER asks me if I'm okay. Even my college ""friends"" who KNEW I was self harming and suicidal. They never once asked if I was okay. 

Ex's who I sometimes still talk to, they never ask even though they know my entire history. It's so weird knowing all these people who used to be so involved in my life will just watch my Instagram stories but never even say hi. 

I try so hard to talk to people, but the conversation always ends because at some point they never text back. I try to make plans, it never works out. 

No one texts me first. It's ALWAYS me who texts first, and I am always available to talk to anyone! 

No one is ever excited to see me. No one speaks kindly of me. I'm no one's favorite friend. I am the forgotten friend, the background friend, the wallflower friend.

I'm a coward.,"I'm scared to tell people how I really feel. I worry about what people think about me. I don't stand up for myself in my relationships/friendships. I always worry about the other person, not myself. I bust my ass, I work hard to remember important info, and go out of my way to do nice things. I just let things happen to me. I'm a passive observer of my own life. I wait and hope that things work out. Because it's easier than speaking up. Even when I know something isn't right or fair. Better to keep quiet and let things run its course. Therapy didn't bring it to my attention. I've always known this about myself. Because I don't feel good enough. I never have. It's not worth the fight if it means putting someone else out..

I don't feel like people actually like me. I think people tolerate me. I think that people just see me as a stepping stone to something else. Something to keep them occupied. Like that one show you tolerated because your favorite show was on next. People don't really like me. They pity me. They feel bad and talk to me out of duty. I have some friends and they keep up the appearance and I try to do the same, but they eventually go. I feel like that's coming soon with the current ones. I'm in the downswing.

Therapy isn’t really working for me. What’s the next step?,"About a month ago my parents urged me to try therapy after being depressed for a couple years. I’ve done three sessions, and at my last session my therapist and I came up with an improvement plan. My goals were essentially to communicate better and boost my confidence. 

Look, I’ve been depressed for years and I have researched ways to improve. What my therapist outlined was nothing new to me. Moreover, I don’t have the motivation to follow the improvement plan to begin with. Getting out of bed an showing up to class is hard enough. 

Therefore, I want to try another method of improvement alongside therapy. I’ve been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for medication, but the whole mental health system really confuses me. Does anyone have suggestions about other treatments I should consider?

Fear of failure and imposter syndrome is preventing me from progressing,"As above. 

I turned 30 2 months ago.

My story is pretty much I finished my degree at 22. Poor marks due to having severe depression. I did a graduate certificate too. But still not able to get into graduate school. I tried a second bachelor degree. I caught pneumonia and ended up failing a subject by 1 mark. While studying I was visiting the doctors clinic 3 times a week to treat my skin condition to arrest it. Got diagnosed at 19.

I felt defeated and worn out. I was 23. Had 2 qualifications I couldnt use and failed my 2nd degree by 1 mark.

I spent the next year working part time. But I still had a voice inside I had to eventually go back to study

At 25 I decided to work and save. I stopped going to the doctors so I can work. I got my first full time job. It felt good being able to earn. I wanted to focus on a career. I had this drive now but still was depressed. I worked weekends to save. I made some career moves and worked and saved like a madman.

At 27 I had an anxiety attack. The voice inside me was still there. Telling me to go back. I just didnt know what to study. I made the jump to sales. I did well with this company. I have been able to hold down every job I have had.

Just turned 30. Massive anxiety attack. I quit my career in sales. I had changed to another company and job killed my confidence. I felt defeated again. I also found it repetitive and felt like I was able to do alot better. Severe depression. Cant sleep. Lost motivation. I still feel I need to study. But I fear failing again. I fear not getting anywhere. I fear being a bum at 35-40 with no marketable skills. I havent been able to move out yet despite having a significant amount saved up. I was wanting to move out but now I feel I cant do it just yet.

I just got a role now as a sales analyst. And I get negative thoughts that I will fail and will not work out. I feel like I am punching way above my weight.

If I have a job I underestimate myself and get negative thoughts and dont feel good enough.  If I dont have a job, I get anxiety that I will be a bum and unemployable.

Its becoming too much. I want to move on with my life and make something of myself.

I have recently started seeing a therapist and jumped on meds. Ive managed to do ok so far but I feel I now need some extra help for that extra push.

Any guidance from anyone? I cant take this anymore. Its like I am trapped by my own thoughts. I want these mental restrictions to go.

When I remind her that it’s not actually that easy for me because I’m mentally ill, she just pushes it asides. It makes me so angry. I am so fucking tired of being told that I have a great life.

Instead I keep hearing comments about how I should just start working out to be happy, or that she envies my easy life. I cannot remember a time where I ever had an easy life. I always struggled so much because of my undiagnosed autism and the anxiety it caused.

Long-term trauma and burn-out in high school is making it VERY hard to let go of self-sabotage in high school,"I don’t have even energy to write this (or go to the restroom 🚽 at this moment) but I need to. I need to talk about to release from my system. I wish I could talk about this with dad, mom, etc. someone really close to me. 

Anyways, in high school, I was always insecure because girls in my HS were horrible to hang out with, disrespectful to me, and do not take me seriously at all. We were 20 girls, not like in college, my options were really limited. I had to endure and spend my time with horrible people every single day, every single minutes of school time, etc… Maybe I’m stronger out it but it left me wounds …. Wounds ….. real wounds … 

They were so smart and I wasn’t one of them, so that made everything harder. Instead of doing the work, I would wonder how do they do it. Teachers love a couple of superior groups where you can obviously see they love them more. I hate it. It was horrible every day thing, I didn’t know any better. Everything was closed to me. 

Due to all this, I was anxious, really anxious all the god damn time 24/7 IT WAS HURTFUL. Me, myself, had stigma of doing to a therapist, was out of question and out of budget. So, I kept suffering, I kept suffering in silence of anxiety, depression, constant daily crying because of school not caring about mental health and my own mental health. They didn’t care at all and once our teacher said you have to come to school even if “mental health.” I don’t know how much she believes, maybe she was joking, but it’s not even something to be said or considered at the slightest. No teacher will compassionately extend a due date because you were having mental health. Unlike college, all of them didn’t care. You could straight up tell a teacher you’re having a hard time, they wouldn’t reply to that but will reply to anything school-related you say. Looking back and considering they were “close” teachers and there was a high academic proximity between us is REALLY REALLY FUCKING SHUCKING LUCKING SUCKING TOXIC. It’s SOOOOO TOXIC. 

Again, I was I would say and release this to someone who loves me like my dad but I know that he will internally judgme and say in his mind that “I’m complex”… and HE WILL SEE ME LESS, which probably hurts me a lot. Contrastingly, I think TRUE TRUE freedom and liberally is not giving a fuck what you’ll dad or a loved someone will say when you know it’s the right thing, because it’s the right thing, you should say it and release it ANYWAY! 

Anyways, due to depression I couldn’t r finishing school work on time so I forced extensions on teachers, everything built up, I had LARGE GOALS that were very overwhelming and I didn’t make them smaller until the last second. I was so overwhelming by my LARGE GOALS.. maybe I could have make them smaller….

So, this is a regular routine for me for 8 months
• self-hate (How can I not do the work?)
•severe and persistence body anxiety 
•loneliness (no one to share my experience with, they think I’m an A+ student but I struggle with putting time and patience into my studies (and now I learnt that’s ok)
•depression 
• disorganization 
• no community (toxic school environment) 
• no exercise 
• not really healthy food 
• And more crying, worry, anxiety, and more anxiety 

For a period of time my stress hormones were unhealthy always HIGH !! HIGH!!

I was always in Panic Mode !! Panic Mode !! Stress!! Worry!! Disorganization !! Not good enough !! 

U get the point ^^^^ this was me 


And now thankfully I’m n a better position, but till now I have my inclination to self-sabotage. It feels like me, and letting go of it is VERY FUCKING HARD. Life is about last minutes stuff and worry, so having my life to be finally •good• puts A LOT of scary uncomfortable emotions for me.

"Yikes. I finally got health insurance, went to a doctor, and found out that I've lost 35lbs in 6 months... not in a good way.","I'm a man, late 30's. 6'1"". I used to walk around at 180, 185.

Went to the doctor today and weighed in at 150. I knew I wasn't eating much but good lord.

To expand: When I'm stressed or anxious, I stop eating, often for many days. It's not a body image thing, I just lose my appetite and drink water. And beer.

Gee, I wonder if losing 35lbs in 6 months has something to do with my mental state /s?

It's no wonder I'm in wounded animal mode all the time. Why I'm an asshole. I'm starving.

This isn't all bad - my blood pressure was borderline hypertension a couple years ago, and now it's super low. So there's that.

But I just wanted to share that I've not been taking care of myself for well over a year, and the result is fatigue, massive weight loss, and probably an eating disorder.

So to my fellow depressives: make an effort to eat food. If you can, good food. It makes a difference. Not eating makes it worse.

Confused,"I feel like my whole life I’ve been looking for prestige and respect, wishing and hoping I could find a job that allowed me to become the workaholic I always wanted to be. Recently I’ve started a new job that not only pays well, but is very prestigious considering my age, and most grown adults would kill to get similar pay. The only downside is that the company is so understaffed that most days are at least 12 hours long, and everyone gets one day off every other week. Even tho it’s a job I’ve always wanted it’s been bumming me out knowing I’m gonna essentially loose my personal life for 2 maybe even 3 years (that’s only a guess based on whether or not we’ll get more people) i feel like I’ve always wanted this but now that it’s on my plate it’s been crushing my soul and bumming me out to an unbelievable extent. I’m only 19 so it’s not like I’m running out of time or anything but it’s still really hard hearing my friends talk about the cool places they went to together, or the funny stories they took part of together. On the contrary before I started this job I had a lot of free time and I’d always be incredibly anxious about sitting around, I always felt like I should be doing something. I don’t really understand the emotions I’m feeling or why I’m feeling them, which is probably why I feel as bad as I do. I think another issue I’ve been having is my lack of dating life, I don’t have a girlfriend and I used to tell myself that I’d eventually get one but I don’t even think Id have the time to even go out on a simple date which has also been crushing me, making me feel lonelier then I really am.

I have serious cancer symptoms,"But I'm not sure I want to check them. 

I don't think I have the will to fight, if there's something wrong with me. The only things that keep me going are my girlfriend and my niece who suffers from mental disability and I think I'm the only one who consistently treats her well. Unfortunately I feel like my girlfriend is getting more and more fed up with my negativity and general behavior and I can't even say I blame her, so often I question, if I'm even good for her (spoiler alert I'm not:) ). As for my niece, my family often makes me feel like I'm spoiling her too much and maybe they're right too. I thought I was helping, but possibly I was just making things worse for her due to projecting what I felt as a child (endless need for care and love) onto her. I didn't want her to feel the way I felt. 

Otherwise I've been rather mediocre in everything I do. I barely have the skills and capability to do any job, even seemingly the most simple ones. I live with my parents and I can fool myself with the property market being shit and stuff, but yeah. The worst thing is that I can't even say I have a great and kind personality to compensate for anything. I'm full of anger, disappointment and resentment. 

I would lie, if I said I'm not a bit scared of cancer, but I think it's what I deserve. It would be kind of a fitting end to a rather mediocre life, but I can't complain. I fell in love, I loved and I was loved, I experienced some other nice things in life, so if the end is nearing I have to accept it with dignity and maybe even gratefulness that I won't have to suffer mentally anymore.

There is no help for people like me,"I don't think I have some genetic condition that determines my mental illness. I think my depression is learned.

I am 21, and the loss of 4 years of my teenagehood due to self-isolation made me think about how I will spend the rest of my life, because I know the pain realising the time that passes is never coming back.

I am a deep thinker since I know myself and the more thoughs I gave to this problem, the more I saw there is something missing. I dove into philosophical questions, which have no answer and paradoxes life offer.

The more I know, the more I feel I know nothing. It all seems to end in life being meaningless, my actions being meaningless, people I know, I dont and the world being meaningless. There is never enough, there is never a certainty, no definitive answer, pain, suffering and tragedies and all of this is because of nature of world itself.

I really think the concsiousness of our own existence, which is one of the factor diving us and rest of the life is a good evolutional tool, which prooved efective until now, but a giant mistake that can end it all.

I believe society works due to people being distracted whole life chasing pleasures and goals set by civilization and society, but a lot of people especially in elder ages seems to realize this fact due to their time coming up, realising they will disappear without leaving a mark and without knowing what they even wanted to achieve.

This all leaves me paralysed and suicidal. There is no help, because all psychologists, psychiatrist, therapists, people around me, self help books, webs are very quiet about this topic, or giving a really vague text.

They seem to focus on trying to prove I can make the purpose of things I want, but thats impossible, I can disprove that. Then they try to show the good things in world, like pleasures, basic human needs, etc, but none of this have any sense, if life does not make sense.

Need a few advices,"There's this girl, well, was I mean. 

We were in a long distance relationship for almost a year, didn't end well.
The fact is that I've started loving her over the time spent with her, I haven't even seen her face till about 4th month of our relationship. She was perfect, or a perfect liar. I don't know but I'm not gonna whine and cry, I'm over with that. Also it was my first ever relationship. I'm an asocial introvert with only 2 friends whom I had my whole life, she easily won me. We had a lof of ""breakups"" and you know, broke me in million pieces. I'm very busy with highschool and sometimes I just cannot get my mind off her, can't study, I can't even find another girl, her face just flashes every time I look at another girl and we broke a year, month and a few days ago ironicly, I still think about the day I've met her. Its next month and it will officially be 2 years of the event that changed my life. 

The advice I'm asking for is not to forget her, I just don't want to. All I want is for her to remain a great chapter in my life, not something that will keep eating me on the inside till my own death. I'm better, I've got better over months, honestly. Well maybe I just learned how to cope and there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about her. Please help, i still love her

I lost so much without even realizing it,"The last year has been the worst of my life until now.

 A year ago I had everything to be happy. I was a successful student in one of the best schools in my country, I had many friends, the perfect loving girlfriend, hobbies. Life was perfect for me, I was so happy and I couldn't imagine being in a better situation. 

But slowly, depression crept it and killed all that without me even realizing what was happening.
 At first I started dropping out of classes. I tried finding excuses for that lack of interest ""I just have too much going on, I need to reduce my workload"" or ""the teacher is really bad and uninteresting"".

Then I started getting irritated by my group of friends, I started isolating myself with my girlfriend. After a few months, I pretty much only had my girlfriend in my life : I didn't go to classes at all anymore, I avoided any social encounter with my old group of friends. I lived with my gf at that time, and I would just stay in bed all day not doing anything. I would lie to my girlfriend telling her I spent the day working or something like that.

I didn't realize I was in depression back then, I thought I was just a shitty person. I thought I was uninteresting, I didn't have any passions. I thought I was lazy, unsociable. I was terrified by the idea that my girlfriend would see the ""real me"". 
A few months later I realized it was not normal, I went to see a psychiatrist to get help, I was first only diagnosed depressive and then a few weeks later we realized I was actually bipolar.

But at that time it was already too late, my girlfriend ended up breaking up with me, and I don't blame her. I had been a shitty boyfriend for too long, and she had issues of her own to deal with.

I ended up at a mental health hospital for a month until I was sufficiently stabilized. Now I've been out for a few weeks but I'm still very depressed. I have suicidal thoughts everyday and nothing brings me the slightest pleasure. The rare occasions where I manage to go outside I end up crying all my tears in public and feel even worst afterwards because I can't do anything.
Sometimes I wish my girlfriend would be there for me, I need her so badly right now but I can't ask that from her, and I don't want to depend on her for my mental health.

My last hope to get out of that depression is also what frightens me the most : I'm supposed to leave for the United States in a week to do an internship for 4 months. I feel like this might help me alongside my medication to get back on track, to change environment. But I'm also terrified of how I'll feel there, that if that doesn't work out, nothing will.

I feel like I ruined my life.," 

I    started my accounting degree at 2019 at distance form because we   didn't  have enough money. I pretty much fell into believing the myth   that it's  easy cuz it has math. Back in high school, I failed to learn   proper  study habits and effectively whatever I studied was forgotten   roughly a  week after the test. During my first college exam, I was   terrified- I  had a month to study two subjects and barely could   remember anything.  And then, the professor said ""You can use your   books.'' And with liberal  book use i ended up acing the exam. Most   exams after that were open  book, and i aced and aced. But my problem   remained - whenever I tried to  study, I could barely focus. I didn't   tell my parents, because i didn't  want to worry them. Then COVID hit,   and I was introduced to the  ''wonderful'' online school, which   additionally impacted me. The final  hit was, when after my second year   my father got sick with throat  cancer. I saw the strong, wise man that   had raised me be reduced to a  bed-ridden, diaper using shell of a   person. My focusing ability crashed  to zero. Barely anything   registered, I was apathetic to everything(I  still am), I had no energy,   I stopped caring about accounting. But I  kept acing and acing. My   father died December last year and I felt that  my world had stopped.

Flashback   to  today, I have excellent grades, but my head feels(and probably is)    empty of anything, but the barest, most elementary basics. I STILL   can't  focus and remember, no matter what i try. Roughly after 15 months   i  will have to intern at an accounting firm for month and half if I   want  to get my degree. I feel utterly fucked, I've never had a job, I   hate  myself, I ponder suicide constantly.

Honestly    at this point I don't care about being an accountant, i just want job    that i don't utterly hate that pays at least slightly above minimum   wage

Why depression sucks the joy out of everything?,"I feel like dead inside and extremely sad almost all the time. Because of these feelings I not wanting people to overwhelm with my problem tend to isolate myself from people around me. It is this weird cycle that as a consequence of numbness and sadness that I feel within me I have no interest in anything, which leads to faking some emotions in conversations as not to be awkward with people in my job environment (although making matters even worse) which fuels my depression even more  because at the end I find myself beating up for not being authentic. That being said, I know where this sucker of life comes from. Growing up I have experienced a lot of family violence combined with quite a lot of verbal and physical abuse towards me. My mother was truly a horrifying person to me as a child. Human brain is so flexible in children that all of the words being said to me destroyed me which led to thinking negatively (self hatred) a lot. It takes a lot of time to destroy that pattern once it has been established. All of this lead to the point that I had an extreme form of social anxiety where talking to any person would be so much stress that it gave me panic attacks (I have overcome this by myself though not fully, talking is painful still). Now being an adult,  a lot of thing that I went through made me hate my mother although as a family we have been making some improvements. I tried the past stay in past because I'm tired of being angry and hateful, it sucks away my soul and life, love out of me. But I cannot help but feel the same way. I have moved away from my parents to lessen the hate I feel towards them especially to my mother. To some degree it helped to subside the hatred. I'm now trying to solely focus on present and stop bothering the past and play the blame game. But extreme sadness and apatia overwhelms me so much sometimes I cannot function. It prevents me from following any meaningful relationship because I don't want to spread my misery.",jiolpanora,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnx4qz/why_depression_sucks_the_joy_out_of_everything/

Im destroying my life and i cant figure out why,"I dont even know how or where i am supposed to start . Lets just say that last year i failed a certain important exam . I had been preparing for this exam since 5 years of highschool . I had no real friends , never went to parties , never cultivate any meaningful support group for foavour of studying . Why exactly did i study ? Not for myself , but for my family . I come from a dirt poor family and my parents cant possibly pay for my higher education unless i attain a scholarship by myself . Also thw situation at home was a disaster . My parents never had the happiest of marriages and i grew up between their arguments . I would pretend to be asleep and hear my mom scream stuff like ' i should have left you and the kid behind when i had the chance ' and accuse my dad of cheating on her and my dad threatening to hurt her if she didnt shut up and so on. Whatever be the case , my parents were always supportive of me . Maybe in a way i represented the dreams they never fulfilled . Whenever i would be good to them and score good grades there would be peace at home . And that motivated me to keep performing harder . They never were satisfied with my efforts , always pusing me to get better grades , work harder , but i never minded that because i knew good grades mean they get to brag about it and that means they are in a good mood . Alternatively , everytime i failed to live up to their expectations or disobeyed them in any way , all hell would break loose . My dad would scream at me and my mom would break down , calling my ungrateful and spoiled and so on . So i pretty much lived for my parents and never said anything when they enrolled me in coaching for med school scholarships. The exam was last year and i failed . And since then ive been breaking apart . I dont understand what is wrong with me , but ive been blanking out , i cant remember stuff anymore and am having concentration problems . I cont focus during the day and cant sleep at night . I waste my time on my phone . Things at home have also gotten worse . Mom breaks down almost everyday now , they both fight more often , more viciously . I realise the only way i fix this , the only way to make everything okay is to pass the exam this year . But im not so sure i can do that . And that thought frightens me . I have been seriously contemplating suicide . Its almost become an obsession with me . I dont want to think about it but it still sticks to my brain , the thought that i shall inevitably have to die because i cant possibly succeed this time . I try hard to study , to focus , to get back my enthusiasm , but its as though my mind is hell bent on dying . And all this makes me feel guilty . I mean really guilty . Guilty for tricking my parents , for taking the easy way out , for not trying hard enough , for hating on my parents , even for being so depressed because i have no right to be . My parents , though they have been less than perfect , have never physically abused me in any way  . There are moments where they are affectionate and nice to me . Its just they are very unpredictable and have emotional outbursts at times . I mean why shouldnt they , their son is tricking them behind their backs . I really dont know what to do and i feel like im losing my grip on reality . I want to make this right , i want to redeem myself , i want to not be this disappointing loser anymore , but yet its as though a part of me just takes over and makes me return back to procrastinating again . I dont know what to do , where to go , i cant talk to my parents beacuse they wont entertain this in anyway . I just feel like im heading towards my doom and i have no control over it .

Some signs of depression?,Is oversleeping a sign of depression? I just feel exhausted and for real slept till 330 in the afternoon after going to bed around 10 the night prior. I have some other signs but I feel like this is one of the more stand out ones. The whole mind literally depresses the body? Makes you feel tired and hopeless ?

how do I help my partner please,"I have been with my partner for 14 years.
Over the past five years he has developed severe depression and anxiety.

He describes how I have been a failure at basic communication for many years now, and that has been described as the primary cause of what has now become severe depression. Not listening, not following conversation, getting confused with the flow of conversation, not being able to recall conversation, using incorrect words etc. When he is in a crisis point and I am trying very hard to help, the conversation quickly turns to my communication failures as opposed to the original reason why he reached crisis point.

His addiction to weed is blamed on me. He describes how five years ago he said we needed to be more active, do more with our free time. He says I didn't do enough, nothing changed, and so he turned to cannabis. This was initially out of boredom but has grown into a severe addiction. He is spending hundreds of pounds a month, putting himself into a large amount of debt, on weed. At it's worst he cannot go more than 4 hours, Inc. Over night, without smoking. He places all blame for this addition on me.

Last year he tried therapy and a low grade of anxiety medication via the GP. When suggesting we need to seek professional help again now, he rejects the idea. He doesn't need a 'third party' to point out all of my flaws, he says. 

As a consequence, everything is placed on my shoulders. He states I'll have blood on my hands if I don't 'fix it'. He states everything is on me, and if I express my concern with that (stating I am crippled by that pressure, I can't cope with the pressure, I need to seek help from elsewhere) I am told I am being selfish.

I have tried to explain how I am trying as hard as I possibly can to improve, but I cannot try any harder. I am pushing myself to the absolute limit to be the person he needs me to be. 

I'm experiencing the severe impacts of secondary emotion; very often called damaging words, cruel insults, with hurtful things said about my family, and verbal threats of extreme violence. I have learnt to not react to these words as they are secondary emotions (and this is also what is expected if me, if I were to react to these words I would be harshly criticised). But this doesn't make them any less damaging to hear.

In short, he is very, very sick. He places all blame for his sickness on me, and also solely looks to me to solve all of his problems.

I am really struggling with this and I don't know what to do now. Please help me.",Ok_Conclusion_2098,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnhhw4/how_do_i_help_my_partner_please/

I get depressed even from just thinking about it, like why did I have to go through all that, why am I so pathetic why is my life so miserable.I've heard of cases where people are depressed for 12 years, I wonder what was it that caused that they had to battle it for so long, they have it much worse off than me.Hence I written this post today because I wanted to know what were the reasons for other people's depression, if you don't mind opening up I would give a listening ear :).

My parents are extremely unreasonable and I just want to run away,"With my parents, my best isn't good enough and no matter what I do I get yelled at. Literally the only way to avoid getting in trouble with them is to just sit at home and never do anything fun because every time I do all it turns into is a fight. 

I literally think they deserve to see me dead, or have my run away, and know it's their fault. That's literally the only way they'd ever learn or take me seriously. 

Or at least, I should say that about my Dad. My Mom really does try and I don't think she's the problem, but she always gets roped into what my dad thinks and ends up agreeing with him in the end. 

Just today I went out with my friend. We have to use busses to get anywhere because we're too young to drive on our own (we're 16, you need to be 18 to drive without an adult), which means I completely rely on public transportation being on time in order to get home at a certain time. My Dad wanted me home by 8. 

I started heading home BEFORE 6, giving myself a ton of time. I literally did the best I possibly could have done. But I still ended up being 10 minutes late. The busses in my area are slow and absolutely terrible. 

And of course my dad acts like it's somehow my fault that the buses weren't on time. I gave myself a ton of time to get home, I did my best, and it's still not good enough for him. I wasn't even that late.

This has happened time and time again where he makes a big deal out of a few minutes, or acts like something is my fault when it was completely out of my control. I'm tired of being yelled at by him and I'm tired of having privileges taken away for things that I didn't even do wrong. 

And of course the first thing I hear as soon as I walk through the door is how bad my makeup looks and how I should stop wasting my money on stupid things. 

What's even the point in trying if I'll get in trouble anyway? May as well ignore his time altogether. I'm so done.",Raven1082,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tne7g2/my_parents_are_extremely_unreasonable_and_i_just/

Need help figuring out where to go next,"I'm a musician, 24M, have no real job besides occasionally driving for food delivery, but some recent life events have made my motivation to do things really limited. I lost my mom unexpectedly during the pandemic, I developed menieres disease (which causes severe hearing loss in my one ear and intense unannounced vertigo), and now I am likely losing my partner for their personal issues, which, I want them to do what's best for them, but it hurts. I'm living in the house my mom owned, but I only have limited money in the bank and have no steady source of income to pay for it myself. I can still last off of it for years but it feels terrible. It's just stressful, and I don't know what step to take to progress.

My goal has always been to have a job in the games industry doing sound work, whether it be sound design, audio programming, or composing, but having menieres disease has made something I love (music and sound) into something I feel uncomfortable listening to. I went to college for music, and had so much support from my parents growing up with music and to just have the joy of it taken away literally overnight by a disease I have no control over, it's made things really hard. I don't know anything else, and I don't know what skill I could develop otherwise.

I think I'm having trouble now with losing things and people who mean something to me, and the amount of it is just making me halt in my tracks. I want to pursue the career I want in spite of my condition, but it's so much easier said than done, and I don't think an employer is going to be happy to hire someone who deals with hearing loss and vertigo in a job that needs use of their ears.

How can I tell if I’m actually clinically depressed?,"Hello, I really need some advice or personal stories or whatever you guys got for me. I feel like I’m in a really tough spot. I feel for the past 3.5+ years I’ve been depressed and possibly a little anxious but I don’t know if I’m actually like medically depressed like my brain chemistry is actually messed up or if I’m just going through hard times. The only time I was ever depressed in my childhood was in elementary school I was bullied for about a year and a half and had extreme anxiety to the point I couldn’t sleep at all and was being prescribed sleep medicine. Other than that I feel I’ve always been extremely positive, happy, go getter, motivated, class clown, happy person. Just the past 3.5ish years I’ve felt completely defeated and like its chipping away at me. I really don’t know how to tell if I really can clinically depressed and what help I need. I’ve already spoken to my doctor and I recently started seeing a therapist. 

I just feel very demotivated almost always, I procrastinate everything, I don’t really get anything more than the bare minimum done everyday for example, college assignments, go to work every week, somewhat consistent gym, that’s about it. I want to do much more. Some days I feel immensely more sad and just heavy. I have also recently started experiencing panic attacks maybe? Like my hands and feet kind of feel tingly or numb and my chest feels really tight like it’s hard to breath. This really only happens when I’m alone thinking a lot. Normally in public, at work, at school I’m a pretty confident person. I like to take charge and lead and I’m fairly social but still have these really depressive feelings like I’m just always super sad and normal things that should make me happy haven’t been for these past 3.5+ years and I feel I can’t control myself to do more throughout the day or make myself happier. 

My doctor prescribed my escitalopram(lexapro generic) 5mg to try but I’m really scared. I’ve always been against antidepressants. I don’t want it messing up my brain chemistry, permanently changing or damaging me or making my condition worse. I’m just worried about so many different side effects and the whole unnaturally messing with the brain scares me. 

It also scares me because what if I’m not actually depressed or anxious and I’m still taking this? How can I really know if I have these mental conditions? 

I’m sitting here typing this considering whether I should take the first pill of escitalopram and try it daily but I really don’t know what to do.

Can people who are clinically depressed help themselves naturally to be a normal functioning person or do some people absolutely need antidepressants to ever function normally?

"Bullied by the same guy for 4 years, parents divorced, lost 8 friends, developed extreme PTSD and depression.","
I know this won’t get any attention, and I don’t really want much, just maybe guidance from another with similar experiences. I know that sounds weird, but I just wanted to share what I’ve been through. I’m not looking for any new friends, for reasons explained later if you read that far. (Also sorry for shitty grammar, I’m pretty retarded.) (Also this is a repost my post got removed in another sub) (Repost repost because I don’t know where else to put this)

So, on with the “story” now. It started when I had to move to Texas because of my dad’s job, which I was not very excited about. The move from Virginia to Texas was a massive change in my life, and that’s when everything started going downhill. Due to the sadness of leaving my life-long home in Virginia, I stopped eating as much and still don’t for some reason. I did make a lot of friends, met the bully, who I’ll just call “Ass” and was having a pretty below average time, until the divorce. My parent’s divorce completely changed the way I thought and lived. I stopped making friends, stopped talking to people, and that’s when the minor self-harm started with my fingernails. After the divorce, my dad, the one with the job, stopped helping us pay for the house. The bullying from Ass got worse and worse, and I couldn’t defend myself due to anxiety and being just weak overall. My mom, who I decided to stay with, thought of moving into an RV due to money issues. Then the move to the RV happened, and I just didn’t know how to feel about it. 

Ass still bullied me by stabbing me with pencils, kicking me, and picking me up and throwing me due to my tiny frame from under-eating. This led to my severe PTSD, so I have a huge fear of being around potential people to meet, due to not wanting to go through the same experience with Ass. One day, I really lost all hope I had. So I was on Discord, with the remaining friends I had, and gave one of them admin over my server. This short part may seem stupid, but I was traumatized by Ass. So my best, most trustworthy friend, whom I granted the admin, started to do a “minuscule amount of trolling.” He made a rival server, planned an attack using bots, made a shitty diss track, and called my server corrupt and garbage due to my lack of trust in most people, while all my other friends were against me too. This is what caused me to lose 8 friends, which were all I had. That event evolved my PTSD tenfold, and caused my self-harm to become more rampant, using sharp objects. After that school year ended, my mom decided to put the RV to use, and take a trip across the country. Although I had escaped Ass, I still had to be cooped up with my sister and mom, which was not ideal for me. The trip was nice, and I am still on that very trip, but my mental health has been deteriorating. I don’t know how to feel, as I am having violent dreams and ideas of hurting others, but that goes against my own morals. I don’t know if I’m the victim, or I’m the reason of how I am. It’s just confusing, and I had to put this somewhere. 

I shortened this a lot, excluding a view major details for privacy of course, but I hope at least one person understands a little. 

TLDR: Got bullied, developed quite a few mental issues, and parents got divorced. I moved into an RV, having to be cooped up with my mom and sister. My mental health rapidly deteriorated, and still is.

Urge to completely withdraw from every human being,"I'm writing this in multiple subs since I'm not sure where it belongs.

Do you ever get the urge to completely withdraw from people? 

You feel exhausted from even thinking about being in social settings. Whether that be meeting friends, family, going to the supermarket, the park, even just greeting your neighbour or stepping outside where you know you'll see people. 
You don't want to talk, noises are especially stressful on these days, you can't take a lot of input. Reading or doing another peaceful hobby in the quiet of your room, no one near you, seems like the only thing that doesn't stress you out. And by stressing out I mean if you ignore this urge and step out nevertheless you're guaranteed to get a panic attack.

Not the usual I feel drained from social interactions, or I'm stressed I can't focus on anything or being exhausted for other reasons. It's the desire to hide from everyone that might interact with or just perceive you no matter the duration. I do wish I had a cave no one knew about far away from everyone where I can hide for these days.


It doesn't last for long, sometimes only one day, rarely more than three days. And then it doesn't happen again for weeks.

I'm curious wherever some of you might experience the same, if you know what it means and where it comes from. 
If so then what do you do on these days? Do you just ignore it, accept a few very stressful days? Does it go away after a while? Or do you listen to the urge and hide at home for as long as it lasts?

Why is living so hard? I'm just tired.,"I have never gone to a therapist. I'm 18, I don't know if I have depression but it looks like it. 

Sometimes I'm normal and then out of nowhere I feel bad again. Is my life going to be like that alltime? I can't do this anymore, it is like everytime it just gets worse and no one notices it because I am functional and I laugh, eat and talk just fine. It's just that there is always this void inside me and I can't explain it, but it is there and makes living so difficult. I dont know if it is my personality, but I would give so much to be normal.

I just noticed that compared to other people, my happy moments aren't so happy and my bad moments are the worst. It's like everything I feel is out of proportion. I am so tired of trying to be better, of pretending that I'm fine.  I am so afraid it is going to be like this all my life, because I am miserable and I don't know if it is worth it if I am going to continue feeling like this.

I have been trying to contact a therapist. It is so expensive. I just can't expect my mother to pay that considering I function just well. I am afraid she will see me differently if I ask her to do it. I tried to contact a free therapist from a community service but they don't answer. I just can't do this anymore. I am from a third world country and mental health isn't considered important. I know that my grandmother and uncle both have depression, and they both deal with it all fucking time.

Life feels like a scam,"I'm just not sure if the positives really outweigh the negatives in life. Is short-lived joy through escapism and consumerism really worth the long-term suffering? Is 100 hours of Elden Ring worth getting shit on every day at work and barely being able to cover rent? Then you consider the things that you enjoy are usually contributing to the suffering of others. It feels like everything is just this big game of hot potatoe where you offload pain to others for relief. 

I tell people these things &amp; I'm told not to think too much about it--it's just how things are, suck it up, try and save money to get ahead. Yet, what will this money do for me? It will never be enough to buy my freedom or to live for myself. Isn't that really the only value of money? I just look at my parents...worked so hard their whole lives &amp; they dont really have anything to show for it. They can't properly enjoy retirement (financial reasons too) because how are you supposed to pick up the pieces at 60 years old? It feels like working really hard to make the perfect pizza but you can't afford the tomatoe sauce...so it's not even really a pizza. Just futility. 

The collective cognitive dissonance just leaves me in awe &amp; I feel like an alien.Sometimes I feel like I'm in this weird simulation where the only way to win is to unplug. Once you do, you wake up and there's a team of people cheering, &amp; congratulating you for passing the experiment. Yet then...you'd just be trading one dystopia for another I guess! I'm just hoping for a miracle: maybe aliens abduct me, I win the lottery, I become super successful in my hobby, a pile of rare space minerals fall in my backyard, a billionare develops an irrational crush on me. This is how far I'm reaching! It's hard to just continue on hope...I wish to find what I'm looking for.

I have no life and keep disappointing my partner,"Depressed for at least 6 years and married for two. It was a quick courtship and I don't think my husband knew what he was in for, although I didn't hide my depression at all. He keeps on trying to get me to 'improve my life' when I've tried everything (exercising, eating healthy, did activities, put myself out there etc). But now I'm sick of it and just want to sleep and distract myself all day, and he's getting increasingly tired of having to help me through my bad days.

I don't want to keep disappointing him. I would rather be alone than be a burden. I'm slightly envious too that he lives his life normally with friends, activities etc when I've never known a life free from anxiety and depression.

Im so fucking tired, 
I have dealing with what i call sadness waves as early as I could remember, and it effected my memory so bad cause I can’t even remember my childhood i just remember being sad. 

For most parts I could handle these waves, i had control over them, i belt a strong wall that can handle it it did break down years ago when i was in 8th grade i had horrible melt down would cry in class and my friends were worried they like to think that they were the one that helped me and i let them believe that but the truth is I’m the one that pulled myself up and I learnt how to handle it better and mor important how to hide it and not let anyone see what I’m going throw otherwise i would look like a little kid that is begging for help and I would look pathetic and be pathetic. 

This waves started to come more often to a point where they are non stop i have been telling myself it’s okay i go throw this sometimes i know I always get out of this “ mood swing “ it’s okay just hang a little more its not my first rodeo but more than half a year have passed and the wave is getting bigger and I’m getting tired. I’m just tired at this point. I’m really really tired. And I don’t think i can handle it myself but I don’t have anyone to turn to.

The feeling of being a parasite of my family,"I just want somewhere to vent. Sorry if this bothers you



Let's short it up. My mother had me when she was like 18 with my dad(17 at the time) ever since I was born I lived with my dad side (grandparents, aunts) I've never seen my mom. I also rarely make any contact with my dad cuz he moved to another place and had a new family. Well all these made me think that no one loves me. But aight



And tbh that makes me feel like I shouldn't be born on the first place. I tried to go to therapy when I was in middle school but I just couldn't express all my problems because they had my aunt sitting next to me during the session. So I just lied about being bullied at school for being gay blah blah. They gave me some prescription and just that



It did seem to get better but No. Lately over the past year I just feel like I'm a mistake and just some parasite of the family. Like the rest of my family would live in their better lives without me. I feel like wishing my mom to abort me in the first place.



Whenever my family buy me something nice or take me to anywhere. I just always think to myself ""Their lives would be easier If I was aborted in the first place"" like my family would be better off without me



And I also struggling with being insecure about myself (my face, my body, my future, my education) so all of them combined just makes me feel worse about myself harder and harder everyday



Any advices? Maybe something I could do to feel better about myself 



Thanks for the advice (If theres any). just want to be here and vent cuz I don't know where else I would express my feeling

i resent my parents for how they reacted,"( tw self harm )

on some level i think i resent my parents. when i was around 12, i was going through a lot of mental health issues and it resulted in me finding online communities surrounding depression and self harm. i dont really remember what drew me to them, but i think i was subconsciously depressed (i had just gone through two cross-state moves in under two years) and felt seen by the people there. it eventually led to me adopting eating disorder behaviors and starting self harm. i think that at the time i didn't fully understand why i liked it. i think it was probably a sense of control that i craved. 

i became accustomed to posting images of my cuts online because that was what i saw other people doing and i enjoyed the attention it gave me. i suppose i wasn't careful enough making sure who followed me because one of my friends from school ended up seeing them and told her mother, who then told my parents. my parents then called me into their room and sat me down and made me tell them everything i was doing. the fasting, the exercising, the cutting, the online community, everything. they made me show them my cuts and my scars. i remember very clearly the way my mother cried and how cold her fingers were on my wrist. i am a bit fuzzy on more of the details, but i think that it was then that they started to freak out. my dad slept on the floor of my room to make sure i didn't kill myself and after that my mom was constantly asking to see my legs and my wrists. when i had new cuts, she would just look at me in this way like she was so disappointed. she would have me bring her my blades under threat of looking for them in my things herself. this continued throughout my middle school years up until high school, which i think is when i got a lot better at hiding it and eventually stopped cutting as much.

my issue is, that feeling of being ""caught,"" of them forcing me to tell them everything and then of being under constant surveillance and constantly being watched has stuck with me for years. i'm 21 now and i still think back to that day. i can still feel the shock and pain of watching my mother cry. i feel that they probably could have handled the situation a lot better, in a way that didn't make me feel like i was getting in trouble for having poor mental health. i have been unable to open up to my parents since then and still find myself hiding things from them. they are clearly trying hard to make themselves seem like they are a place for me to go when i'm hurting, but i don't feel safe or comfortable going to them. i can't just forget the way they treated me when they first found out. i think it makes me hate them, in a way. i feel a bit guilty for feeling this way because i know they were probably reacting how they thought was best and they just wanted me to be safe, but it still hurt me. i feel like i'm hurt. and i don't know if they can do anything to fix that.",princesiddie,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnpnhk/i_resent_my_parents_for_how_they_reacted/

He had a good job at home that he left  and  we were hoping that he would find something fast.

Hes now sitting at home all day, doesnt see a reason to leave bed and lacks all energy to do anything. He struggles to sleep at night. We fight almost daily because he is so frustrated and this is getting us more and more apart.

He has a therapist who helped him before but now seems to not help anymore. He says that all he needs is a job. We went on a holiday the other day and he was back to normal. 

Im not a very emotional person and struggle to put myself in his shoes. I never had this feeling of hopelessness or low energy, so dont really know how it feels. He knows that these are feelings of depression ( had them as a teenager) but is also lost what to do besides finding ajob).

I am trying to be strong but I am so sad. I look at old photos of us and get really upset. I've been lucky most of my life and never had to deal with major health issues for myself or those around me. 

How can I cope with this? Ive never felt this sad in my life.",Blues2305,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tne866/ive_had_anxiety_my_whole_life_but_now_i_am/
The dead end of my life.,"Please read if you have the time. I guess it's not that important, but... I guess TL;DR is that life seems to have destroyed all my hopes to be happy.

I've always tried to be a good person. I've made mistakes like everyone else. But it seems like my life has reached a dead end that seems totally redundant. I'm ready to die. I don't hate myself. In fact, I hope that I die who I am today. I'm a smart guy, who is humble enough to admit when I'm wrong and I try to look at life and morality objectively. I know I'm what could be considered attractive, and I have talent and a good physique. I've been on disability for over four years, partly because I struggle with what many would call schizophrenia. I don't think it's schizophrenia anymore. There was a time when I dismissed audio hallucinations as nothing but hallucinations because I didn't want to be schizophrenic. I didn't want my life to be defined by schizophrenia. I knew what schizophrenia was, and didn't want to allow it to influence my life. I've witnessed things since then that make it undeniable from my perspective that I'm not schizophrenic. I guess that's what a schizo would say, huh?
Growing up I kept lowering my own bar over and over again. When voices and delusional sensations of being spiritually assaulted at work made it impossible for me to hold down my first job, I started trying other lines of work to try to find something that didn't bother me. My first work experience was as a carpenter, and, even though I suffered from hallucinations then, I performed fine, if not above average. By the time I was twenty years old, I had devolved from working at a grocery store, to working as a dishwasher, to working as a tax preparer, to taking temp jobs in a desperate attempt to earn money at all. At one time I wanted to join the air force, but... I neglected the opportunity because I planned on getting married to my highschool sweetheart. She cheated on me repeatedly, and I couldn't just keep giving her second chances. God, I miss the cat we adopted when we were together... He was my baby.

At this point in my life I've tried to kill myself more times than I can count, and constantly fail. From a realistic perspective, the only explanation I have is that somewhere deep down, my schizophrenic self refuses to die, so I lose bodily control during suicide attempts.. I periodically go through attempts to slit my throat even now. I'm 25, and after four years of schizophrenia which takes the form of spiritual impositions coupled with a totally unhinged grasp on reality, I have too much past trauma to ever want to live. The pain I've suffered from at the hands of my ""spiritual"" experience is far beyond repair. I don't expect anything good out of anyone anymore. I don't expect anyone to like me. I'm fucked up emotionally. I used to be a hopeless romantic, but now I feel like I'm unfit to love someone. All my life I wanted devote myself to environmental efforts, and otherwise just wanted to live decently with the woman I loved. I didn't have delusions of grandeur. Instead I have voices haunting me, saying that they're god, or someone who's trapped me in a simulation. Even if I could prove that none of it was real, I'd just want to kill myself anyways. Who could love someone like me? I'm fucking crazy. I'm fucked up inside, and worse yet, I would've fucked myself up on the inside with my own delusions. I don't expect a happy ending. I just want to sleep, once and for all. My health seems to fluctuate widely. Some times it feels like I'm dying from complications from all my past suicide attempts, other times I feel perfectly fine or like my body is healing. This isn't even anything new... I feel like my life has become some sick inescapable game. I can't even find peace in death... I don't want hope... I want out. I want this to be over. I don't care if there's no afterlife. I don't care if I die a loser. I don't care if all I amount to is just another body that is added to the yearly census on deaths by suicide..

I hope there is mercy in my life. I've always tried to do the right thing. I'm not some player, or some user, or junkie, or traitor. I'm not trying to get bitches and cars..

Thanks for reading.. I know I'm going to die alone. I just hope it's sooner rather than later.",SmokingPup,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn8yyx/the_dead_end_of_my_life/

"Short lived highs, sadness, and distractions","When you’ve been sad for so long, it’s easy to believe that that’s all you’ve ever felt and that’s all you’ll ever feel. It makes you forget what happiness feels like. I can only remember two periods in particular where I felt pure joy. They didn’t last very long, not as long as sadness. I’ve grown to believe I will never be happy and all these good times are temporary. When it’s gone, I’ll be left disappointed. That’s why I’m so afraid to be happy sometimes. Not afraid to be happy, but afraid of what comes next. Afraid of having it ripped away from me. Makes me feel let down, disappointed. In the periods of pure sadness, there are a few good moments where I would feel pretty good, but it doesn’t last a significant amount. It could last a couple of moments in a day. To keep from feeling the full weight of my sadness, I tend to distract myself. It provides temporary relief. It’s just that I don’t know how long I can keep going with the temporaries. I can only distract myself for so long. I can’t keep my hopes up and then be disappointed in the end.",greengooberz,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnesdo/short_lived_highs_sadness_and_distractions/
I have not had a good adulthood…,"Beware, this is something I just pumped out while balling by eyes out. Don’t know if there’s typos or anything like that, I only know it’s long as fuck. Here ya go strangers on the internet. 

After high school I went to college. I broke my hand playing football, abused the oxycodone, started flunking my classes, and dropped out of college.
So I came back home to Texas, got a job working at Burnet County Jail. Did that for a few months and started dating a girl. Spent so much time with the girl that I fell asleep during my night shift and falsified paperwork to try to hide it. I was caught, fired, and arrested for Falsification of Government Documents. Looking back I should’ve quit because I wasn’t happy at the job and I don’t regret spending time with the girl.
So I continue to see this girl and life is good. She even manages to accidentally get me a job interview for Tractor Supply. She even moves in with me.
Then my truck gets crashed. Had to fix that. She gets sick and can’t work so I support us. Then she quits her job. I pick up another job to try to support us until she can get another. That truck no longer works so I have to use my dad’s. She eventually gets lined up to work at the Hughs Unit prison in Gatesville. All the while family drama is happening because the house is FULL with my family at this point.
I quit one of my jobs now that we can support each other. Life is really good for a while.
She are happy despite everything. She gets pregnant I’m overjoyed. My beautiful baby boy, Atlas Benjamin Calkins. I promised I would be a good father and husband. So we got married. I get lined up for a new job at Clements/Parsons Elementary. And we’re getting close to moving into a house of our own.
Then everything changed. On the morning of November 28th, 2020 she was in a horrible car accident. I got the call while I was driving to work that morning. I had been calling and calling over and over to try to make sure she got home ok. I got a call back from a paramedic and he told me what happened. He told me to go to a hospital in Killeen. So I drive there and wait. And I wait. I wait until they finally tell me that she is at a different hospital.
I start racing to Temple, getting a call from her doctor while driving telling me what to do once I get there and trying to ask me questions. I finally get there and sit in the ER waiting room. More waiting. I’m eventually taken to a private waiting room. A doctor comes in a little later to tell me everything. She was in surgery. All they knew for certain at that point was that she had broken her femur. He told me to have hope that Atlas survived. I appreciate him doing everything he could to save my wife… but I resent him for giving me that false hope. I sat in that small room fluctuating between “Are my wife and son dead?” to “is my wife dead and I have to raise my son alone?” to “is my wife going to make it but we lost Atlas?” to “will they both make it and we’ll be celebrating an early birthday for him?”. I would soon get my answer. He was gone. I was devastated. I wanted to burn the world. To destroy everything I could see. But I had no energy, so I just sat there. Paralyzed. Watching my world crumble while I couldn’t do anything to stop it.
I knew I had to be with my wife. When she was finally stable I was able to sit with her. She was still asleep, and whenever she did wake up she was too delirious to comprehend anything. I watched as her body struggled. Intubated and covered in scratches and bruises. The biggest thing that hit me was the emptiness under the blanket where Atlas always was. The huge baby bump.. gone. Family and friends came. She could only have one visitor at a time because of Covid regulations so I had to pull myself away so that others could see her. They asked me if I wanted to see Atlas. I made sure that nobody would see him until my wife was awake and we could see him together. I stayed day and night. She woke up. And I had to tell her that Atlas was gone. We cried so hard. She was still intubated so she couldn’t speak still. The moment they brought Atlas into the room I almost threw up. I was shaking and crying so hard. Seeing my wife hold him should’ve been a beautiful sight and one I had been looking forward to for months. But there was no joy here. Only heartbreak and death. I held his cold limp body in my hands and my mind raced through all of the moments that would never come. We had him cremated. I was against any splitting of his ashes for jewelry or anything wrong like that. It felt disgusting. 
My wife started her recovery process, pushing herself far harder than she probably should have. Before I knew it we were out of the hospital and back home. I was always there, taking care of her and helping her with anything she needed. There was only one small spark of joy and love left in the world and I was going to hold onto her with everything I had.
Time came for me to start my new job at the Elementary School. Every day I died inside. Being around those wonderful kids broke my heart and reminded me of everything I had lost.  I found myself making excuses just so I could go cry my heart out away from the kids.
I still loved those awesome kids. I tried my hardest to treat them like I imagined I would treat Atlas. And then we moved into our new place. We had so much help from family and friends. We began the process of truly trying to pick up the pieces of our life. 
I tried so hard to support us and take care of the house and my wife. Thankfully we had support from family and friends to help us get by. I regret that I’m horrible at house work. I really did try. But I failed. And failed. 
Slowly life started to become more secure. She eventually stated work again. She struggled and I tried my hardest to try to support her and make sure she had everything she needed. But I still failed around the house. 
Then I got a call telling me that I have Court. After all this time I’m finally dealing with the charges from my job at the Jail. I go through the process and and am put on probation for a year. Now I can’t start throwing my money at the fines and fees associated with that along with giving my wife any money she needed to help with bills. But I pushed onward.
We started to try to build a shed. That failed because of my incompetence. I let the house become a disaster. I didn’t do enough to fix it. I was failing at being a husband. I was slowly killing my marriage, but I didn’t realize it at the time…
Then I get fired from my job. A kid threw a tantrum and I was told there was a mark left on his arm while I was trying to calm him down. I was fired the same day. Agin everything I was trying to to was crumbling because I wasn’t good enough. Because I had failed.
So I try to find a new job while she supports us.
I find a nice job at Alta Loma, a mental health and addiction recovery center. It’s a good job and I still work there. 
My wife is working so many hours. The prison is majorly understaffed and she’s being forced to work outrageous hours for a pay half of what she deserves. It’s because of these hours that she crashed in the first place. And now it was putting extra strain on our marriage. Between her job and my inadequacy, our marriage was dying. 
She was constantly telling me “You need therapy"" and “we both need therapy” but I didn’t think I needed it. I was still sad about Atlas but I had come to terms with his death. But I didn’t realize that when she said “we both need therapy” she meant “we need therapy”. I didn’t realize until it was too late. It was during this time that I made my biggest mistake yet. The anvil that broke the camel’s back. I’ll leave it out due to privacy reasons. But it wasn’t infidelity or anything like that. Just a misunderstanding that shattered the cracked window. And again. I didn’t know this until much later.
We hadn’t been sleeping in the same room for a while. She told me because it was dirty, but she eventually told me the truth. She was afraid of me. She finally let everything out and told me everything. I was mortified at myself. I tried every day to make up for what I had done. She was so distant from me. I tried giving her space and anything else I could think of. But nothing worked.
And then our landlord told us that our lease would not be renewed and we had to get out. Fun. So we made arrangements to move in with her dad. We got a storage unit for our things and we moved in.
I slept on the couch/recliner. Alternating between the two whenever my back started to hurt too much from one or the other. I kept trying to fix things. Even letting myself believe that things might slowly be getting better. But it wasn’t true. Everything was wrong. She told me that she just didn’t care. About me or anything I did. I was nothing. She didn’t love me. I was just there. My heart was truly broken for the second time.
I kept trying though. I even tried therapy. But everything I did was nothing. None of it mattered. She was done. 
Then came the day she told me to pack my shit as she got into a friends truck to go to work. I had a panic attack like nothing I’d ever dealt before. The world was so wrong. I cried and screamed and threw up and begged God for any help. Anything to fix this. No answer came. I called work to tell them I couldn’t come in that night. I still feel bad for crying so loud over the phone. I called my parents to finally tell them everything and that I had to stay with them. Everything was truly wrong.
Every day she posts several things. Almost all of them hurt me and tear at my soul. I try to text her to try to talk to her. She says very mean things. She even blocked me because I was bothering her. I tried to keep fighting even then. The day she gave to ring back to me, she dropped it into my palm like she was letting go of something that was burning her. Finally glad to be rid of something that was causing her so much pain. We talked to my parents because they asked us to and she agreed to a separation with the promise to work on ourselves and slowly try to work on each other.
I was given that same false hope I felt back in the hospital. She later told me that she only agreed out of respect to my parents. That once she walks through the door she’s not turning back. I don’t know if I have any fight left or if I even should. She’s hurt me so much. Said so many things. I want to hate her for everything that’s going on. I want to blame her for anything. But I can’t. I did this. I let it fall apart. As much as people say it was both of us, I just don’t see it.
I love her so much. I want to stop. To be able to turn it off. But no matter what I do I still have this undying raging love for her, my moonlight.

And that brings us to now. My life is really something. I have my birthday coming up in a few days. Turning 22. Yay. I try to look forward to things in the future so I don’t end up looking down the barrel of a gun today.",CopperasCove1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnjk0m/i_have_not_had_a_good_adulthood/

Lamictal and Cannabis Interactions (cant get high),"Hey gang,

&amp;#x200B;

Obv a throwaway account, dont want to put my mental health out there for the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed bi-polar/Manic Depressive. I began wellbutrin about 5 months ago. About 3 months ago I started taking Lamictal ( a mood stabilizer). You have to ramp up on Lamical, because there is small chance of some nasty side-effects (do not google it. I have warned you)

&amp;#x200B;

So I started on 25mg or 50mg of Lamictal. I ramped up to land at 100mg a day and also a 150mg of Wellbutrin.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a one-hit-chump. One good hit of some concentrate would keep my high for 1/2 the day. The first 20-45 mins I would be ""too high"" until it settled in a bit. I also got the terribly feared anxiety that often comes with cannabis usage.

&amp;#x200B;

Since a regular 100mg a day of Lamictal I can no long get high like I use to. First of all I am dabbing the shit out of concentrate these days. 1 gram of concentrate use to last me weeks if not a couple months. Now I can dab a whole g in a weekend...maybe even a night if I tried. All the while never getting as high as I was. This is not a totally bad effect for me. I like the subtle high I am getting now. My main personal concern is how much more expensive staying medicated is now. I am in a medically legal state in the U.S. and shit is expensiveeee. We have no recreational program yet. so prices stay high. I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a tolerance issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I have googled the hell out of this question and the internet doesnt mention this idea anywhere. i have looked up interactions and side effects. I have searched for peoples specific answers to Lamictal and Cannabis interactions. Most of those accounts say that Cannabis will make you sleepy with Lamictal. that is not my only experience here.

&amp;#x200B;

Im interested in hearing anyone's first or second hand account. Anyone out there taking Lamitcal know WTF I am talking about? Anyone get noticeably less high with a Lamictal script?

&amp;#x200B;

I intend to cross post this in as many cannabis/mental health subreddits as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. - If anyone knows of any other good subreddits that might help me, please do suggest them and I will cross post.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you one and all ahead of time for all your real input, just not the guy yelling ""tolerance broooo!""",throwawayelevendy,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnmvqt/lamictal_and_cannabis_interactions_cant_get_high/
Flash Forwards,"Sometimes I have vivid flashes of scenes where I've committed the s word. They flash in my mind randomly, even when I think I'm doing good or doing okay. Even when I think I'm finally content or happy, poof, just a quick flash of me doing something crazy. I was walking on a balcony yesterday and I wasn't feeling the best emotionally, but i was okay. And poof, a quick flash of me hanging myself off the side. It was scary because I didn't even think my mind was in that place. I had to stop walking for a moment to make sure I didn't do anything stupid without thinking. And I've been suicidal before, but I didn't want that at that moment. Has something like this happened to anyone else? it happened again a moment ago.

Job opportunity didn’t work out like I had planned which caused my immediate life plans (wife, house, kids)  to change. Tried getting a professional career in the same industry only to get passed over time and time again. Getting passed over by people who were less qualified and experienced, sucked the passion for my career right out of my soul. 

GF broke my heart and I forgave her because of what she told me. Only to find out a year later that even that was a lie and it was more then what it was, after I proposed. I love her to death and would literally do anything on planet earth to make her happy, but the lying hurt so fucking much. Safe to say that shit made me feel inadequate as fuck and caused some extreme paranoia. Lost 2 of our dogs in under a year, lost a house I really liked in a town I really loved. Lost my grandfather who was a best friend to me and couldn’t even be there with him because of fucking covid. Felt sad and guilty I couldn’t see him in the end when I wanted to see him the most. Started my own business which is having some success, but no one really appreciates what I do nor do they understand the work that goes into it. I don’t really care to tell people the toll it puts on me mentally and physically because no one I know really cares, don’t know why they would. I can’t focus on shit and I feel fucking broken and sometimes lifeless. I don’t care to answer text or business emails because I’m so burnt out . If I do it just means more work which means more of a toll. If I don’t, I don’t make money and feel fucking useless. 

My mind, ego, pride and heart have all been broken in under 3 years.  I feel like I have no support and feel like a bitch for feeling this way. I don’t ever put my problems on anyone, I’m usually picking up people and helping them with their issues. Lately, small issues have been causing me to spiral my thoughts and makes me remember the last few years and sink back into a depression. I have more loses in life then I do wins and it kills me. I feel like I’ve lost connections with people over the years because of the career path I choose and the physical distance that’s between me and my old support system. 

Financially, I’m fine now, but with the economy going the way it’s going I fear that could all change. I’ve already lost 3 clients with slim prospects. People want my service, but don’t want to pay me (go figure). I don’t have the energy or the time I want to have to go campaign for more work, but I’m so fucking burnt out I couldn’t do it even if I did. My wife makes good money, but it kills me that I can’t provide the way I want to. She’s put up with following me around chasing my goals that she deserves to have anything and everything she wants. I can’t give it to her right now which makes me not blame her for seeking attention else where. She can’t hustle her ass off, she doesn’t need me. 

There’s a laundry list of other things that would just fuck me up even more if I sat here and typed them out, but I just needed to vent. I don’t have any close friends that know the real me and who have known me before I switched my tone. Im definitely cut from a different cloth then the people that are around me, which makes it hard to connect with anyone for more than 5 minutes if they aren’t paying me to be there. Even my wife wouldn’t really understand who I was before. I don’t even think I could show her or explain it now because I’m feeling old as fuck these days. I feel like a failure in her eyes when I compare myself to the guys that I know and she knows. I don’t blame her if she thought the same. Who the fuck wants to be with someone like me? - shit, I wouldn’t. 

I feel I don’t get the respect I deserve from the people that should be giving it, but they honestly don’t know what I’ve been through. This weight that’s on my shoulders is getting real fucking heavy and I don’t know what to do with it. Someone is gonna say something to me that’s gonna make me go ape shit or I’m just gonna pile it on and eventually collapse.",fresh510,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tngo2f/straight_up_depressed/

How to approach my seriously depressed brother?,"**TLDR: My brother is seriously depressed, does not leave his room in his shared flat, and stopped answering calls and messages from anyone. How to approach him when I visit him without an invitation?**

My brother has a history of depression (approx. 5 years from 20-25) including suicide attempts that led to drug and alcohol abuse. He managed to overcome it somehow and was able to build a new life studying in a new city, finding lots of friends, doing sport and finding a girlfriend. He is close to finishing his studies but now the girl broke up and this sent him in a spiral downhill. Two months after the breakup he barely leaves the room, doesn't even play computer games, but mainly just lays in bed not doing anything. He was still responding to messages and phone calls a week ago but now this has all stopped since a week. I know from his flatmate that he still sometimes eats in the night, that's all. I now want to drive down and be there for him, but I have no idea how to talk to him. I am sure he won't respond to the door, so I asked the flatmate and he is willing to open the door for me. But I am scared that my brother sees this as a breach of privacy and will respond aggressively. But I could never forgive myself for losing him to suicide without taking action.",FrequentCut,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnl360/how_to_approach_my_seriously_depressed_brother/

Why Do People Have To Be So Fucking Horrible?!?!?!?!,"It's partly my fault, a voice in my head said not to leave a comment on this video and I usually listen, but this time I didn't. I've suffered from depression, suicidal thoughts, due to how shit my life is. I'm not living, I just exists and I wish I had never been born! I've been weak my entire life and no matter how hard I try, I just keep failing...



It was a controversial topic in the video and I'm not even comfortable saying what it was, because knowing my luck, assholes who roam the internet looking for people to shit on will find this post! And what's so stupid is I said I could understand both sides of the argument. Basically, I feel worthless after seeing their replies...



I hate how fucking horrible people can be. They don't think how what they say and do affects other people. And even when I feel strongly about something, I'm very careful with my words because I know what it feels like and I don't wish to cause other people emotional/mental harm! There are better ways to word things even when someone disagrees or maybe right. I'm probably being a bit dramatic, but I just feel like I got cornered by bullies and beaten to a pulp...



Because of this kind of crap I've had to deal with most of my life, it has closed me off from everyone. I can't trust anymore. I can't open up or be honest because I'm either shit on or made fun of.

Don’t even know who I am anymore,"Over the past seven years I have been through absolute hell. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it really so I guess I’ll just vent here to total strangers. I left for the military and my kids stayed with my ex. Some really terrible stuff happened to them while I was gone. I came home to sort it all out and it turned into an absolute nightmare. They were removed from my ex’s home and place into state custody until we could figure some things out. Turns out there was a ton of domestic abuse in her home and it came down on my kids and some even worse things happened to them. I spare you the details. There was whole lot of court and the kids end up with me. I am remarried and now have other children as well. I can’t shake the fact that all of this happened. I’m literally dying inside so badly that it’s effecting my marriage. My wife is strong and she has put up with some un godly shit from my ex. Then she has to put up with me who is now just a shell of my former self. I can’t explain to you all in words on how hard this has all been. It’s been 7 years and I’m not longer the happen person I once was. My kids are all safe now and happy and don’t really remember any of the stuff that happened to them and have been in therapy now for years which I attend with them to help them with what they do remember. The things I heard have hurt me more than anything I saw in the military. I can’t shake the description of the things they told me and I don’t think I ever will. I work 40 hour weeks and I’m home three days a week helping with home things and homework and bed and nap times and I know I am extremely lucky to have my children all under one roof now but I cannot trust anyone anymore. I don’t want to go out on couples dates, or be in large groups of people I just hate it. I can’t stand it. My wife’s a social butterfly and I’m just not there mentally anymore. I hurt so bad inside that I can’t even cry anymore. I was told by the girls theripist that I won’t ever be able to speak my about my trauma because it won’t help them at all. If you’ve never sat in room wailing to your wife that all you want to do is see your kids and felt absolutely helpless to be able to help them, you are so lucky. I’m emotionally gone and angry a lot. Never ever violent, just so mad that this happened at all. I have no outlet and have recently reached out to a theripist to speak to because, I am in now way going to hurt myself or anything like that but I need help trying to get over all of this and get my life back. I want to sing with my wife and dance with her in the kitchen and just feel alive again but I just can’t. For fucks sake I want to cry until I fall asleep but I just can’t. I physically can’t bring myself to do it. I hope that none of you Ever have to feel this way and I wish that I could hug you all and tell you that it will all be alright and make it all better for you, even if I can’t make it better for myself.

Extensive list of things I do to improve my mental health,"This list will start from most important to the least important , some  things are anecdotal and up to you but I will try to be as descriptive as possible so that I don't come off as somebody that just wants to virtue signal or being a know it all asshole

I Get a diagnosis , Nothing worse than not knowing . You start creating scenario's in you head and you are making the problem worse. You are allowed to get a second or third opinion if you don't feel comfortable. Not all Psychiatrist and Psychologist are the same and their methods differ.

II IF you are prescribed medication don't stop using it unless told other wise by your medical professional. You think you are okay on the medication and this gives a false sense of your medical state.  Yet again speak with your medical professional about this and he\\she will give an accurate estimate. Listen to them rather than yourself . Remember you head is not working correctly so why trust it in the first place?

III I understand that some people cant afford medical treatment but don't resent yourself for it . I was in the same boat . IF you can the do it then I recommend doing it but if you cant then you can try some things I am talking about. Medication makes it easier but it's still possible without it, in my opinion. 

IV get that body moving ,  I do it via exercise ,cardio and body weight .I do it for free and from my home . try to do it at least 2-3 times  a week . half an hour at a time but it does not need to be in the traditional way and most importantly it should be something that you more or less enjoy. No use doing something you hate because the idea is to continue doing it.  Exercise will release endorphins that will help . it helped me in any event . 

V Try to cut out junk food and cook your own meals or if you have to buy premade meals try the healthier option at least .  Sugar is basically poison for your liver and can have detrimental affects on your body and by proxy your mental state .  not saying its going to cure you but at least it wont add to your issues . One less problem right ? 

VI recreational drugs don't mix with prescription medication. This can screw you up even more .  I understand why people do it but its not useful and in actual fact it takes you down a spiral. Just try to avoid it if possible.

VII Try to the best of your ability to cut out everything that is toxic in your life.  Some we have a choice , social media , shitty friends and so forth but some is more difficult like family , spouses and your job. That is up to you how you are going to do it .  Not always possible to quit your job and to be honest you are going to have that ,regardless. It does not matter which job but some jobs are worse than others so I do understand.  Personally for me it was social media . I use it very infrequently now and it helped a lot .  Comparing yourself to a fake person or a fake reality will always make you depressed and resentful .  Yes they are lying to you and you are trying to imitate a lie?  not very useful.

VIII Be the best you that you can be .  Unfortunately I only figured it out very late in my life . It almost feels like its too late but I made peace with it and at this stage the only thing I can do is, try .   I am going back to school , don't know if its going to help but its better to try and fail than to not try at all . Some of you may say that I am just wasting my time and statistically I am screwed but you cant say that with 100% certainty .  The rule of probability says that if I stay in my house , statistically nothing will happen , Like a black hole but if I go out and try my odds go up. Yes the odds are low but its better than nothing. Just try your best because then at least you can give life the big middle finger and say I tried mf and that is something nobody can take away from you .

Lastly, You are not alone when you ask yourself ,what is the point of life? This has  been asked since man could think for itself and the answer is , we don't know but that does not mean life is pointless. We create our own reality within the macro one and that is fine.  Give yourself a break and try to follow your gut . Your brain has been programmed and can be deprogrammed .  Read books or watch things that gives you perspective. Popular content is enjoyable but does not really give you perspective. Its like junk food.   Perspective is very important in life and in general .

This was a long one and I commend you for reading it if you did and to all I say this.

before i graduated early this year, i went to three different high schools. i was able to make friends my first two years but then i wasn’t able to in my other two schools. i was okay with being alone but for some reason, this loneliness stung me. i think it was because i didn’t have anyone, especially moving to a city. i didn’t have my best friend that i could talk to all the time, i didn’t have my other friends and i feel like i left everything in the dust. but i know that if i go back to my home town, i would feel even more miserable (because let’s just say, my dad isn’t a big fan of me). i did everything i could go make myself happy and some stuff did work, others didn’t. i got a job and i was doing so much for my community. i thought that if i accomplished some of the things i wanted to do in life, i would feel better about myself. but i hate how temporary that was. 

recently, i’ve gotten some college decisions back and i feel like a failure. i worked so hard for the four years of my life and it feels like it went to absolutely nothing. i’m sure i will get over that very soon but i’m not sure what to do next. i’ve waited so long but i’m so disappointed in myself. i tried so hard and yet i didn’t make it. i tried talking to my family but they pushed it off aside. i’m not saying that they don’t care but they just pushed me aside. whats so hard is that they knew how much it mattered to me. yet it feels like maybe they don’t actually care. but i cant say that. i am the first girl who would be going to college in my family so i don’t think they understand how it feels. i cant put the blame on them but myself.

as i am typing some of this, i think maybe i’m worried about my future. i feel stuck. i just cant believe i set myself all these standards of myself, thinking that whatever i did was possible. or maybe im just stupid, i’m not sure. everything feels uncertain and everything is moving too fast.",Ok_Employer_9171,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tndhhb/i_think_i_am_a_failure/
I feel like I can't get over my past.,"My depression and issues I have today stems from my parents and how I was raised. In the past, my mom tried to hide me from having deep friendships with people and was verbally and mentally abusive. She is mostly better now, and acts normal. But in the past she and my father took out their issues with each other and made me their therapist. However, some things happened and I suffered from seasonal depression and had dreams of moving out of state so I don't have to suffer from it anymore. However, I was gaslit to staying where I lived because of my parents, and as a result, fell to alcoholism and severe depression. It sucked because I had no support from both parents and my father was the one who kept pushing me to drink. My mother found out I was drunk once, and said she would throw me out if I did it again. So I hid my drinking, and depression. Both of my parents are fine now, but I can't help but have resentment.",Kawaiimera,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnifcx/i_feel_like_i_cant_get_over_my_past/

i feel lost,"hey everybody…i’m not entirely sure where to post so i just decided to put something here. i’ve been feeling really down lately again and just feel so lost and have no clue what i’m supposed to do.

so a little backstory: i got kicked out of my house back in march of 2021, our landlords illegally kicked us out and since then i have moved 6 times. around july my manager said that i could move into her basement w my roommate bc we both had nowhere to go and we were sharing my childhood bedroom at my grandparents w 3 small dogs. me and my manager had so many plans on what to do w the basement to make it more livable and nice and not so depressing bc it was an unfinished basement. but my roommate had decided to just half ass move all our stuff in one day and then after that day gave up on trying to set stuff up. i was working damn near 60 hrs a week working splits trying to save up money to get an apartment or something so i was just exhausted and needed help w cleaning and keeping the basement not looking like a damn pigsty. we started getting into a lot of arguments bc she was so bad at communication and not really helping out w anything. then around october her ex that had ghosted her randomly messaged her again and they started hanging out ALL. THE. TIME. like she was never home anymore and i got stuck having to watch/take care of her 2 dogs and my dog and keep the basement clean and go to work full time. she started not coming home even if she told me she’d be home that night so i’d stay up to let her in bc our door automatically locked and she had lost her key within a week of us living there. i knew that she was staying around her ex a lot, and while i don’t really care about that (even tho she did have a bf that was in jail at the time) i was more annoyed that she wud tell me she’d be home at a certain or she was on her way home but then come 3am she’s still not home. id call her or text her and she wud just leave me on read and then say “oh i forgot”. that went on for about 2 months and she ended up moving out in november. however she didn’t tell me she was moving out when she did, and she slowly was moving stuff over to her friends (not ex bf) place so i wouldn’t notice. i had told her before that the day she moved out is she has to find somewhere for the dogs cuz i was not willing to keep them if she couldn’t take them. the only way that i’d be willing to keep them was if she had already had a place for them to go but they couldn’t have them until a specified date after she herself moved out. i ended up finding out that she completely moved out while i was at work, not from her but from one of my managers. i had worked an entire shift w her and she said not a single word to me. i get home and one of her dogs was still there, so i called her and said that if she was no longer staying she has to come get her dog. when she had left the basement was absolutely disgusting and she refused to help clean it and said that she doesn’t live there anymore. now i got extremely depressed while living in the basement by myself. it was disgusting, i had a shitty job i hated, i was exhausted, and i had no car. i ended up attempting suicide and one of my roommates found my unconscious in the bathroom. i went to the hospital for a week and when i got out my roommates were so mean to me. come to find out that my ex roommate didn’t tell me that one of her dogs had fleas and she saw them before she left. so when i got out of the hospital the basement was INFESTED w them. so i do understand now why they were so upset, we’ll at least one of the roommates anyways.

while i was in the hospital my mom had begged me to move back to iowa (i was living in wisconsin at the time) and had promised me that i would get help. like w a car, getting to appts, getting to a job, help getting my own place. of course while i was in the hospital i had said yes bc i was so desperate for help and didn’t know what else to do. i ended up moving on the first of the yr so hopeful and sure that i was gonna make it. 

now cut too 3 months later and i don’t have a job, i have no way to get to a job even if i applied to one, absolutely no income, and living in my sisters stepmoms house. i have no friends here and no social life at all. my sister had gotten kicked out a week ago and i’m still here. my mom was gonna move me into her place and even tho i wasn’t exactly thrilled about moving there i was gonna do it. but i still wasn’t happy, i just missed all my friends back home and just wanted to go back. but i knew i couldn’t and that it probably wouldn’t help if i did bc i have been moving back and forth between iowa and wisconsin practically my entire life. my childhood best friend knew all this so she had offered me to move to indiana this summer w her, her bf and her almost 2yr old daughter. bc i haven’t seen her in so long and she has been telling me that her relationship was great and she made it seem moving to indiana was a safe and easy option and we just had to get accepted to a place and we could the move. she even told me to talk to my mom and family about it all. so i did, i told my mom the plan, said everything that my best friend was telling me and my mom was upset of course, but she said that it seemed to be a good choice. well literally an hr after telling my best friend that i had just told all my family and everything, she decides to throw a bombshell at me and say it’s not exactly as she made it seem. she’s scared in her relationship and is desperately trying to get out of it and she’s not 100% sure how we’re even going to manage this. i’m pissed bc i just turned down my moms offer to move in, where i would have had access to getting a job and the bus so i could go places and i could then save up to get my own place. and now i’m right back where i was before and idk what to do. it’s embarrassing. and i’m to scared to let my mom know what has just come about cuz it was just yesterday that i was assuring her that i wud be fine. i have no fucking clue what i’m supposed to do and my mental health has already been declining i’m scared what’s gonna happen now. 

i’m sorry for such a long post i just have really needed to vent, if you’ve actually made it this far thank you",Few_Strawberry5863,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tndb81/i_feel_lost/
I think I've Stockholm Syndrome with my Depression,"
I've been with depression pretty much my whole life. I've hardly felt the other way around. I never had any real friends. Depression, my childhood traumas, loneliness were very normalised with me from the beginning so i never questioned it at all until i had started to have some severe symptoms which interrupted  my daily life and eventually got diagnosed with PTSD, MDD and BPD. The first time i started medication i just felt lost and had a really hard time to understand my emotions. But soon enough i adapted and got into my usual self. Meaning the medication didn’t work. This kept happening everytime i changed medication. But It was a product of my effort. Though it didn’t happen in my conscious mind, it just happened. May be It's my defence mechanism to the sudden change. I'm afraid of changes, the moment I'd feel any changes happening I'd just crawl back to my dark empty cave where i feel the most comfortable. Actually I just feel this void inside me without depression. Depression is like this long known old friend. I'm not me without it. I experience things, feel my existence this way. It's how i feel the blue sky, the clouds, a piece of art or a beautiful object. These depressing melancholic feelings, such feelings of homesickness, I'm not me without these feelings. It has been with me for so long that it has become a part of my sentience. I'm someone else without it.
I just want to feel safe. And It's exhausting. I'm always afraid I'll lose myself. My real self. I'm constantly worried about becoming someone else who isn’t me. I absolutely hate this feeling of feeling lost. I hate it. Just hate it. I hate these depressing ugly feelings as well. But i cannot live without them now. I hate this confliction. I think I'm finally going insane.",it_was_a_vivid_dream,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmhna6/i_think_ive_stockholm_syndrome_with_my_depression/
Daily dose of sunshine,"Weather has been nice lately, and on my way to work there is a nice park with a little lake. So I go earlier to work and sit on a bench there so soak up some sun. I think it is helping a bit. Waking is still the hardest thing, that feeling that hits you as you regain consciousness, but this is something I look forward to a little bit now. 


My depression is not as bad some of what I read here. I even hope it it will go away completely one day. Its better now, even thou I still can’t eat. I’m trying to see if I can muster the strength to use this situation as a growing experience. Not that it is easy.

I’d like to think there is a reason for the pain. My mom once said that one grow in life only thru pain. And she was one the happiest and positive person I’ve know, even thou her life was very hard.

So I’m coming up with plans to study philosophy and religion and see if something clicks.

Anyway, this got off tanget, but yeah, try some sun therapy if you can, even if you feel like you hate the sun, as I did when it hit.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. About a month ago, I opened up to my therapist more than I ever had about my Suicidal thoughts. She tried to throw me into a mental ward. My mom tried to convince me to agree with it and go into the ward, but I managed to talk her out of it.

 I've been lying to my therapist since then, trying to put on a facade of steadily getting better. Truth is, I feel like shit. I don't want to be here anymore, but there's no way in hell I'm going into a ward. My pills don't work, school sucks, I don't have friends, I'm disgusting, and I'm constantly thinking of my ex.

Over a decade of depression... Gone?,"My family has a full line of mental illness, so when I started experiencing depression and anxiety as young as 7 years old I assumed it was all genetically bound to me. 

I'm 23... And, it's gone... It's quiet. For the first time in my life...? 

My depression has always been another train of thought. I've always described it like the ""USB symbol"" like there's 3 prongs of logical, normal, and depression just always going in my brain like a tired pessimistic critic of everything. 

I've just learned to ignore it as much as possible. I always listen to podcasts or videos that prevents it from getting louder. The exhaustion was the only thing that actually affected my life. 

But. I was just thinking today, I haven't had that other train of thought in... A little while.. Like it's just, gone. And I think, it's because I'm happy...? 

Sure my life has been stressful but. Was that much of my life in that bad of an environment? Like, I thought I was meant to be like that forever, as far as I can remember I've been like this... What, what the hell? Why is it just, gone???

A lot of things in my life have changed within the last year. I literally dropped everything, was at my lowest, and somehow built myself back up to an even better position than before... 

I'm not even sure that I'm happy. Maybe, peaceful is the best way to word it. Comfortable. And without even realizing, I don't think that train of thought is there anymore... 

Don't get me wrong. I'm still trying to get help for my other mental illnesses. But I think, the suicidal thoughts are gone. And, that's, fucking awesome... 

I really hope that you can find your peace... 
If I can offer advice at all. It's, if you hate your life, don't end it in the way you think you should... if you're ready to give up everything, do it. If you're ready to end your life, demand the best from your job. 
If they deny you a raise, fuck it, you were ready to lose the job anyway. Quit/get fired. 
Hate your romantic partner, get rid of them. You were ready to let go of them with ending your life anyway. 
Family? Respect my boundries or gtfo of my life.
Home life suck? Go somewhere else. Can't afford it? Try crashing somewhere and figure out the long term plan after. 

If you're miserable in your life, let everything go, and try something completely new. The worst that happens, is you're in a shitty situation somewhere else. But you'll never be happy where you are right now.

I left my ex, moved in with parents, demanded more from my job and had my two weeks ready. All because I told myself if I couldnt kms then I would ruin my life another way. And it all worked for the best. 

I got a promotion, which let me meet someone, and we have our own home. Financially I'm not drowning anymore. I'm so, so thankful I quit my life in a different way. 

I guess I'm doing this long message because there's no one in my life that would get this. I was talking to my partner and they said it's good but. I guess I'm in shock that it's not there, but. Also feel like I need to throw a God damn party for this?? Haha. Uh... Thank you, to anyone who reads this. I really hope that this makes some people think that there's a light out there. And not that I'm doing some vague ass inspirational quote thing. That I can offer something raw and honest.. 

I hope you find your peace.",ChrisHansen6969,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tncen7/over_a_decade_of_depression_gone/
I feel ill,"Every waking moment I am sick, I have an aura of darkness surrounding me constantly. Sure, I can ignore it and distract myself with whatever activity, but once I turn inward I always discover the same disease rotting me away.

I have no motivation in college, I’m falling behind drastically. I hate my job, but stay because it pays well. I’ve let myself get distanced from friends I’ve had since kindergarten. I’m in a relationship I’ve lost love for, and I continue to lead on this wonderful girl, who deserves far better, because I don’t have the courage to leave. I’m even falling back into my drug addiction, amphetamine is constantly pumping through my views.

Now on top of all this, for almost 4 years now, I don’t even know what my fucking gender is?! I hate I was born a man, that I can say plainly, but for some reason I continue to stop myself from pursuing a change. Is it the shame I feel? Am I scared of the effort it will take? Is it because I feel like a freak, like a fucking clown?

It kills me, whenever I think about it, that I did not transition years earlier. I just want to present as a convincing woman. I could have done that earlier, but now? 

For the first time in a year, I’ve stopped suppressing all this and had a good conversation with a friend I trust. But why do I feel embarrassed, why do I feel humiliated and degraded? Why do I feel so broken and alone?

I hate having to fake a smile so I’ve started to stop myself from faking it. Instead I’ll be my real depressed self to some extent, but knowing that other will be aware of my low mood is something I very much dislike. I feel as if everyone all find out that I’m not okay, yeah I’m still surviving. The other day I was around my friends and I was extremely tired of faking a smile for them like I always do, so I decided to not fake it this time. This was a big mistake. Everyone was aware of how low my mood was and kept asking about why I liked sad. They believed it was just because I was tried and in some way they were right. I feel really bad for bringing down the mood, but every time I would try to smile it looked so fake and I mean that in an obvious. Kinda like I couldn’t even fake it anymore not just because I was so tired of doing it but because I physically couldn’t do it anymore. I have to go back to faking it now and try my best to make sure they don’t see it again because if they do I know they will be very concerned.

even alcohol is not helping anymore,"I feel so broken, like nothing else is making me happy or care to live anymore. It's like I'm just aimlessly floating. I've always felt disconnected from everything. I'm a huge introvert with no friends. Self esteem is non existant too.

I don't know what to do about a close friend.,"I don't know if this post is a cry for help or just to write down some thoughts. This post is not about me, its about a very close friend.

I'm gonna start at the beginning. I'm working during the day and my dog is home alone. My dog is not used to being alone for a long time and is barking the whole time. My neighbour (the person this post is about) has a heart for animals and is generally the most kind person I know. She offers to take care of my dog during the day where I'm at work. Since I was searching for a solution I gladly accepted this offer and went on. This was about 2 months ago.

We got closer and closer and I began to spend my whole freetime with her. We both seemed to really enjoy. She began to tell me more about her life and about her depression. I shouldn't give out too much details, but she had several suicide attempts and her whole arm is full of self-harm scars. She also told me that life for her is a constant suffering and that she cannot feel anything but a deep sense of emptiness because of the medication she takes. Her life was basically full of traumatic events (childhood, relationships, anxiety).

I was never depressed and never had a strong urge to kill myself, that's why I didn't knew how to handle the situation. I ended up listening to everything she said, assuring her that I was there for her. (Looking at this afterwards, seems like the best thing I could have done)

The days went by and I did my best to help her as much as I could. At first everything seemed fine and she even seemed to be getting a little better, but recently she found out that one of her ""closest friends"" had been lying to her the whole time.

This was kind of the killing blow. It all went down after that. The last 3 days she wanted to kill herself and I managed to talk her out of it. I really don't know what to do. I have this constant feeling of losing her. She told me that I'm the only person she likes in this world and she tried to explain to me that living with constant fear is not worth living. I can't take this. I can't just let her go like this. Again I'm at the edge of crying by writing this post. The fear of losing her and not being able to do anything against it makes me feel so bad.

I'm enjoying every second I spent with her and all I want is to make her feel better. She doesn't think it will ever get better and why not end it right now. I don't want to alert any authorities or anything, because she needs to decide it for herself, all I can do is tell her how much I love her and that I'm there for her if she needs anything.

Thank you for reading this post. I apologize if this post is a bit messy, I was just trying to write down some of my thoughts. I wrote her a message 3 hours ago and she hasn't answered since.

I’ve never travelled, never been more than about 5-6 hour drive away from my hometown. No friends, no girlfriend. I think I’m decent looking but I haven’t been able to talk to any girls since my last girlfriend and I broke up 8 months ago. Horny, tired and depressed all the time. Life is so great lol. I know it could be worse but that doesn’t make now better. I don’t want to kill myself, but I wouldn’t mind dying in some random accident or event. The future seems bleak and pointless, I don’t want kids or to get married.",PillowBird-,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm8xao/working_45_hours_a_week_isnt_enough_still/
You don't seem that depressed. You look so happy and energetic...,"I have had two people say that too me. A close friend a few years ago and now my boyfriend, one I love oh so much. 

And the thing is, Yeah, I show the world that I am one happy ball of energy. I am always smiling and cheering others up but the truth is, I have had depression since I was a child, and I feel like absolute crap. I try to convince myself and others that everything is fine. I'm fine. 

The same girl who laughed and smiled and cracked jokes during theatre, is the same girl that tried to suffocate herself the day before, failed and went to bed like nothing ever happend. I haven't made a suicidal attempt in months, and I have not self harmed in almost two months now but I am fighting the urge.

I finally got put on Prozac. I have been on it for three days now, and its making my skin break out so bad, and I feel so dizzy and sick after I take it. I just want to give up. I want to tell my boyfriend that I'm not the happy girl that everyone see's me to be. That I feel like the world is crushing me down everyday, the real reason I was hospitilized back in august, but I just can't.

I don't want to ruin his view of me. He knows I'm depressed and stuff, but I just don't want to scare him off or seem to selfish talking about myself. And thats my problem. I was raised with parents who never taught me to talk about my feelings, they never validated it and insulted me to high heaven.

There is so much I want to do but can't because I just don't know how to tell other people how I am really feeling without feeling like a useless selfish person.",Doomlani,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnc0vr/you_dont_seem_that_depressed_you_look_so_happy/

reasoning depression,"Hi, this is my first reddit post. I'm curious if anyone out their can relate to some of these feelings because I have a difficult time getting it to land with therapists.

Since a very young age I was scared of death (infiniteness, you'll be dead for the rest of forever). As I've gotten older i've become more at peace with this but it's left me with a tinge to life that everything is provisional (relationships, dreams, memories). Therefor it's hard to motivate myself and difficult to take pride in accomplishments or happy moments because it just seems provisional. I'm about to graduate college, I have values, hopes, and purpose that I find meaning in, but it all seems like a band-aid. There's something about how life is just a product of the random collision of atoms, and I realize how annoying, that I truly can't shake. I'm wondering if anyone out there experienced something like this.",dean-kk,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnbwi9/reasoning_depression/
How can I deal with getting triggered?,"Hi guys, I’m new here and I’m not even sure if I’m in the right place. 

I come from a divorced family and growing up I felt as if I was trying to hold everyone together but ended up getting torn apart. I never saw a psychologist, not because I didn’t want to but because my dad wouldn’t send me to one. I have a lot of trauma and find little things very triggering.

I live with my mom, she is the most wonderful mom you can ask for, but like everyone else in the family she has also been affected by the divorce. I am short tempered like my father, a trait that I absolutely despise, and sometimes I act or say things similar to the comments my by my dad that tormented my mother. Yet I can’t help but to feel as if my dad had a point when feeling or making said comments. Every time this happens, my mom tells me to take life easy and dismisses my feelings, or says that no matter how perfect things are, I find something to complain about.

I feel as if she has weaponized my own feelings against me, I feel as if I can’t talk to her or say anything without feeling like my dad and all the horrible things he said/did. 

I have been getting triggered over the smallest things and it sends me into a state of pure rage and anger. I can feel my heart pump harder, front of my head get warmer, and feel as if something is about to come out from the inside of me. I can’t control these thoughts or calm down the rage and my only solution is to lash out at someone/something. 

I need guidance on what is happening, I need help figuring out why I feel this way and how I can control it. I need help communicating better without getting angry.

I lay in bed all day and can never get anything done,"I'm 17 years old and all I do is lay in bed all day and do nothing, and this isn't an exaggeration.

I can't get myself to do anything, watch TV, do homework, read, nothing. All I do is sleep or browse random things on my phone (usually social media). Sometimes, I don't even have motivation to do even that. I'm always so exhausted.

A lot of times I can't get myself to get up to get a drink of water, so I have to keep a water bottle in my room that gets warm often and I don't want to drink it anymore. I'm pretty sure I'm not drinking enough water.

I don't really leave the house since I have virtual school. I hated going to irl school because I was often lonely.

But man, since freshman year (I was still in irl school) my grades started dropping. I used to be an A student with a 3.5 GPA and and honors student, I even rarely got C's. That freshman year I had to drop my honors class with barley a C and I had to have tons of extra help in my math class since I had trouble paying attention. Now I always struggled getting my homework done, but since Freshman year it started to get worse trying to find motivation to get work done.

Flash towards to covid and virtual school. My GPA is now a 2.5. I can barley get a C anymore or pay attention to class. I procrastinate getting my work done. It's not that I'm dumb, just really unmotivated and can't pay attention.

I had a french class, which was one of my favorites. I even got an award for the best french student In my school. Now I failed french class as my only failing class and I got kicked from the class earlier this year for not attending classes or doing my work (which to be fair I didn't actually know I had to attend classes since It was a class in a different school and I didn't know what to do). 

I used to love studying languages, now I can't get myself to do even that.

I also have bad anxiety, social anxiety, and intrusive thoughts, which makes it even more difficult to talk to people.

Now the only times I do anything is getting up to draw, or write. (Struggle doing both)  I have started walking in my backyard a little but I haven't done it in a week or two because my earbuds broke and that put me out of the moodm

I used to preoccupy my time reading books and drawing  all day. Now I can barley do both. I tried to pick up a book the other day but I couldn't find the motivation to finish it (but I did get more than half way through). I do draw every other day but even that I don't do enough of and my art skills are suffering because of it.

There are many books I want to read but I can not find the motivation to start, even the books I start I can't finish (even if they are good). I am currently reading something but haven't picked it up in days. I used to be able to binge read books day after day, what happened?

As far as writing goes, I lack ideas because I don't read enough. Even if I have ideas, I have no motivation to write them.

I've even lost the motivation to play video games or use my laptop.

The only person I talk to is my best friend a bit every day by text. I do not talk to my other friends very often.

My hair looks a mess because I can't get myself or someone else to do it.

Now for those who are wondering, I am getting help. I have started taking to a counselor recently. We are making goals with each other to help me with my issues. I am also visiting a family member tommrow which will be the first time I'm out in a month or two.

I don't take medicine and won't be taking medicine unless it's a last resort.

But man, this past week for spring break has been horrible. I have hardly been out of bed all week

I'm going to bath off and catch up on homework today, maybe walk and draw, possibly read, do my hair. I want to change but man is it fucking hard. I have no motivation to live but I gotta keep going.

Avoiding the people I love,"These last past weeks have been the worst for me in several years when it comes to anxiety and depression. 

I've locked myself home, barely interacting with my family and avoiding going out to meet my friends. I feel I have absolutely nothing to provide to the conversation or their lifes as a friend. I'm so empty, anytime I get asked what I'm up to all I can say is 'same as always' and try to get them to talk about anything else. I don't participate in conversations or give any opinion, I just sit there like a spectator.

It's been a while I posted here. My mental health has been growing exponentially worse the last 2-3 months. I feel like shit and after a year of being clean I don't know when I will harm myself again or even try something worse.

I’m feeling guilty to feel depressed because my life might not be that bad after all,"I’ve been depressed for two years and 5 months, the thing that made me depressed wasn’t that much of a tragedy, it was just an inconvenience. 

Since I got depressed, I started to see a tragedy in everything, I thought every single minor inconvenience was worth killing myself for, I cried a lot, I often got hysterical, I screamed.. but for what? For things that aren’t even real? 

Whilst there are people who lose their families, friends, loved ones, jobs, struggle financially, physically, etc. 

I created problems out of nothing at all. I lost precious 2 years and 5 months of my life. I fought with my loved ones a lot over measly matters, broke their hearts, distanced myself from them, even lost some of them. 

I majored in I-still-don’t-know-what and failed 30 subjects, I probably created some shitty health problems and fucked my brain and body with stupid meds. FOR WHAT. 

I tried suicide twice, and FOR FUCKING WHAT. 

When I had everything, when I could lead a perfectly happy life, what did I do, what did I get myself into. 

I REGRET IT ALL SO FUCKING MUCH. 

Someone once told me that I probably don’t have any real problem and I create fake problems to suffer intentionally. 

Maybe my brain is fucking imbalanced, but honestly I don’t know if that’s true anymore. Considering I tried many many meds and none of them helped, it might not be chemical. Then what is it?

It’s probably because I’m just an ungrateful piece of shit, liking to be dramatic and suffering. 

I mean, I was suicidal over petty things for two years and 5 months. I tried to kill myself when I had practically no reason to do so (I was exaggerating things at that time). 

When I had no real problems, I created them myself, some of them were in my mind and some of them even became reality and messed up my life, probably beyond repair. 

Idk what to think anymore.

P.S. please don’t take it as an offence, I know that most people on this sub actually DO struggle, probably I do too, I’m just confused and don’t know what to think. All I wrote above is just about myself, not on depressed people in general.

I Wish I Never Existed Pt. 2,"(Sorry for making this another super long post) 


For those who didn’t read Pt. 1. my mom hates my guts and abused tf outta me, and my dad sucks too. But he’s a better choice than my mom. (Kinda) 

I tried to fit everything into part 1. But I left 1 part out. Plus. Some things happened recently which made me realize sum stuff. 

Long story short, I’m in NY visiting for abt a month or 2. My whole life is here. My future is here. And I met an amazing girl that I really like. 

None of that matters cause I’m going back to Florida. Where the only future I have is either milking cows or working at Walmart. 

I used to be addicted to drugs Back when I lived with my mom. I was at my friend’s house with my at the time gf. He gave us ecstasy and told us “it’s a fun drug for couples”. 

But I got hooked on it. It made me forget all my problems. Made me forget the world around me. It allowed me to live in my own universe. 

And I. Was. Hooked. I’d beg him to get me more. I lost friends and my gf because of it. Which made me wanna take more. The high was fucking amazing. 

But the coming down. Holy shit.  It made me wanna kill myself more than I already did. I was addicted for about 5-6 months. 

Until I had a friend help me detox. Molly was the only drug I ever tried. And I never did anything else ever again. 

But my friend wants to hang out Cause I haven’t seen his ass in like 6 years. But he wants to smoke weed together. 

And rn. I’m more depressed than I’ve ever fucking been. Idk if I should. I’m scared I’d get addicted. Ik weed is no where near as bad as Molly. But still. Idk shit abt drugs 

My brother is the perfect son in my dad’s eyes. Married with 2 kids. A good paying job. A big house in a nice neighborhood. And 2 college degrees. 

AND he’s a pastor in a church and is heavily involved multiple days a week. Which is everything my dad ever wanted and more. 

I always knew I wasn’t the favorite. Which never bothered me. I never wanted to be. Im the complete opposite. But damn. 

We went to my brother’s church. And ofc the head pastor of the church just talks positive abt him “he’s been a blessing to the people. The best preacher we have. Blah blah blah” 

And my dad answers “yea. He’s making me proud. I’m proud to call him a son. I love him.” I almost cried right fucking there in front of everybody. 

I haven’t cried in a LONG time. I’ve tried. Nothing makes me cry. But that made a tear fall down my cheek. He never fucking told me he’s proud of me. Never even told me he loves me. 

Whenever he talks abt me to other people. It’s always the negative shit. “He has mental problems. He’s like an animal, he’s brainless, He’s this. He’s that” but whenever it’s one of my brothers. Nothing but positive 

Now don’t get me wrong. I love my brother. He’s one of the few people I look up to and one of the fewer people I trust. 

And I realized. My depression isn’t my situation. It’s my dad. I didn’t realize it till this trip. If I don’t understand something. instead of just telling me what it is. 

He’ll call me a fucking brainless dumbass instead. Versus my brother. He treats me like I’m a human fucking being and explains it. And in general he treats me like I’m a human. My dad just acts like I’m this thing with no brain. 

And when he thinks I can’t hear him. He always says I’m mentally retarded. Ik I do in fact have some problems mentally. But I wouldnt go as far as to say Im Actually diagnostically retarded. 

My thing is. Im slower than most. Some take seconds to realize something (common sense) it takes me longer. Then I’ll be like ohhhhh. Duh. Or I don’t always understand what your telling me. 

But I don’t think that’s so bad to the point where I need to be in Sped classes with the kids who can’t even talk and still wear diapers like my dad says I am. 

But Ik Im the problem. Like my existence, not my mental problems. He left Me and my mom when I was 3 to live his life in Florida. He got married and everything. 

Good for him. I don’t give a shit. But after all the shit with my mom. I move in with him. I literally just showed up Into they’re lives. 

My stepsister moved out like 2 months after I moved in cause of me. My stepmom doesn’t like me. She tolerates me because she has to. But hates it. 

And I tell him shit all the time. And he either ignores me completely. Or on the off chance he hears me. Hell say that idk shit. Then boom. I was right. But he won’t even say “damn son. You was right” either. 

Most of his problems and struggles are caused by him. He fucks himself over. I’ve been telling him for YEARS. And he just says that I’m talking disrespectfully to him and I got an attitude. 

But my brother says the same exact shit I say. Word for word. Same tone. Exactly the same. Sometimes worse. My “attitude” is physical. Like I’ll wave my arms around as I talk to him. 

My brother is verbal. Mf will yell it at you (not in a disrespectful way) and say stuff like “ITS COMMON SENSE. USE YOUR LOGIC”

 and my dad just says “Damn son. You’re right. Imma change my life around. Thanks son. I wish someone told me before” 

And he’s also one of those parents. If he gets ME a PS4 for Christmas. Mf will say that it’s his PS4 cause he paid for it with his money. He said that abt an iPad he GIFTED me. A gift. As in “here. This is YOURS to keep” 

He went into it and completely changed my shit. Got rid of half of my shit. And added some random shit I don’t need or use. without asking. He just fucking grabbed it and did it. 

And when I tell him abt it. He said “it’s my iPad I can do whatever” so I factory reseted it and within the hour it was in his hands. 

Ig he realized that he was a fucking cunt abt it cause he was giving it back to me saying he’s sorry. I basically told him to fuck off and keep it. I don’t want it anymore. If you want to be this way. That’s fine. 

When i get a job. I’ll save up and replace all my shit. Will I be wasting a shit ton of money to buy shit I already have? Yes. Is that me being super fucking petty? Also yes. But it’s worth it. 

I’ll be able to call it mine cause I worked my ass off for it. 1000% mine. Im giving him everything. “His” videogames, “his” phone, “his” room, “his” bed “his” clothes. everything. Fuck him. I’m moving out the SECOND I get the chance. 

Speaking of moving out. apparently he wrote in his will that if he were to die. I go move in with my brother. And idk if it’s bad to say this. But kinda want it to happen. 

I’m not wishing death on him. That’s a bit much. (Kinda) But i wouldn’t want anything more in the world. Than to live with my brother. 

He’s married with 3 kids. 2 toddlers and a teenager. The wife and teen don’t do Shit. The wife works from home and she has her own social media business thing. 

But other than that. She don’t do Shit. And if they both sitting down on the couch watching tv. My brother is the one 1000% of the time. Getting up to take care of the kids. 

The teen just goes to school, come home, and lock herself in her room. Occasionally she’ll hang out with my brother. Just him and her. 

He’s working 3 Jobs. He does his main 9-5 monday-friday. Then he has church 3 days a week. Then he has a job Saturdays from the morning till like 2. 

And on top of that. He’s the only one taking care of the kids. Plus doing errands. Plus buying the food for dinner. Plus this plus that. I already have everything planned out. 

The church he works at has a super serious drama program. Some people involved eventually made it to broadway. I wanna be an actor. 

We were talking abt it the other day. Abt college and what I wanna be n shii. I told him I want to be involved in film/theater some how but my preference is acting. He immediately goes 

“wow. That great. That’s a really good choice. Damn. If you still lived out here I could’ve hooked you up to the plays we have here” which broke my fucking heart. 

MY BROTHER. WHO I BARELY SEE. supports me more than my own fucking father. He says that whatever I “pick” he doesn’t give a fuck. 

Cause eventually imma fail at what I want to do and I’m just gonna “follow my calling” and become a pastor. Or better yet. Be a pastor at his church 😐

Not everything is abt being a fucking pastor or doing your fucking homework. But anyways. Back to my brother 

So my plan would be to just help out. I’d help him with the girls. They fucking love me. I’d help clean up around the house. Do the dishes. Laundry. Etc etc. 

Just make his life easier. I’d also get involved in the church. Again. To help him out. I’d be his armor bearer which is churchtalk for assistant. 

Id get a job and whatever I’d made 50-50. I don’t have any bills or anything. But I’m an extra mouth to feed. So let that 50 be rent or sumthin. Idk. 

Ik It sounds like fantasy land or sumthin. Like living with him is rainbow and sunshines. Which is not. It comes with its own set of rules and shit. But we understand eachother. 

And the “negatives” of living with him aren’t that bad. Most of it would be work related stuff which I’m good at. Sweep and mop, do laundry, etc etc. And babysit the kids. No problem with none of that 

My dad always refers to us to other people as “the boys &amp; Isaiah” or “my sons and Isaiah” (I’m Isaiah) why am I separate? 

It’s because I’m not going to college and I got bad grades and I’m not involved in church. Vs them. Who all had all A’s, multiple degrees, and in church. 

he just wants me to join a fucking church. It’s all this nigga ever fucking talks about. School and church. There’s more to fucking life than school and church. Fuck.

I know for a fact that I had depression in middle school and I can't remember before that. My depression has not given me any breaks and I don't think it ever will. I'm terrified that I will die before I ever experience happiness or confidence. I'm afraid that I will live out my whole life in misery hoping and waiting for they day I am cured, a day that will never come. Why live out a whole life of unhappiness waiting for something that will never happen. But I'm also afraid that if I cut my own life short, I'll have cheated myself of a great life that was only months away. That's one of the things that have kept me going, knowing that it is silly to judge my future when I've barely lived a fourth of my total life. But it's really hard since I have no signs that point towards a life of happiness.

I've up until recently been extremely depressed. A few weeks ago I felt I got better though and thought I escaped depression.

Alright time to get my words on the internet for everyone to judge me secretly,"i’ve rewritten this 5 time now hopefully this is the one i’ll post 

I’m starting to feel super alone and invisible at my school and at home 
i’m a quiet kid with no social skills and enough anxiety to kill a horse but in the past few weeks i’ve been feeling like i don’t matter to the world or to any of my friends.
what i mean is like i never get invited to go out with friends anymore my best friend isn’t inviting me out i’m constantly playing video games with someone who lives way out of reach and a girl i like decided to lead me on then change her mind and i never get girls so i was actually hopeful for a minute there and honestly i feel like i’m treated like a ghost and no one cares about me and i’m starting to lose all faith in myself and i don’t know who to tell because i suck all my feelings in and hide them away 

if someone wants to dm i wouldn’t complain anyways that’s my words that i had to vomit out thanks for reading",RepresentativeNeck19,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnd0sb/alright_time_to_get_my_words_on_the_internet_for/
Its Just Bad Brain Chemistry,"I use to live a happy social lifestyle, I didn’t have to act to fit in, it was just my nature. 

Drugs are something I would never have sort out but my friends all did them and I just went along with it.

Guess I had a predisposition to them because after only a couple party pills my brain chemistry was permanently altered.

My ability to read emotions is gone. I cant just relax and be myself around people anymore because I don’t understand them. I cant read social cues anymore and I get bad anxiety.

If I were to force myself to be a bit goofy and make someone laugh like i did effortlessly in the past I’m sure i would panic, my face would twitch (a common reaction in people with bad anxiety) and looking them in the eyes would feel like an electrical shock so naturally I would look down at my feet. 

So now I’m an awkward introvert with creeping depression.

The point I’m trying to make is that, depression is just bad brain chemistry. If your brain was healthy you would be happy and life would feel like a wonderful gift.

My understanding of depression is that something went wrong, it might have been a physical or psychological change  but your brain couldn’t handle it and depression was the result.

If you have struggled with depression your whole life theres a good chance you were born with bad chemistry or perhaps your parents did drugs during your conception. Maybe your parents were abusive and your brain had to put walls up and shut off.

For a lot of us there is no cure, theres just live with it as best you can. We cant get a new brain or become a child again and soak up social behaviour until we become extroverted. 

For some there is hope, maybe your brain will give you another chance and I hope it does.

Random rant,"Hi y’all I’m just gonna rant about “some” stuff that I’ve been keeping to myself for the last 15 ish years. Reason? I don’t know. Maybe pity or maybe because I feel like I’m about to become a psychopath. I don’t know really. 

My whole life, since the minute I was born was based on expectations and reputation. 

I had to sit straight, smile, not laugh, be polite, eat right, can’t make my own life decisions, learn calligraphy, be at the top of my classes, respect my enemies, discard my feelings, can’t be ugly, can’t be too skinny or too fat, can’t have a single mark on my face, be pretty else no one would dare like me, my favorite color had to be blue, certain meals I must love. I had to be a doll. 

Everything I ever did had to be calculated. Everyone has to believe that I am society’s perfect little doll. But my one flaw was that I am a damn human. I have feelings. And it always got in the way of everything. 

I craved my father’s love. I so desperately wanted it. I wanted him to look at me for once in his life and say “I love you” or “You’re doing great.” Is it that hard? 

But I’ve never gotten that. He’d say it to my cousins, he’d kiss their forehead every morning he’d tell them that they are a piece of his heart. When they failed their tests he’d give them money it but presents and tell them that at least they tried.  

He even thought them how to ride a bike! Like can you image that?! A god damn bike! And I have never learned. 

But I, his blood born daughter got nothing of the sort. If I got anything below a 100 I’d get punished. I’d get burned or slapped, or I’d starve. I was told that I’m a failure an abomination. And he never took me out anywhere. I’d be stuck home while he’d take my cousins to Disneyland or some zoo. 

Anyway, when I finally did bring that 100, nothing happened. I didn’t get a kiss on the forehead, I didn’t get a pat on the back, I didn’t get a smile. I didn’t get anything. I got a “Let’s see if you can keep the 100 for next time or will you just be a disgrace to your family.” I tried. I swear I tried. I worked my butt off. I studied I rewrote tests answers and questions I rewrote passages from our homework over and over until I could memorize every line. I did whatever I could think off to make sure I got that 100. But nothing ever satisfied him. 

My dear mother, the women who I am told I am indebted to only reminded me how she sacrificed her life for me so I’ve ought to pay her back in double. I don’t even know how I could even do just that. 

My younger brother, who never do bats an eye at me, who never cares about me, I swear I tried to mend our relationship several times for 6.5 years. But nothing ever worked. I don’t know what I did wrong. But he loathes me. 

Over the years if my life I made several attempts to make friends, each and every single one of them treated me like the sole of their shoe, they’d either beat the hell out of me or they’d literally try to murder me. So I’ve given up on that. 

Obviously I’m not meant to please anyone. 

I don’t know, really I don’t know anything. All I know that there is clearly something wrong with me. Something seriously wrong with me because if there wasn’t my father wouldn’t loathe me and treat me differently than everyone including my brother, my mother wouldn’t be the way she is and my brother wouldn’t be so damn distant from me all the time even tho we r literally under the same roof. I wouldn’t been hurt by my “friends“ several times.

Don't be depressed all day. Not waking up with anxiety and tachycardia, and being afraid of calls coming in from someone at work.

Have an illusion for something, an objective. Having someone to talk to, whether it's a family member, a friend, or even a girlfriend. I don't have anyone, I can't even go to the movies because I don't go alone.

I just want to get out of the way and I don't do it because I don't screw up my family.

giving more emotion than you receive,"i've slowly lost most of my friends in the last 2 years and i'm so isolated and lonely 

i've never had a partner which doesn't usually bug me since i've never cared about that kind of thing but lately it's got me thinking something is wrong with me cause by my age almost everyone is with someone/has been with at least 1 person and i can't even imagine how amazing it feels to have someone who loves you truly and you love back like i can't even imagine what that feels like

i feel like something is wrong with me every friendship i have lately i feel like i'm closer with the person then they do me

there's been so many times i've thought of how much someone's friendship means to me only to realize they barely even think of my existence and we slowly drift apart and i end up feeling they hate me (which isn't true they just don't think about me anymore) how do people just forget others i wish i could do that i think about people from my past so much

i do get we all have our own busy adult lives and our own demons to deal with but it just hurts going through life feeling like i always like people more than they like me

i play video games alone most of the time now and it makes me feel so empty i miss playing with friends. i used to do fun things with friends but now i spend all my time not at work alone in my room with my dog

i feel like i'm invisible and if i was to die tonight no ones lives would be effected much i'm such an invisible existence that brings nothing to the table

i'm so empty and replaceable and don't even have a close group of friends anymore i miss having that so much but they moved on and found new friends and partners and sometimes i'm mad about it and say good riddance and sometimes i'm just sad and feel like i could have done more to stay friends instead of pushing them away the second i felt they didn't care about me anymore

recently one reached out saying they missed me but when i tried making plans they flaked out so i don't understand why people give you empty words when they never plan on actually following through on it? what is the point of getting someones hopes up

i just wanna know is this how adult life is always going to be like? i'm 25 now and feel like the older you get the harder it is to make friends so how the heck am i ever going to make good friends again and how the heck do people cope with being this lonely? i know i'm not the only one so i wish all us lonely ppl could be friends i wish i could be there for anyone feeling the same way, no one deserves to feel this alone and empty inside i wish we could all be happy and have support",shinypichuu,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnclur/giving_more_emotion_than_you_receive/

So A Lot Has Happened...,"Life has its ways of messing with me. For some, it's a freak accident, or a sudden illness. For me, it's the loss of a dear companion.  Angel, the family cat, is no longer with us. She had to be put to sleep because we didn't have the money to get her the treatment she needed to live out the rest of her days in comfort.

It may seem selfish of me, but I find myself angry; I feel as if my father didn't care about her. Hell, he conveniently ""forgot"" to let me say goodbye to her. So, here I sit, in mourning over our dearly departed friend. Bemoaning the fact that she'll never search around the dinner table for scraps ever again. It's just...Painful to live without her.

How do I focus on myself?,"So I (21F) started dating when I was like in 7th grade. They were age appropriate relationships but the point is that I started dating young. Because I went to school, it was easy to find partners &amp; whatnot but my last relationship ended my freshman year of college (about 2 years ago). Now that I’m an adult, in the real world, I can’t really find partners at school (because of the pandemic &amp; im taking a break from school) or at work (I work with older people). So I’ve been single for 2 years which has been the longest since my first relationship ever. I’ve talked to a couple of people but never anything official. Now I’m realizing that I don’t want to be single. I hate being single. I feel so empty. I feel like life is pointless. But I moved back into my moms house &amp; I don’t have a career or a degree &amp; those are things I need to work on so I can move out &amp; be independent but I have no desire to do any of it because I don’t have a partner. I know it might sound ridiculous but I just feel like life has no purpose if I don’t have someone to share it with. Anyway, I feel like this isn’t right &amp; I should focus on myself but like I said, I can’t. I have no drive or motivation. How can I focus on just me? Please help.

Im the biggest dumbass ever.,"I've been struggling with depression for months now and there's this girl and I like her a lot who is the biggest help getting me through it. We're good friends and I was doing so good for like three months and today we were messing around and I jokingly threw my water bottle at her and it slipped, and it hit her in the eye. She started bleeding from her eye and I don't really want to go into details but that was one of the worst experiences of my life. I think the worst to be exact. I apologized about a million times and when it started to hurt less for her she started smiling because I was apologizing so much. It wasn't that bad and after a little while it looked like two small scratches on her eye area. 

I swear, I either a. dont do anything, then hate myself for not doing anything or b. try to do something, fail and then hate myself. The worst part is I don't know if it will be able to go back to normal, and it most definitely made her like me a lot less.  I cried when I got home today, from embarrassment, sadness and feeling bad for her.

Clings onto fictional people,"I basically have no friends. All I do is talk to myself when my family is out having fun and I’m staying in my house alone. I’ve pretended I’m talking to a therapist but I’m reality in just crying to myself about my sad pathetic life. Then I also lean on celebrities and have fantasies about certain ones which causes me to have a sexuality crisis every other week. Like my family pretty much know I’m a homosexual but part of me hates myself for it and I feel like people secretly judge me even when they say they’re okay with it.

I just feel like this life is too much. I had the same song replaying all day and sat there pretending I was talking to my celebrity crush who was also my therapist. This sounds like something so childish and it is but this is my sad life. I’m so lonely that I pretend I’m talking to a random person who doesn’t even know I exist.

So now I can’t stop seeing myself as this Daniel kid and it’s making me stressed out. Also when I found out about Bill Skarsgard I wanted to be reincarnated as him as well for some reason.

Need help or advice,"Hello this is my first reddit post. A little background, I'm 21 year old male who has had bouts of suffering with depression since puberty. However lately things had been going very well for me. I graduated college, started my career, making strong gains in the gym, and even recently went on a couple dates with a beautiful young woman.

That was until I was hit by a car a week and a half ago. I won't tell the whole story because it's not really relevant but now all those things I worked for are sinking away. My body, although my injuries are recoverable, is wrecked and all my time in the gym seems for naught. Although I haven't been fired from my job yet my bosses have been difficult and clearly despise me for not being there. I told this girl what had happened to me and although initially sympathetic, immediately those messages dried up like the Sahara, and I'm sure she's already talking to another guy.

I guess besides the depressing rant I'm wondering how do I somehow prevent my mental health from falling into an abyss that I already feel is approaching.

Unsure how to approach my university,"TLDR; I’ve been in the worse place mentally my whole life, but haven’t informed my uni out of fear of it leaking, haven’t been attending university. I’m scared that if I open a conversation after one term of doing nothing, that they’ll kick me out, what’s ur experience with universities dealing with this?  

I was diagnosed with severe depression and high anxiety in November and was but on a cycle of 50mg Zoloft, it was a nightmare to adjust to and completely numbed me out, I lost all drive and ambition, couldn’t process any emotion. Stopped doing all uni work, sat in my dorm and would drink a bottle of vodka just so I could feel something, then I’d end up having such an immense self hatred of turn to self harm. I was upped to 100mg in February and it only made things worse. I’ve since come off the meds and trying to get my shit together without them, but I’m scared my university work has been so heavily jeopardised last term that consulting the university about it in hopes to see if I can get an exemption of some sort would just be futile since the horse as left the barn and would result in being expelled from the course regardless. It’s been 3 months.

I don't know where to begin,"I've been dwelling on making a post here but I just decided not to because I've always worried about looking weak or really anything. I'm nineteen, my birthday is tomorrow. I have very bad scoliosis that.. got bad???? around when I was 14, I don't know if its scoliosis, it might, I have perpetual pain. I often try to ask for help with appointments but my family coddled me and demeans me when I try to do something myself. It hurts to go outside, to walk, sit sometimes and I've been putting on weight. I feel miserable and like one would expect, I play games.  


I'm high-functioning autistic, I think. My friends always say I miss social queues, I had no friends in high school, everyone felt like they were just giving me pity. I have good grades and in uni I just, I don't have the desire to do anything. my assignments are done the day they are due to my detriment,, my psychologist says I should see a club but I just, in a paradox, hate and love people. I'm sweet but I'm just perpetually bitter and resentful of those above me. Everyone who has put me down always was skinnier, prettier, or just wealthier than I. I can't reconcile my feelings about superiors, I refuse to let any injustice happen to my friends who I somehow have but all it does is make me feel shitty when people act against me. I tell myself every day that I'm a good person and I try to treat others well but when I go off at someone, its just unlike the person I want to be. I know everyone losses their cool but I just have guilt. I can't reconcile my guilt anymore because its a weight. It feels wrong when I let someone dig a hole for themselves because, while sometimes it's deserved, it just feels like i'm enabling an issue I could fix, I could do something to fix it, and nearly every time I try, I screw it up

I have (had) someone I try to talk to, to make amends with. We had a fight but they said were okay now but, there were scars, I don't wanna talk about specifics but it got bad, but were okay, they wished me a happy birthday before they went to bed for work.   


I just feel like i'm in a perpetual state of inner hate and disgust of others. Resentment of others, innate superiority, it feels awful I hold these feelings but I do, yet at the same time, I don't act on my hatred of others, it's a deep-down thing. I know its bad but just deep down I feel this way, I don't know what to do, I can't reconcile my emotions.

It feels like no one knows me or can relate to me,"I don’t want to burden my friends or family with this, so I suppose I’ll vent here. 

I survived a horrific upbringing that has left me traumatized. I’m very lucky that I made it past age 18 and wasn’t killed, but sometimes I wish I would’ve died anyways so I wouldn’t have to live with the pain that they caused me. Since I came out of that horrible situation, I was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder that impacts my every move. 

I don’t know a single person who can even remotely relate to what I suffered. The only people who can relate are people who are victims of horrible true crime stories that you see on the news. So I’m living my daily life with this burden that no one can connect with. 

I don’t *want* a single person to relate to what I suffered. No human should have to go through what I was put through. But what’s hurtful is that no one even wants to hear my story. 

I’ve tried talking to ‘friends’ about what I went through. I put ‘friends’ in quotes because I don’t have too many people in my life who actually act like friends. Hearing my story was so upsetting to them that they cut me off and refused to let me finish what I was trying to share. This has happened multiple times. On one occasion, it even turned into *me* comforting *them* because they were so upset by my story. 

It’s terrifying for me to share my story, and when ‘friends’ do this to me, I don’t feel supported. 

This is going to sound selfish but I don’t care and I’m gonna say it anyways. If anyone out there is reading this, don’t shame me for what I’m about to say: I *deserve* to have my story told and heard. If I had to suffer through it, and you consider me a true ‘friend’ then you have to suffer through hearing it. I know it’s not easy to know that someone you care about was nearly killed. But I shouldn’t have to carry this weight by myself. 

I’ve been able to share *some* of my story with *some* people in my life (friends and family), but I haven’t been able to share the full extent of my story with anyone because I don’t feel like my story is welcome or that people want to hear it. The only people on earth who know the full extent of what I suffered are myself and the two people who put me through it. 

It’s so hurtful. I’m in so much pain.   

So many survivors get to share their stories. Why does no one want to hear mine?",sleepyboi08,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tndpu3/it_feels_like_no_one_knows_me_or_can_relate_to_me/
Idk what to do anymore,"As the intro says idk what to do anymore, I am constantly overthinking about everything and that has caused me to not have any friends or anyone to talk to and let my thoughts consume and take over. Since this is my very first post or even my first time ever opening up to someone either online or in person I guess I should shed some light on me. 

Well growing up I never had any friends or anyone to talk to I always always the kid who had his head in the books, then came HS where I was bullied every day by multiple people. Then in senior year of HS I decided to start coming out as gay and well that was the worst decision I ever made in my young life because as a result I lost all my “friends” or at least those who I thought were my friends turns out they weren’t, and then on top of that the bullying increased to the point where I started to receive death threats including ones that I found on my front door at home. 

Now that I’m an adult I still have no friends and I can barely talk to anyone without the feeling that I’m being a bother to them and it’s even worse when they leave me on read it makes me feel like my thoughts were correct. And to make my depression worse about a year ago I was a victim of domestic violence and as a result it’s now extremely difficult to trust anyone or even open up my feelings to anyone either.

Is happiness just tricking yourself into thinking existence is good?,"I understand there are many great things about life, i'm not some super edgelord that can only see the bad, there's great food, there's great music, there's great people and so on...

But for every good thing in this life, there's like 5 bad things + 4 horrible things + 1 absolutely terrible thing.

Maybe it's just my depression making me focus on the bad, but even ignoring the emotional and just trying to see it from a logical perspective, existence seems like an objectively bad thing and the people that say they are happy on an existential level are either ignorant of how bad it is or they've learned how to trick themselves into thinking it's good, at least that's the only way i can get my head around it.

If this is really it, then please somebody teach me how to do it, because the feeling i get is that this was some secret lesson that a lot of people got from their parents or school, and i was just never exposed to it.

Right now, this thing we call life, sounds like an absolute shit show of a deal we got without consent, and the fact that we are born into a capitalism system that basically tells you that even though you were born without a choice, you still have to work for a living, makes me absolute furious and hopeless.",CriticalIntrospec,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmx5z7/is_happiness_just_tricking_yourself_into_thinking/

And now I have no appetite most of the time and have no desire to eat, the only reason I eat is because my dad makes dinner and I don't want to alarm him.

I suffer from depression, agoraphobia or whatever it's called and selective mutism, and I realize this is how my entire life will be because I'm too scared to do anything. The only things I have in life besides for my 1 friend is gaming, writing Harry Potter fanfiction, anime and other nerdy things.

I've really tried to fight it but it's impossible, I told myself whenever I felt like shit to fight back but it doesn't work, it really doesn't so I don't want to hear it.

The only friend I have is getting married, he's younger than me, and here I am having done literally nothing with my life, obviously I want to feel happy for him but I can't feel happy about anything. I don't care what any ""professional"" has to say about getting better or how many psychologists tell me this or that, to not focus on my thoughts and so on. I've had so many psychologists but they all just give up in the end. 

I escape into my fanfiction writing, that's really the only time I can feel some fake version of ""happiness"", I've done this since I was about 11-12.

I've thought of overdosing on my anxiety medicine, but I'm a fucking coward and it will probably be slow and painful but I'm kind of used to that by now because I always have this feeling of getting crushed.

I don't know what I'm asking for, why I write this embarrassing rant-thing. Friends, hugs? I don't know if I even deserve friends because I've been so horrible to past friends and they've all left me except for this one guy that keeps putting up with me. Idk I'm just rambling at this point.

I guess some part of me still wants to feel better, and that's why I write this stupid thing on reddit. Judge me all you want, but mentally I'm done.

TLDR: Never done anything at all with my life and losing my fucking mind, 1 single friend, gaming/Harry Potter etc. is the only escape I have.",SilverKoala2199,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmp717/struggling_want_to_die/
Exhausted,"I've never been this tired in my life. I'm fucking exhausted all the time.

I feel completely disconnected from everything around me,"I am losing myself and I feel further away from myself with each passing day. I am surrounded by people and get up everyday to do what I have to do but I am on auto pilot. I don't feel anything but overwhelming sadness and anger. My mother died in January and everything fell on me. My brother fell apart, my partner tried his best to keep me from completely spiraling out of control but I just felt numb. I went to a concert last night and got pretty tipsy, I just wanted to rage against everything and everyone. I don't want to be around anyone I don't want to do anything I just want to be alone in the dark quiet. Intimacy is completely void, I literally cried afterward. I feel so lost right now. I am wearing a pretty mask but I dont know how much longer I want to. It is exhausting and just pisses me off. I want to scream and break things. I want to tear shit up. But I can't. I have kids in my life, they're not mine but they are my stepkids and they expect me to not fall apart. Everyone expects me to not fall apart. That's the fucking problem, I am the one that holds it all together in EVERY SINGLE PART OF MY LIFE.

I am alone,"This is going to be a bit of a rant idek if this is allowed here - TL;DR nobody likes me. I came to visit my parents today and they told me they’re worried about how alone I am as I have nobody. 


I have no friends, and my entire life nobody has liked me. I try as hard as I can to always be kind, courteous, and go the extra mile for people. I’m careful about what I say, I try to make people laugh and smile, I try to always put them first, nobody likes me. I read how to be a good friend, I read about how to make friends… nothing seems to work. I put myself out there, I do lots of activities, I try to talk to people, nobody wants to talk to me. 

I’ve tried being confident, outgoing, self-assured - that didn’t work either. 

People have always said unkind things about me, people have told me to commit stop living, people have told me the world would be better without me. People go beyond not liking me and actually hate me. 

People hated me at university, I got told people didn’t like that I didn’t have to try to get good grades (my tutor told me this, we had a close relationship - strictly professional). 

I’m tired of being alone, and I’m tired of being the bad guy. I’m so sick of people telling me to learn to love to be on my own and learn to love myself. I’ve been on my own my entire life, do I not deserve friends? Yes it’s important to do things alone but I want to have friends to do them with too. It’s impossible to love yourself when all you hear is how awful you are, despite trying to be the best you can be.

why me,"sometimes I wonder what the fuck is life cause some of the things I experience are too specific and unusual that it makes me wonder why me . some of the things I get myself into are weird as shit and aren't traditional things to cause depression.  I think of myself as a very strong willed person and someone who isn't easily disturbed by people or insults or bullying or hate or parents divorcing or death, all that Is something i can handle. but when it comes to these little things in my life, I just tend to run away from them and even cause my depression. when I look at suicidal people I can never relate to them at all which makes me even more depressed. sometimes I don't even know if anyone is even in the same position as me. just wanted to get it off my chest",Iarvae,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tnd876/why_me/
I need a lift,I’ve suffered depression for a long time and for the last few years I thought I have found some peace. But recently I’ve been in a very dark place. I don’t know what has come over me but I just can’t clear my mind and I cry throughout the day. As soon as I wake up I feel super depressed. I wasn’t always like that.

I'm close to giving up/rant.,"34f, first time posting, long time struggler with depression.

I've been fully medicated for well over 8 or 9 years now and occasionally therapy, although I've never been good about following up with it. Changed meds several times and have always been compliant about medication.

I moved back to my home state after being gone since i was 19. I basically ran away and chased after boys to find love, acceptance and my place I felt I could be comfortable with and loved. I never really found that place, so I came back.

I feel like my depression has gotten far worse since moving back. I went from being completely independent with lots of friends, good job and great apartment..
 to having to live in my brother's basement apartment, not eating, and smoking weed all day to kill the boredom of my WFH job. I've never done the type of work I do now. It's been so incredibly damaging to my mental health.I know I can just get a new job, but I don't have any motivation to better my life. I don't feel like I have purpse. 

I have made 1 genuine friend recently and that has been helpful and helped with my loneliness. But we all know that friends can only provide a certain level of comfort, because that's all they are able to do. This isn't a complaint, just confirming.

I'm so incredibly lonely and struggle with feeling valid. I crave to have someone care about me and just wants to spend quality time with me. I'm tired of being put last or not even considered. Maybe I'm not ready or those I'm pursuing aren't available.. but I fall for it everytime. It's like an addiction to find someone to spend time with me and hold my hand. I wad also scammed over Christmas from all my savings to a man pretending to be someone else who promised romance and financial security(which wasnt much, but it was all i had).. I haven't even gotten close to recovering from that, either.. both emotionally and financially. It sounds like I'm just desperate for love and i hate that impulse.

I've been struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts. I don't plan on acting on them, but I think about jumping off a cliff near the beach all the time. There are times I will walk a little closer than I should when taking a walk near the water.. just to see what I would do or what might happen. I've never really had such intense thoughts and it's bothersome. The only reason I am not acting on it is I would feel guilty making others feel bad.

I'm defeated and so tired. I'm missing work and not focusing.

My friend is trying the best they can to help by saying to think positively and to distract myself more but I can't do it in a split second, if anything for me right now thinking positive is the hardest thing I can ever do right now because more problems keeps happening, and they won't stop, I just can't get myself to think positively, to second this, i have clinical depression that I've been going through for years, but it's just been getting worse, I can't do anything about it.

Always ready to cut off,"My previous boyfriend used to say I am a negative person. I always look at the negative things before the positive ones. My present boyfriend jokes about how narcissistic I am. 
But when you are all alone without a safety net, is it wrong to measure the water before diving? 
I let very less people come close to me. And the ones who come close, I consider them too precious to lose. Accept my family I am always scared to be hurt by people who are close to me. Whatever they do, however they react I try to think maybe they don't want me near them. Maybe I am considering people close to me who doesn't have the same feeling about me. What if they just don't love me. What if they can't express that I am pushy. 
All these makes me often stop looking at the love they give me. Sometimes small things make me push them away.

And for two years I was in almost total isolation, with only a few occasional visits, but the stress of the treatment, added to the isolation and the beginning of college, made me feel unmotivated for everything, even though I had tests that I don't know how to answer myself. I don't feel motivated to study (and I only get grades due to others), most of the time I don't feel any emotion and sometimes I feel extreme sadness or anger, I just lie in bed or do something useless most of the time.

being sick is triggering,"Hi y'all!

I'm new to this subreddit but wanted to pop in here... I think ultimately to feel less alone in my experience.

I was on a really good stint of doing things and was feeling good.

And then I got sick. Well, it was like a series of little things, and then the last week I've been sick.

All in all, I've been pretty dang bed ridden the last two weeks.

And I find I start to slip. Everything starts to feel bad. Everything feels hard.

I start to wonder if I'm sliding back. How much is in my head, maybe I should just shake it off?
But I'm actually sick.. haha

I'm on the mend now, and have therapy today, but wanted to see if being sick does the same for anyone else

Trying to make an effort but feel unheard,"Lately, I've actually been making an effort and am in the process of setting up therapy. But a few of the closest people in my life have been ignoring what I say and the advice that I give and it's really put me off speaking. Just an example, my boyfriend has had short string of instances lately where he didn't listen to me when I was speaking, so much that I said ""I have something to say, could you please listen?"" out of desperation. Not only that but because he felt so bad, he neglected to make it up to be following it even though I asked for reassurance to make me feel better. And now because of unseen circumstances, his attention is elsewhere and I just feel insane.

How do I open up to my psychologist and not understate my mental health?,"In 2 weeks I’m finally getting a mental health evaluation. 

I have seen a psychologist before (around 5 years ago) for anxiety/depression/agoraphobia but even then I never fully stated how bad it was and how it was affecting me. 

My anxiety has gotten slightly better but my depression deteriorated. I have Asperger’s, ADD and the past 2 years or so have developed OCD(self diagnosed). 

I fear that if I mention the OCD thing, which started to affect me bad, I might not be taken seriously and it’ll be waved aside.

As for the depression, I have a habit of saying ‘but it’s fine, it’s not important, I manage’ even when I am dying inside.

I have been waiting almost 2 years for this appointment and I want to get the right help. 
I have been physically sick the past 5 years (chronic pain and autoimmune diseases) and it has contributed to my mental healths current state. 

But when looking at things from a realistic point of view, there isn’t any reason for me to feel so bad, so I am not sure how to explain this emptiness. 
Everyday is too hard for me to deal with and I don’t want to be here but I don’t really have a reason to feel this way and this just makes me feel worse. I feel like because of this I might not let them know what is going on.

I am so tired of things and I no longer want to try because nothing I have tried so far has helped me. Even things looking ‘better’ in the future don’t sound good to me because I no longer care, I just don’t want to be here anymore.
But I remember who I was before and I still feel in my heart who I am, and I have crazy amount of love for life and I just want to be able to feel that again, if that is possible. 

Is there any way I could make it easier to express what is going on with me? I just want to be taken seriously and be understood.",Plantreads,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn8mtx/how_do_i_open_up_to_my_psychologist_and_not/

reoccurring daydream,So I've been having this reoccurring daydream of the day my dad passed. I just keep seeing the room and picturing the crying. It all started after a Netflix show that was rather emotional and these memories just keep coming back. I'm pretending I'm OK but fuck my heart hurts right now. I miss alot of people that were close to me. I think it's part of reason I'm scared to get close because it means something bad will happen.

I just want to know if im actualy the one who did somthing wrong,"  

So yesterday (3/23/22) I was at tennis practice in my school’s gym, one of the coaches come in and says that we cannot have practice today because the water is not working (like the water was shutoff its not running) so it was 3:30 the regular bus leaves at 3:30 normally after tennis I ride my schools activity bus which left at 5:45. To give you some context I do not have a phone, so I thought “okay I can’t have tennis practice so I’ll just go to study hall and ride the activity bus like I would normally” so that’s what I did I got home at 6pm to find my mom yelling at me saying things how I should have rode the regular bus and that I had time and I was trying to outsmart her. She added a few more aggressive words in there like calling me the b word and saying how I’m f-ing stupid. Now I’ve always wondered if it was normal for parents to cuss out their kids or if she was verbally abusing me, but anyway she told that me that the whole school needed to be shut down and that I was stupid for staying and riding the activity bus. After that I went to my room and cried (like ugly ugly cried) and was hyperventilating. But whenever my mom is mad at me she always calls her friends and tells them how bad of a kid I am… but im getting of topic more importantly im so so so so so confused why she expected me to ride the regular bus and how I should of contacted her, but I don’t understand how I should of called her. And sorry its hard to explain how I feel but im more sad that she didn’t even ask if I was okay she just yelled and cursed me out, but I was finally so happy when I made it home because I was so scared when I was at school.

am I in the wrong?,"for backstory: 

I've had depressive symptoms for several years that come in waves. I struggle with most of depressions symptoms. I'm diagnosed with OCD. I have social anxiety. 

I've always been a pretty decent student and force myself to get all my work done (I'm in highschool) to the point where I push down all emotion and shut down to do what I have to do. 

My parents are supportive through this rough mental health journey although sometimes they get a little impatient with my recovery...

Recently I've hit a burn out point which leaves me sulking, sleeping more, loss of appetite, not attending school and avoiding anxiety inducing situations etc.. I'm usually very good at hiding my symptoms and I'm usually very bubbly and try my best to people please. 

so here is why I'm here. My parents want me to have friends and go to school etc. Thing is, Ive been going to an alternative school for the past 2 years and it has been going well where I have made friends etc. So yes I've been around people my age and teachers. I even 
met my current boyfriend there. 

Recently, I switched to another alternative school, which I didn't want to happen but anyway, and I'm really struggling to start there. Change is awful so uhm haha. 
My parents don't like this at all ofc. I barely go to school and if I do it's like one hour. I'm supposed to graduate high school this June but with how things are going.. Anyway so bringing back my lovely boyfriend, I hang out with him regularly and even if it's stress inducing to walk to his house and take public transit, I do it. I always have a good time with him and he's one of the few things i look forward to. My parents don't like this bahahah. They think ""where does all that energy go?? Why don't you put that energy into going to school???"" I always reply that its different, seeing him is nice and is worth the stress and yes I want to finish school but it's 
way more difficult, especially a new environment. 

Maybe they're right. What am I doing. But I guess I just wish they'd notice how much progress with my social anxiety this is. I mean going alone on public transit and walking for that long is so amazing for me like I'm proud of myself and no one recognizes that. 

I'm always asked for more and I'm just tired and now I'm judt questioning if I shouldn't hang out with my boyfriend as much and level it out but that won't change anything like ?!?! 

anyway thank you for reading this if you do...

"Unsure if I have depression, looking to share some information in exchange for some","Just looking for some insight here. I have an anxiety disorder which has its normal complications, but to those of you who have depression, does this sound similar? Every day I wake up at my normal time of 9AM, and it just becomes a waiting game for 4PM where I get to lift with my friends, then spend the rest of the night hanging out/playing games with them. The problem is that waiting game stresses me the hell out. I have no problem getting out of bed, no problems sleeping, I enjoy all my usual activities,  and if I have a busy day I'm eager to tackle it, but on the days where I have nothing, I just pace around the house thinking, and when I see time moving slow I get super stressed worrying I'm gonna be bored every day. And right before bed, I always feel super stressed that it's going to be the same thing the next day. I'm currently on the job search, but just the thought of waiting around for weeks on end absolutely triggers my anxiety bad. Am I just lazy/unmotivated/unaware of how to best fill my time, or am I depressed?

"Suicidal, hopeless and don't want therapy anymore","Without going into detail, I've tried almost all medical treatments and have been suffering with bipolar depression, social anxiety, bunch of stuff for over a decade. I gave up years ago but continue going through the motions for family. I've frequently bailed on appointments with psychologists and social workers though, to the point where I'm wasting both mine and their time. Because I know I don't believe I'll get better and don't want to anymore. I just try to force myself to co operate because the alternative is death. 

What do I do? I feel guilty for avoiding appointments, and guilty after them. I feel like I can't even be honest in them, because the risk of being hospitalised against my will are so high discussing suicide (this psychologist has called hospital on me years ago, so I have little trust left in the mental health system). I could just be honest and go to hospital, have my rights taken, go through that experience again. But I know it won't change anything, only make my life worse.

"Social media....""damaged""..","I've really been wondering why my depression keeps getting worse and worse. I have all the emoional tools to move forward, but I keep falling backwards. The answer is social media. Spend any amount of time on reddit, instagram...etc...and you will end up feeling vastly alone and under accomplished. You see people with amazing skill sets you will never possess. You see friends laughing and collaborating on pranks together. You see astoundingly awesome places you will never visit. You end up feeling trapped and alone.  You feel isolated and unworthy to venture out and attempt...""life"". Social media has brought the entire world up close and I don't think it's supposed to be like that. You're immediately compared to thousands of people all over the planet and you get to witness ""first hand"" just how small and truly insignificant you really are. You feel even more alone than you were before. You feel absolutely  stunted in your life's journey. Stop and think about how social media is damaging you. Sure...it's entertaining, short term. It fills the void of boredom. However, afterwards and over time....it depends your emotional wounds. You don't realize it's happening, so you keep going back for more. The dark shadow envelopes you. It's definitely something to contemplate.",unworthy-1,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn7eo5/social_mediadamaged/

i need to find a solution for my rapidly declining mental health.,"hey everyone, i never really post on here but i desperately need some way out of this. my mental state, for a few years, has been getting arguably worse, with a few jumps here and there, most of them occurring in the early months of the year (i.e : january to may 2020, january to may 2021, mid-february to early march 2022). aside from these small periods of peace, i lose a grip on everything : and every time that my mental state goes lower, it actually gets even worse. i've tried about every form of help possible, got hospitalized 3 times, tried three or four different meds, several therapists, and my ultimate move was moving across the country to radically change my environment - and it worked ! for about two weeks. the problem now is that my mental health, as of now, has gotten so tremendously bad, that i cannot even function anymore. i cannot carry a conversation without talking in depth about my trauma - i'm not even kidding, the first five minutes that i meet someone new or old i end up self-deprecating and/or mentioning the abuse i've endured. i have been for the past month unable to cook a single meal, not even pasta, i only live off uber eats and snacks and i just know it has probably severely affected my physical health but there is nothing i can do at this point. i am drained, in every way possible. and i think i hit rock bottom today, when i was trying to walk around the campus of the university i live next to, had an enormous panic attack where i could not move, ended up sitting down in front of a wall and started straight up hallucinating. i cannot do this anymore. the problem is that i do not have the strength nor the actual desire to kill myself, i just so desperately want to get better, but i'm at a point where i do not even see any option possible. i have developed a severe form of social anxiety that wasn't even the case beforehand, my self-hatred has gone up exponentially, and i have completely lost a grip on reality. i do not know what i can even do now. i will however be very clear on this : **no matter what happens, i am NOT setting foot in a psychiatric facility.** i would rather shit in my hands and clap with my mouth wide open than even think of going to the emergency room or whatever. i cannot, for my own emotional safety, afford to go there again - i cannot financially afford a therapist either, sadly.

so are there things that i can still do ? attempt ? seek ? i do not wish to kill myself, i am just scared that it'll be the only option out of this hellhole.

How steady-state is mood in depression?,"If you’re depressed, are the feelings there ALL the time, or do they come and go over the course of day or week?

I (30F) first fell into depression very abruptly in 4th grade, like someone flipped a switch.  After reaching a suicidal low point in high school, I upgraded to a “life isn’t great, but I don’t want to die” state.  I figured I was “cured” of depression and this is just how I am, with a low-grade constantly simmering sense of ennui that I could (usually) push to the sides.

Lately the ennui has bloomed into a deep, crushing existential dread.  I’m overall low energy and have lost interest in most everything, but for 70% of the day, it’s bearable and I can go about things normally (although, due to lack of interest, have begged off all activities other than work).  But I’m functional.  I am just blah.  Sometimes I can feel satisfied; today I felt pretty good this morning.  But then the other 30% of the day, I get hit by an all-consuming sense of hopelessness and cannot stop crying.  One minor thing will trigger it and it becomes a tsunami.  The existential dread becomes so terrible, I can almost feel it weighing on my chest, a lump in my throat that feels impossibly stuck.

I’ve just always assumed depression was where you felt terrible, all the time—if I were truly depressed, shouldn’t that weight hang heavy all the time?  Or is the blah-deep despair-blah wave riding typical?  My first depressive episode was so severe, I don’t know what is still depression, but just not as bad…",starship_egg,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn6xoq/how_steadystate_is_mood_in_depression/

"I’m so sick and tired of being self conscious, I hate myself for what I’ve become.","I’m only a 17 year old male and I’m going to college In a few months and I’m tired of my appearance. After my parents divorced early in life I got said and couldn’t get over it for years and years. That was when I started to turn to fucking food for my comfort. I hate myself for being weak and not holding myself back from the food. If I could have ten seconds alone with my past self I’d just scream at them to stop eating, go outside more and make more friends. I’ve gone to counseling now my entire high school career. I’m a senior now and I’ve never had a girlfriend since middle school, when we were dating I was big but I was confident and i actually didn’t care about my weight, but of course she was with another boy. 

When I got to high school a girl liked me, but I was too shy to talk to her when she tried to talk to me. I’m ashamed that my weight and my appearance has held me back from having any fun for the last 4 years. My counselor and I are such great friends and we talk about everything in his office, but once I step out of the office and go back home, I’m back in my shithole of a world. 

I have the perfect family to! Loving, caring and everything, so I realized it had nothing to do with them, but it was my selfishness and my idiocy. 

I finally have decided to walk. I’ve fallen off the wagon a couple of times but I managed to lose ten pounds. I no longer have body pains anymore, but I want results. I know nothing comes overnight but I’m crying as I’m writing this. All I want is a girl who will love me for who I am, and most importantly I’m tired of looking this way. I’m trying so hard to lose weight, I’ve been completely alone my entire high school experience, very few friends, the ones I used to have either moved away, are homeschooled, or we don’t see each-other since our classes and lunch shifts switch. My counselor told me that I need to live on campus In college which I’ve decided to do in order to interact with others because I’ve “already suffered long enough” in high school being so isolated. And it’s all because of my weight, I hold myself back from everything, even speaking. Today I didn’t have to speak throughout the entire day. I didn’t say a word to anyone except me talking to myself. I’m too afraid to do anything because I see all these fit guys and good looking people, thinking they’ll judge me. 

I wear a jacket everyday over my shirt to hide the obvious fact I’m overweight. Even in the summer I wear it, I’m too scared to simply walk open with just a shirt on, I always hide my body with a jacket. I’m tired of being this way, I want help and if I could have one wish granted to me, I wouldn’t wish it on ending world hunger or anything, I’d wish it on me losing all my weight. That’s how bad it is... 

I don’t want to go into college a fat nobody, I’ve told myself in middle school “you’re not going into high school a fatass” then I told myself, you’re not going to look this this sophomore year, then junior year, senior year, and now I’m telling myself college. I’m just thinking about starving myself to be honest. I’m just tired of being so self conscious and I want to be confident in my body. Every damn time I look in the mirror I cry, I can’t take it anymore, I’m sick of my weakness. 

I’m walking around my neighborhood and I’ve lost 10 pounds like I said, but I don’t notice anything, I’m still disgusting and ugly. I don’t want this life anymore. I had a job and saved up my money wisely. I WOULD spend ALL of my money I have saved up from my old job just to get a liposuction or something to remove the fat cells, I’m willing to spend all of my money to look better as soon as I turn 18 if I could.. but I can’t, and I have to go through this long tedious shitty process, but I don’t care, I’ll push myself through it everyday, I’ll eat the very minimum I can to survive and cry through it because I deserve the pain for making my life hell all throughout middle school and high school.

I'm turning 25 and feel like I've wasted my 20s,"I turn 25 in May with no degree, never had a girlfriend (no kiss or sex), and am broke after quitting with 2 weeks notice at a well-paying, full-time retail job last October. And being raised without a father or man in my life due to my mom's bad taste in men, I know next to nothing about manliness (cars, repairs, tools, assembly, sports, etc.). At the same time, she lives with me and I have to pay the bills and what not.

After four torturous, jobless months from fall through winter (i tried and failed other jobs), I got hired at another decent paying retail job and am hoping to go back to school for a Computer Science degree and to save money to move to Cali by 30 years old. 

However, I realize I've missed many milestones in my life. At 20, I was irresponsible and called off work at a new job so I had to work on my 21st birthday instead of celebrating by going out drinking (I don't drink anyway but still). The only success I have is having a job history, a car, a license (barely passed after failing the first time miserably). And at 23, I lost a bunch of weight/cut my hair and got attention from friends, family, coworkers, and women for the first time in my life. It felt great, but due to depression, I've regained the weight.

So, how do I course correct? Can I still have a kickass last half of my 20s, accomplish my goals, travel, have fun, and make memories? I just don't want to be in the same place at 30. By then, I would like to settle down. Thoughts?",Burst3001,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm9vfa/im_turning_25_and_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_20s/
Can I still turn my life around? Any advice welcome. Thank you.,"My young nephew came by today and asked if I wanted to go swimming with him. They often go swimming, and always ask me. I told him no, I didn’t really feel like it today. I say yes maybe one in ten times. I have a good time when I’m with them, but I never want to go, even when I say yes. I don’t want to go, but I want to want to go. It’s like that with everything. I don’t want to, but I want to want to.

I’ve lived a long life already. I’m turning thirty soon. But looking back at my life, I’ve done nothing worth mentioning. I haven’t really lived, at all, and life has just passed me by. I’ve been misserable at times, and sometimes I’ve been doing okay, but mostly I’ve just been numb in a way. I don’t think I’ve ever really been okay – even at the times when I feel okay.

My childhood was good. Probably my only good chapter in life, thus far. Things turned sour as a teenager, but I still managed to get through school, although poorly, and eventually got a job somehow. I worked for several years, but life weighed down on me, and it got harder and harder. I struggled focusing and procastinated things till the point I could no longer do my job properly. I quit. I initially planned a to off myself, my go-to plan in life in case things turned too sour, but I never did.

I’ve tried so many times to turn things around, but nothing has stuck. I feel unable to change anything. I’ve tried so many things, read so many guides and advice, gotten hopeful and really tried my best, but I’ve always just returned to my usual state of mind and way of life. I’m in an eternal rut.

I’ve been unemployed for years now. I pretty much just gave up and laid down to rot away. The way back – the mountain ahead of me, it’s just too massive. But even if I manage to start climbing, I’ll just be as miserable as I was before. I don’t know. I feel like I’m damaged goods, unable to change anything about myself. I think the depression that has been a part of me has changed me permanently at this point.

The apathy is the worst. And the procastination and lack of focus. I feel unable to do anything at all. Zero motivation, and worse, zero discipline. I wish I could do things. I wish I had goals and worked torwards those goals. I wish I could focus and read books, clean up, make things, finish projects, etc. Just anything. I don't feel like picking up the spoon to eat my dinner most days.

I’ve never seeked help. I’ve never been on medication. I feel like a fraud thinking I need help. I’ve just been drifting along in limbo, feeling numb, and letting life fly me by. I need to make a real effort, I need to really try, something, anything. What should I do to?

My biggest fear is that, if I eventually figure it out somehow, is that the thought of me already being so old, the thought of it being way too late, will haunt me and drag me back down. If I find the cure, I will hate myself for not finding it 5, 10 or 15 years ago.

It sounds worse than it is, I think. I don’t feel good writing this, but I’m not always miserable. I’m okay, and I have good days. I just wish I was happier more often, or happy for real, I suppose. I need to change and live life.

"Everyone can ignore this, I just need to rant.","I have absolutely nothing except my daughter. She is the only reason I’ve not killed myself at this point, but she is also somewhat the reason I want to.

It’s a horrible thing to say, but I don’t mean her actions or anything about her make me want to die. I’m stuck with a man that I know cares nothing about me anymore because I know how upset she would be if she couldn’t see her dad anymore. I feel too selfish taking her away from a person that makes her so happy.

I’m also stuck due to money, or lack thereof. I’m in online classes full time and he works full time, so he is the only one that makes money for any of our bills, food, etc. I can’t leave school because I need to earn a degree so I could get a job that won’t merely break even with the costs of childcare. 

I know this man doesn’t love me or care for me anymore because he has told me so. Why? Because I’m too depressed and too much of a chore to deal with. I’ve done everything I possibly could to try and improve my mental health, including going to therapy and getting on antidepressants, but every time I feel like I’ve improved I am eventually proven wrong by an interaction between him and I. I will never be enough for him and, based off of the things he gets upset over, nobody ever will be. 

I’m never going to try at love again because of this relationship. It’s either be with him and keep our daughter happy or separate and be alone and destitute. I also can’t really kill myself because then I won’t be able to see my daughter grow up, and her father has told me if I kill myself he’ll only tell our daughter bad things about me, including that I was selfish and didn’t want my daughter as reasons for having killed myself.

I just can't move on with my life,"Long story short, I almost lost my mom to a surgery gone wrong in early December. That whole month was hell for me, having to sit around doing nothing as she fought for her life in the ER. I was almost completely alone during this. Partly my own fault, because I didn't want to bother my friends with such a heavy subject.

Skipping ahead to the present. It's almost April. My mom beat all odds and survived and is doing quite well! But I still feel stuck in that constant loop of negative thoughts. I'm so afraid of her dying. When it gets particularly bad I even think she did die and I'm making it up in my head that she survived.

It's been almost four months. I can't focus on my studies or getting a job or anything useful besides just existing. I tried to go back to college in person but the pandemic just made my agoraphobia worse and now I can't handle being in a closed room with 40 people, much less doing group work.

My girlfriend struggles with depression and I'm at a loss as to what to do.,"I'd like to begin this by saying that I'm pretty positive I don't have depression. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts at one point of my life, but they were situational, given by circumstances I was in. I'm saying this because I want to make it understood that I don't think I have ever had contact with actual depression before, so I apologize in advance if what I say is insensitive.

We haven't been together for a long time, only a couple of months. At first it was perfect, it was great. She seemed so happy while she was next to me, she seemed excited to see me. But after just a little time, she started being distant through text. Extremely distant. I didn't understand why, I thought she was losing interest in me. I have some abandonment issues from past relationships, so we had lots of fights during those moments.

It's so weird for me. Every time we're physically next to each other, every time we hang out, it's perfect. There's never a problem. After a little time she told me she was depressed and that she was taking medication but she had just started. We had a long talk about it and I thought everything was going to be okay. 

But it just got worse. She's the avoidant type, so she's always distant. I know I'm trying my best, but I can see that nothing I do can help her. Then, she started pushig me away slowly. At first it was just her telling herself that she's not good enough for me. She told me that she kind of wanted to make me hate her, that she was pushing me away and she couldn't control it. Three days ago she told me she wanted to take a break, that she was scared of the attachment, that she couldn't focus on me properly. I didn't know what to say. I was extremely hurt, but I accepted. It was supposed to be no contact, but she texted me herself, so I understand how conflicted she is about this.

I can tell she's not doing okay. I know she's trying her best to communicate, to talk, but she's so dry, she doesn't want to see me. Before, I thought it was something I did, now I know it's not because of me. But I can't help it, I feel useless. I feel like I'm hurting her even though I just want to help. I know she's pushing me away and it's hurting the both of us, but i also know she cares about me and she doesn't want to break up, even though she's not good at showing it. 

I honestly don't know what to do, how to manage this, both for myself and for her.",DogemeatTheDoge,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmjhwv/my_girlfriend_struggles_with_depression_and_im_at/
My parents keep trying to get me off of medications and it pisses me off,"Ever since I (20) started having mental health issues it seems like my parents have wanted me to get off of medications. They see them as “weak” and just talk about the side effects but they actually help me. I think my dad is doing it so that eventually he can force me into the military but fuck that.

They have a relationship with my therapist who had me sign some forms so he could “get information from them” which made me think that he tells them everything (they are patients of his) so I don’t really tell him shit I just go through the motions in my sessions. He also is pushing against medication.

I have just resorted to going back to lying about what medications I’m on so they will get off my back. I am also seeing another therapist soon and going to break off my current one which I am sure will lead to a whole argument.

It feels like my parents are just waiting for me to “get better” like I have a head cold or something. I’m already doing my best and personally don’t have anything against medications so I guess it’s time to leave them all in the dark…just like how things used to be.",thro-awawawawayyyyy,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tna0m1/my_parents_keep_trying_to_get_me_off_of/
Quit olanzapine cold turkey 4 months and has never been myself since then.,"Hello!

Right now I am in complete despair, as I am in total disorientation, but I have a faint hope that one of you will be able to support and / or console me.

My story in a nutshell is this: four months ago I abruptly stopped taking Zyprexa because I thought I had not taken it long enough (only three weeks) and at a not too dangerous sub-therapeutic dose (2.5 mg) per day to tire myself with deprescribing. Unfortunately, three or four days after this risky maneuver, something suddenly switched in my head: since then, my personality seemed to dissolve without a trace, I stopped experiencing any emotions and enjoying my former hobbies. I just spend the last months in bed without getting out because of anhedonia, amotivation and apathy: it’s hard for me to mobilize myself just to take a glass of water.

The persistence of my symptoms terribly demoralizes me: it begins to seem to me that the instant termination of olanzapine could provoke some organic defects in my brain, such as damage to the nucleus accumbens... Do you think something similar could happen to me? Will I stay like this forever? Is my former self lost forever?",SnooCalculations236,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn9zvb/quit_olanzapine_cold_turkey_4_months_and_has/

I feel that I have no one to talk to,"My parents either dismiss my problems or turn them against me. My friends straight up ignore me, despite them telling me that they’re okay with me venting to them and despite me always trying to be there for them when they need it. My therapist is alright, but I have tendency to forget a lot of important subjects I wanted to talk about when I go to therapy, my mind just goes blank. Even when I remember things I just sugarcoat them and make them not to sound that bad, I don’t even know why. 

I just feel like I stopped having really any support except those 50 minutes a week that aren’t enough for me. I’m getting distant from all people I know and I’m just too tired to deal with all that things by myself. 

But I just decided that I’ll stop bothering anyone and try to talk things out only with my therapist, or just write posts that no one really reads lmao. I just feel sad, that I can’t even have a little support in my friends, even though I totally get why, I still feel so alone and that just no one cares about me.

Is this dumb?,Ok so around this time last year my friend and I started to have stupid little fights and overtime they gradually grew worse. By summer we had completely stopped talking which was a little bit strange because we had been incredibly close for the past 6 years or so and spent every minute of FaceTime with each other or just texting and then to suddenly not have that I realised how dependant I had become to that constant contact. As someone who suffers from depression it was always nice to have him there to talk to me. Over that summer I kind of was angry as it was a mutual “friend breakup” and neither of us actually seemed to care at the time but then as I grew to realise how much I relied on him (even reaching out to him) he didn’t seem to care and he was very happy with us never speaking again. So for a while instead of being sad about it I was mad because he wasn’t upset. It took a while but then in September I had some really hard stuff happen and I would normally turn to him while I was having a hard day but he wasn’t there and that’s when I finally began to realise how upset I was without him. If anyone else has ever been in a similar situation please let me know and I’d love to talk to you about it.

I don't remember the last time anyone did anything nice for me,"I'm so fucking tired. I've been working 14 hour days for the past two weeks, doing overtime work at my cleaning job to try and make ends meet and then studying at night to get this degree done.

I'm in pain and I'm tired. Every day is the same, I work so hard just to keep the lights on, a roof over our heads, and just enough food in the cupboards. And none of it is appreciated. Just complaints about the food being low quality and us never being able to go out and do anything fun.

It's been like this for years. I don't remember the last time anyone said anything nice to me or treated me kindly. I'm desperate for some affection and care, it's been so long since I've felt genuine emotional or physical warmth from another human being.

Being isolated has been messing with me a lot,"I usually just ""walk"" off being depressed and lonely. I'm currently in another country serving. Things have been hard for the past maybe two/three years. I don't have a very ""solid"" family yes they're not entirely scummy, evil, etc. But sometimes I tend to drink a lot while I'm out here, mainly because (I used to smoke to cope and well I can't) and sometimes it feels good to occasionally not be overthinking etc. Anyways whenever I call them they get worried for me instead of just be there and tend to go back to my mom saying oh she's drinking again as if people my age aren't going to bars and getting shitfaced.

Anyways that leads to my post. I try to make friends, I really do. In fact, I am always inviting people over, trying to create experiences etc. It's gonna sound fucked up because I have EXTREMELY low self-esteem but some people I'm ""semi"" close with say maybe it's because I am intimidating. I just don't know about that because the second anyone allows me to open up I literally divulge any and everything which is terrible and super embarrassing. It's like oh I haven't talked to a person other than casual work convos and I guess it feels good to talk? This year though I have learned to cut anything off that makes me feel more alone, a lot of people will intentionally make plans with me and cancel and it hurts because they'll go out and I just end up home because I don't have many friends, so I started just saying fuck it, I will be alone. It's been a very intimate journey, I hate it but I also am forcing myself to like it. (Sorry for the rant) I am getting a dog soon, I've been obsessing over a dog lately I think because it's going to feel amazing having something that wants to be around me as much as I want to be around them (corny I know) 

I just hate the feeling of having no other option. I put myself out there and get pushed away. I have two ""friends"" and they live thousands of miles away with their own lives. I know other people have worse problems but sometimes I don't know? I don't know what depression is supposed to feel like, I tend to talk to myself that's how alone I feel. I tend to call people crying when I do drink because it's the only time I let things out. I don't know maybe the dog is like my final solution. I do all my work and activities because I mean I'm in the military there's not really an option to say fuck it or you get sent to like court. So yep.

Why can’t I cry anymore?,"They say that the average man cries anywhere between 5-17 times a year, and other studies say as much as 22 times. I don’t know if I’ve reached either of those. Maybe I did in the past; I dunno. But at the very least since the start of the pandemic, I’m not sure if I’ve cried at all. Not really, anyway. 

I don’t think I’ve ever been good at crying. I know it’s good for me, and all, but I can’t even when I try. The last time I can vividly remember my crying, tho I assume and am pretty positive there’s probably other times, was in junior year of high school. I was sad or some girl or something. Can you imagine being so privileged that you can cry over a girl? I wish I could be that lucky again. Even then though, I remember I still had to make an effort. I could tell I needed to cry, and I knew it would take some work to make it happen. But still, at least it came out. 

It’s years later now and I am not positive that I have cried more than like twice or three times in these last two years. If even that… I can’t even remember them, i’m just guessing. Now, I’ve had every reason to cry for several weeks straight and I don’t. I just filled my midterm exam, I couldn’t have possibly gotten more than 15 out of 100 points, And my life is nothing but work, and on the news I can see that my delusional country is doing nothing but going to shit as rules block anyone from doing anything meaningful, and I am behind on my major, and I doubt I’ll be able to graduate in four years, and I have no motivations on what I want to major in anyway, and all I have to look forward to is being a slave to the machine, or dying in a ditch, and all of my friends barely know me, and they recently lost one of my biggest safe spaces, and even with all of that I can’t do anything to turn anything around. And I want to cry. But I can’t. I think I’ve been trying for like an hour, terms of been hit hard enough that my eyes are getting blurry and some droplets would come out. But I can’t make anything more than that. I just wanna cry. For like six minutes.

It’s taking everything I have not to just give up and let my academic record be destroyed. But I can’t keep doing this I need to let it out and I don’t know how.

I don’t care about anything anymore. I don’t want to see my friends. I don’t want to work. I don’t want to do anything I just want to quit. One of my friends quit. I wish she was here right now. I miss her.

I don’t even know who I could turn to. I think I need a therapist. But whenever I want to get one, how would I do it? I have to go through my mom. And she wants me to get one so bad. She never shuts up about it. I feel like if I tell her anything, I just prove everything right that she thinks about me but says she doesn’t.

I wonder if all that I'm doing and working for is even worth it. The future seems so uncertain and I just don't know where we'll be 10 years from now. 

I wonder a lot if someone like me, someone like us, can even make it in this world and be successful. It's so discouraging to take a look back at the last two years and see that not much has changed. Except maybe my rapidly declining physical and mental health. 

I'm not really sure I have the strength anymore, but I'm gonna take a big leap and put myself out there again, but better this time. If this last attempt to become successful fails and I'm in the same place next year I think I'm just gonna call it quits.  

I really hope I can make it work, I want to show others like me that there's hope, that it's possible to live the life we want. 

I know what it's like to not get up most days, to not have the will to eat, to have no one there for you,  to fall to the ground because your legs can't handle the weight of the world crushing down on you...

She was diagnosed with Kidney disease and was told her had ""a few weeks to a few months"" left to live but ""maybe longer if she got some medication""

She came back home and seemed to be making great progress. Was eating again, drinking again, grooming herself again... She was doing great. Then she stopped eating again.

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago, she couldn't walk anymore. She was too weak to even get off my bed. She'd just urinate on top her herself because she couldn't get up without collapsing.  


I had to take her in for the ""big visit"".  


I didn't even have enough money to get her ashes back because I spent so much money on the last vet visit.  


I got her shortly after the separation between myself and my (now) ex-wife because she got to keep our former cat and I find having a companion animal comforting..  I **needed** her to get me through my depression. Now, that I'm back on my feet and haven't had any suicidal or self harm thoughts for the first time in *years...* my little buddy that got me through the hardest times is now gone. No little chirping to remind me to come to bed when I've stayed up too late. No being woken up in the morning by little headbutts because my alarm has been going off for an hour.

I can barely find the strength to clean up the dishes I left around my apartment for her while she was sick. Can't find the strength to sweep up all the temptations I left for her when she wouldn't eat regular food and I was desperate to have her eat something. Can't find the strength to throw out her cat tree and scratch post.

Between my girlfriend and me we'll have about £45k deposit for a house and it should get us a nice 3 bed semi detached. I can have a garage to work on a project car and a nice home office. She can have a home gym.

Good ey? That's what everyone sees.


I just feel hollow behind the eyes. I don't feel real anymore, I feel like I have to act to be myself because I'm truly just miserable and nihilistic. A few things have contributed to it, and I have time to rattle them off if anyone cares to read.

About 6 months ago my girlfriend said guys at the gym hit on her - I'm a skinny guy, I'm insecure about it but I can't gain weight. She insists she finds me attractive but I'm self critical. One of these guys finds her on Instagram through a mutual acquaintance and processes to send messages about the things he wants to do to her. She brushes it off and doesn't tell me. It hurts that she didn't tell me. Eventually I find out because I see his page and she asks why I view his Instagram stories, which if nothing was going on she wouldn't have asked. She insists she ignored his advances and told him to stop, and blocks him. I insist on seeing the messages but they ""go missing"" when she unblocks him to show me. Whatever, I trust her, but still throughout all this she still goes gym 3 times a week, I'm filled with anxiety and nausea every time. 

I mention she should file a complaint and shes hesitant but does. Nothing comes of it. The rat is still allowed in the gym after literally sexually harassing people.

The raw emotive part of me wants to wait outside with a hammer and a few mates and just beat him, or gut him.

The other half of me is just fucking tired. I thought I'd found a good girl but now my guts off and my head just fucking spins. I truly believe she hasn't cheated, and I don't think she's reciprocated or anything, but it fucking hurts knowing she still hid it from me and there's no way I can be 100% sure. 

Part of me wants to threaten the gym into banning him, but realistically it's a fine legal line and Its too risky.

As I said, I like driving so that's what I've been doing. I've been driving 30-40 miles most nights with music on just hooning my car 110mph down back roads for the adrenaline rush because it feels amazing and I feel alive from it.

I wish I could just switch my fucking head off. This entire 6 month process has been played like chess with me delicately phrasing and constructing to try and seep information and I'm fed up. I wanna go back 6 months to when I was just happy before all this shit.

I had a therapist and I was doing CBT, but she wasnt any good and you can run rings around them. Waste of time and effort for me.

Should I cancel?,"Yesterday I was hanging out with a friend, we were having fun, drinking smoothies, watching some dudes take a piss in the park, talking about what antidepressants we’re currently on…

Then I asked her if she would like to smoke some weed with me next week or so. She told me she has respiratory problems, but she would totally like to try.

She didn’t tell me what’s up with her lungs. What if her depressed ass is trying to play it cool or like trying to impress me or sth. I mean I would do the exact same thing if I was her. 

Edibles are of the table cuz it’s her first time and I don’t want her to fucking die hahah.

Getting it all off my chest!,"The worst thing about this disease is how it makes you focus on all the darkness in your life. Everything thats ""wrong"" is magnified; it screams and yells and grabs your attention and refuses to let go.

I know there's good in my life. I know there are bright shining moments of pure joy and bliss...

But I can't see them because it's so dark. I can't hear them over the screaming in my head. These moments, fleeting as they may be, fall into the empty void where my soul should be and disappear.

And all Im left with it the wrong... the bad... the dark thoughts and ideas that fill my waking moments with dread and hunt my nightmares with such vigor.

I'm 44 now. Honestly, I'm not sure when the darkness took hold and refused to release me. It's been years now... decades...

I remember with perfect clarity an ex asking why I was so hateful and angry all the time?

I didn't have an answer. I knew I was broken, but didn't know why. I didn't understand it.

I remember being a child and my grandmother telling me I was just ""empty"" inside.

Can you imagine that? The woman who stepped up to raise me after my drug addict mother went to prison and my drug addict father disappeared on his most recent binge... The woman who chose to love and care for me, looking at me and seeing the hole, the void... and telling me with the utmost confidence it was there.

I think I was 11... maybe twelve...

So for at least 33years, this demon has hunted me. It's attached itself to me and refuses to let go. It sleeps sometimes... When I try, it slumbers. When I do, it retreats. Working out, listening to music, working on my passion projects, loving my wife... It doesn't like those moments. I sits in the dark corners of my mind, still, silent, waiting patiently for something to happen... waiting for the perfect moment to re-emerge and remind me that no matter what I do, it will always be here with me.

Its favorite thing is to don the guise of my addictions. The forms have changed throughout the years... At first it was video games, then it became the comfort of a womans body... When I came of age, it became gambling. That's its favorite. It loves to wait until I have money... until I have the chance to climb out of the financial whole I've dug for myself... Oh how patient it is...

And then it whispers.... ""This time will be different. This time... you'll win! I promise... You'll win and be able to pay off your debt AND keep some money in your pocket.""

I've felt that lie inside my head more times than I can count... and fell for it each and every fucking time.

My wife deserves a medal. She tries so hard... as hard I push her away... still she tries.

The demon hates her most. ""Look how plain she is!"" it screams. ""Look how overweight she is! You know you want one of those women you see when you watch porn or when you scroll through instagram... why cant she look like them? Why is she so lazy? Why is it so hard for her to workout and get fit? Who cares that she loves and adores you? Who cares that she will march through the gates of hell at your side? She's not sexy enough to be with you! Her love doesn't matter. Her loyalty is a lie! You can do better! You deserver better!""

But I don't.

Ten years she's been there, holding me when I cry, lifting me when I can't stand, telling me she's right here and isnt going anywhere. I know I don't deserve her. I don't deserve anyone really... not as damaged and broken as I am. Who deserves to be served a steaming pile of shit and made to believe its everything they ever wanted and need?

The kids... my god... those poor children.

The worst thing I could give my son is this disease. I see it growing in him as it did with me; the rage, the withdrawal, the frustration, the overwhelming feeling that something... that everything is wrong... that a part of you is broken, and unable to fix or control it.

The youngest of the boys wont even return my phone calls. He feels abandoned. He resides with his grandmother on the other side of the country and feels alone... unloved... unwanted...

The 16yo girl that sleeps in the other room gives me anxiety. There's no relationship there. We are at the same time too similar and too different. She sits in her room and watches the same videos and movies time and again. Or she comes into ours and insists we sit through back to back music videos featuring Korean boys that look like girls and lyrics I don't understand. ""But you should like it because I like it!"" she tells me. ""You should be passionate about it because I am!"" she begs.

My parents never did such a thing! They were too busy smoking crack to care about my interests or hobbies, so excuse the fuck outta me if I never learned how to be a parent that actually gives a shit.

I havent touched my wife in almost a month. She stares at me, eyes filled with resentment... My mind has been so completely infected by the darkness, my body no longer gets excited. Her naked frame walking through the room fills me with regret. There were so many others... how sexy they were. How delightfully enticing. Two were actually fitness models. I stalk them on social media and remember the feel of their skin. I close my eyes and remember the sight of them beneath me, on top of me, before me... so eager to please...

I look at my wife and wonder ""Why you?""

I know the answer; she found me broken and tried her best to put me back together. She tries still, like a house of cards, so fragile and weak... She spends so much time and so much effort building me up, loving me, helping me, encouraging me, caring about me... and with one whisper from the darkness... it all comes crashing down around her.

And she takes a breath and starts over again.

God, its so unfair to her... to let her be so close to me when mentally, emotionally, and even now, physically, I'm an ocean away. And ocean of rage and regret, waves of sadness and anxiety crashing against crumpling shores, eroding my will and desire away, begging me to come... wade into the cold darkness... let it embrace you... let it consume you... there's peace here. Eternal everlasting peace. You don't have to hurt anymore. You don't have to suffer this pain, this torment... Just come and let the darkness take you... take your last breath... and give you peace.

""That's the cowards way out.""

That's what they say. And they are right... I am a coward. I bullet to the head would do it. A quick flick down the wrist with any of the box cutters in my garage. A stab of pain and then the eternal dark... It would be so easy...

But I'm afraid. I choose the long way out... a pack a day will get the job done... eventually. I can already feel my lungs struggling. The pain in my chest is undeniably. Especially when I run or even walk fast.

God, I used to be in such shape. Women would stare at my body. The demon was sure to take that away first. I tried to fight back. I spent over $1000 on workout equipment and set it all up in the backyard. I went hard almost everyday for a good while. I could see my abs again.

Then my wife walked into the room, fresh from a shower and the demon laughed. ""How silly you look, all muscle and tone, atop such a sloppy mass of flesh. Too bad she makes no effort to workout beside you.""

It was a lie of course. She tires. But the demon was so loud...

Fuck!

The meds don't help. Ive asked for the dosage to be upped twice now. My libido is gone. Porn is comedy. My wife in lingerie makes me sad.

I don't work. I started a business... It's falling. The last bit of money I made I donated at the casino.

That last session broke me, I think. My will to continue is a candle light in a wind storm. I can't handle another gust.

Im so broken. The darkness is so complete now... it hurts so much... I tried to cry but the tears wont come. I beat myself in the head and scream silently at least three times a day... more when I think about how deep the hole is now.

I don't know why I wrote this. Maybe I hope getting it out will help.

Maybe you'll understand.

But I feel more dead than ever, extremely passive, no energy, almost zero interest in conversations, and absolutely no desire to hang out with any co-workers after work. I just want to stay home and chill with family. I was the same most of my school life, I have friends but even after 15+ years of friendships, I still dread going out and hanging out with them, but they accept me as I am and I appreciate them for it, but it’s starting to bother me because I thought school and socializing wasn’t for me only to find out no matter where I am, I am the same dead person everywhere with zero interest to live life except when it’s summer and travelling time.

i hate myself,"I accidentally cheated on an assignment and feel awful.

I know cheated, regardless of my ignorant reasons, or intentions cheating is CHEATING.

I'm trying to use the fact it was an accident as an excuse but that really doesn't change anything, does it?

I cheated and the more i think about it the more i try and justify that it was a mistake, because apparently i'm somewhere above the rules where mistakes don't count

It was so stupid , how did i think that using real past question wasn't against the rules, i guess i just don't listen?!? Everyone else seemed to know, when i told someone else i'd done this they acted as if i was insane for even admitting it to them - telling me it was 1000000% cheating, I can't even explain the panic i felt. I. Can't. Believe. I. Cheated. Why. Did. I. Do. This.

I didn't even need to cheat, i literally was perfectly capable of doing it by myself. I'm just an idiot who thought that i'd found some cool resources to help me ughhhhh. I would do anything to undo it, looking back its like was i not even thinking?? Hind sight and all that i guess.

On top of that even tried to submit the document with just the answers i had before i found the past questions and started cheating, thinking maybe i'd get away with it, as if that just undid everything, in the end i didn't even submit anything because i felt so bad for cheating - this being my pitiful attempt to make things right, I still cannot believe i cheated, or tried to cheat, or accidentally tried to cheat I guess, since nothing was actually submitted - see i'm just making excused again.

I hate breaking rules and literally broke the biggest one. I don't even know if i turned myself in due to regret of what i did or fear of being caught and that just makes me feel even worse, would i even get in trouble for cheating when i submitted nothing? I don't even know.

As soon as i realised i turned myself in as soon as possible, but still just feel awful, I explained the whole situation and they were so understanding and helpful and lovely, but somehow it makes me feel worse, like i don't deserve the understanding. ignorance shouldn't be an excuse to do what i want.

After a nights sleep and a clear mind i realised it was just a mistake and thought that it was okay so tried my best to explain the whole thing, completely and honestly and felt good about it at the time but now it just feels like a cop out, i did what i did and saying again and again how it was a mistake doesn't change anything, maybe i was too nice to myself, maybe they just pitied me

i'm so anxious that i've thrown up 3 times today and it just gets worse and worse.

I posted that i'd cheated from finding the questions to a uni sub and they basically all said i'd get kicked out if the uni found out and i feel like i should. I cannot believe that i cheated. i have no idea why i cheated or why i thought using those questions was okay. I have no idea why even felt the need to use the questions, i have no idea how i didn't realise. Maybe they'd have been nicer if they knew it was a mistake, but i doubt it. I didn't think they'd believe my anyways and why should they, i don't think i'd believe me in anyone elses shoes . my mum insisted i tell the full story and explain how it was unintentional to the actual uni and i guess i should be very thankful for that because they actually did believe me completely , to my great surprise - at least at the end of the day honesty does pay off.

I'm trying to tell myself its okay, it was an accident, i have learnt from my actions but i still just feel like shit.

one second i think everything is fine and the next second i feel like the world is falling apart

I am so disappointed in myself, i don't feel like i even deserve a degree anymore, i really think i'm going to have to drop out because i really can't take the stress. I would in a heartbeat if it didn't let my parents down even more than i already have. I want a degree and really was enjoying my studies but of course i messed it all up - i can't have one thing going well for me, can i?

My mums trying to make me feel better, saying i'm blowing this out of all proportion and maybe i am but i just can't stop obsessing over the whole thing, all that time i spent LITERALLY cheating, thinking nothing of it, like i just wish i could go back to past me and scream in my face what i'm doing. HOW. WAS, I , SO, STUPID. i feel like such an idiot.

I guess this does seem like an over reaction but is just the straw that broke the camels back kind of thing, i was already going down and this just gave me a push.

I don't know how to move on from this, and i know to many this is going to sound absolutely insane but i just can't stop playing the entire thing over and over and over again in my head, i don't know if its even this incident that is the problem or if my brain just likes to over fixate, oof",OkPotato8689,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn7nli/i_hate_myself/

I’ve been struggling recently and realized I don’t really have anybody to talk to about it. I’m not good with groups. The last time I felt like a part of a community was when I was in a dance team, and my coach ended up kicking me out because of my conversion disorder. She wouldn’t even let me sit with the team during my friend and former teammates funeral. Over the past few years I’ve stopped talking to all my friends from the team because the memories hurt too much and because they still train with my coach. I miss them but I don’t want to make them pick sides so instead I just disappeared. It’s left me scared to bond with people, scared to be in groups. I leave myself out of group situations so that others can’t do it to me. I crave community, but I’m scared people dislike me or will leave me so I don’t even try.

Searching for a therapist,"I recently moved to a new city (Houston) a couple of months ago and would like to find a new therapist. I had one in my previous city who had some kind of mental breakdown and had to discontinue my care about six months ago(also, my previous psychiatrist killed himself in July of 2020). I have a new psychiatrist, but not a therapist. I am 56 and am wanting a therapist who is around my age. I want someone who has had the life experiences (like marriage, children, etc.) I have had. I have found many therapists on my insurance (United Healthcare), but most are young and while I'm sure they are good at their jobs, but I doubt they would be able to relate to the experiences I have had and the challenges I am facing. I have looked on the psychology today website and found some promising ones, but they are not on my insurance plan. I have resorted to going down the list of therapists on my insurance website and googling their picture to see how old they are. My insurance website says nothing about how many years they have been in practice or their age. Does anybody know of a way to search for a therapist by years of experience? I don't need to know their exact age, but I would like it to be somewhere near my own.",therealhouseofhale,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmupih/searching_for_a_therapist/

Sometimes I cry over people that don't even exist,"No, I obviously don't mean fictional characters. Sometimes I think my depression makes me delusional but I haven't brought this up to my psychiatrist.

In recent years I think I've become a maladaptive daydreamer; I just recently learned of it too. I saw that there's a sub for this but I'd like a more broad perspective on this and to see if my case is that isolated. I don’t see it as a coping mechanism and actually more of a really unhealthy longing because during my worst episodes, I only indulge further and further in fantasy and it becomes more and more unrealistic. It's like I have entirely different realities in my mind, and while logically I don't see or hear anything that isn't there, I somehow get emotionally attached and this is where it's unhealthy. 

For example, I've had a strained relationship with my family as a whole all my life. My mind makes up characters, in this case a caring and kind big brother. As a ways of coping I block my actual parents out of the picture completely, as if they never existed. I imagine that imaginary big brother drops out of school to take care of me and provide and other imaginations of truly being cared for as a whole and it makes me cry over it, even though this never fucking happened and no one like that exists.",yaksokhae,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn7a3f/sometimes_i_cry_over_people_that_dont_even_exist/
Does anyone else feel torn about wanting to d*e but doesn't want to make your loves ones sad?,"Quick background about me, nothing too unusual though:

-29 y/o unemployed (only have part time job last year)

-got bachelor degree in a field that's quite niche (in my country), tried to go for another degree but failed spectacularly due to anxiety attacks

-have depression since teenager

-my life is just a mess overall. I have art hobby, but it's also a source of my frustration and depression. So fck my life right 🙃


So anyway, basically what the title said. I'm pretty close with my family, especially with my mom. I have an autistic elder brother, whom I love too. I've been helping my mom taking care of my brother ever since I'm young. So it's kinda already ingrained in my brain that I'm his caretaker.

Now, with my life being such a mess, my most prominent frustration isn't actually about being scared to die, but the thought of making my family sad. If I kill myself, I can already picture how my mom will be driven crazy, how dissapointed and sad my dad will be. And then, what about my brother? If I die now, who will take care of him after parents got too old?

Yet at the same time, I'm so, so tired of this life. The life I was subjected into without my consent.

Right now, I feel like the most ungrateful, selfish, and despicable human being ever existed. Because it gets into a point where sometimes I fantasies about my family died in an accident, so that I can finally kill myself in peace. Not that I really want that to happen, but still, you guys got the idea.",zer0_pm,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn79oh/does_anyone_else_feel_torn_about_wanting_to_de/

I feel like I can't do anything right, like I've just wasted time in my career. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone, as my best friend passed away a few years ago. I feel lost and hopeless. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't have any hobbies, I feel like my personality is gone. I feel like a shell of my former self. Idk. I know I need to get back on meds, but trying to find a doctor right now sucks. I'm not even sure why I'm posting here. Maybe writing it out will help?",Notmyusername44,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn77d5/its_been_a_rough_few_weeks_and_i_just_feel_like_a/
My mind is broken,"I'm 24 years old, turning 25 soon in a few months. I live in constant dread. I have no passion, no goals, no special achievement in my life, and never been in a relationship. I don't know what I want nor what I'm doing in this so called life. Everything just feels exhausting. I cry myself to sleep everyday.

I also feel extremely disconnected from others. I don't fit in even though I try the hardest to be a decent human being. I try to treat others with kindness and respect, be a good listener, help people when they need my help, work hard, exercise on daily basis, take a good care of my appearance. But, no matter how hard I try to present myself at best, I still feel I don't fit in. I still feel empty, unworthy and unwanted.

I want to do something that I could be proud of, but no matter what I do, I still never feel I'm good enough even for myself. I crave for meaningful connection. I want to have someone to share and spend my days with, laugh with, cry with, share my handmade gifts with just to see smile on their face. Someone that feels like ""home"" because I've been feeling ""homeless"" all this time. I want to feel loved, cared for, and wanted for once. But it's like it's just this idea of meaningful connection that I have in my head. I can even barely hold a conversation, whenever I try to talk to someone, I feel extremely drained. I'm stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time.

I don't know, I just feel like I'm a failure human being and want to completely disappear. Thanks for reading my long rant, I don't have anywhere else to get my mind off.",ChokingOnFlowers-,48,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkve9h/my_mind_is_broken/
"If chemicals can change my thoughts and how I perceive things, how can I ever trust my own thoughts?","Depression, therapists, hospitals, meds, been there, done that.
I still consistently think the world is objectively awful, and I feel that forcing people to live in it when they didn't get a choice to be born is kind of cruel. I don't think that'll ever change.

I started smoking weed about a year ago, and I'm going to try psilocybin if I can. Weed helps me function, but I just feel like I'm manually controlling my level of neurotransmitters.

They don't deserve me being so shitty over their happiness...

Do things like drink enough water, some sort of exercise, journal, read, be on top of my university classes. But every time I fail. Ive had about 10 day ones and i barely make it to day 7 usually. 

And yea yea fail and get back up again blah blah practice makes perfect. I cant hear that anymore that doesnt help. Dont even get me started on “but this time it might work and you might feel better….keep trying” ….. yea that has been said like 6 times. 

Ive been through the whole just wait till you get to university…then wait until you move in with these new roommates….then oh those ones were just bad how about these new ones….then oh that job just sucked you will like this one much better…. and so on and so on. It NEVER works out.

I dont want to be so depressed and i know that technically yea taking care of myself and being positive and all that “helps”. far better than giving up. but i know i will fail in about 2 weeks anyway.

Sometimes I feel like a bad person then I stop caring,"So for context in the past week, I had my spring break for college. Prior I was dealing with some drama on the dorm floor that I wasn't really a part of but like most depressed people I'm the therapist friend so I got involved even though I honestly just wanna grab some popcorn and watch from the sidelines. Anyways, by the end of the week and as we were coming up on spring break I was honestly too emotionally exhausted to care about anything which is saying something because the Saturday of the start of spring break was my 19th birthday but I simply didn't care and I wasn't even going home, I was visiting my grandparents because my grandfather's birthday was 2 days after mine. Once I got there I basically kind of just set up shop in my bed. I had a pretty good time by myself. I wasn't happy but more of like a peaceful emotionally numb state that I'm totally complacent in. But I knew that I was probably making some of my family members upset cause I mostly just kept to myself and if I wasn't feeling great i'd excuse myself and go back to laying down and watching YouTube, or reading a comic, or whatever else I could do with my phone. My mom was semi upset because I was being antisocial. I don't hate my family. Sometimes they get on my nerves but what family doesn't do that. I just enjoy solitude and my own peace of mind. I viewed this as an opportunity to take a break from not only school but just a break from people which was honestly really needed. I feel bad because while I explain my mental health it can be a little hard to understand or be misinterpreted as me just not wanting to spend time with my family but in all honesty, I barely even recognized they were in the house I was just chilling and minding my own business. Idk why I'm saying this I was just wondering if anyone had to deal with something similar.",GodofLegends23,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmt7ne/sometimes_i_feel_like_a_bad_person_then_i_stop/

my ex gf accused me of trying to drug her and ghosted me. I have so many other problems too.,"I am a convicted felon. (narcotics possession)
In 2016 my dad died at 56 from cancer. Had 3 other relatives die from cancer before that.
I moved out of the apartment I shared with my ex fiance and moved back home after promising my dying dad I would look after my mom.
I learned way too much about the world, news, politics, economics, history, conspiracy theories, etc.
Got insanely depressed. Started using a lot of drugs.
My best friend sent me some crazy texts in 2018. I thought about going to check on him but laughed it off. Next day he was dead. Suicide by cop. I blamed myself.
My fiance of 6 years left me after that after some arguments.
I got involved with a girl my dead friend was friends with. We were depressed about his death and she got me on heroin.
She became my new gf and moved in with me.
We spiraled into drug addiction.
I got arrested many times.
She left me a year later for an abusive douche with money.
I spiraled into depression.
I immediately hooked up with her friend who was also an addict. She became my new gf.
She went to jail.
I went to jail for 7 months. 
While I was in jail my friend robbed me blind. Sold my vehicle and stole thousands of dollars worth of tools.
Got out right before Xmas 2019
Mother refused to let me come home until March 2020
That gf broke up with me and chose heroin over me after getting out due to COVID in March 2020.
I am on probation until 2025
I haven't been able to drive since July 15 2019 when I was thrown in jail.
I was alone and jobless, depressed about the pandemic from March 2020 until Sept 2020 when I met another girl at a party.
Told her I had no phone, no license, she gave me her email and number anyway.
Neighbor gave me a job the next day.
She picked me up a week later and went out.
Literally had more in common with her than anyone I have ever met.
We fell in love so hard it was crazy. I couldn't believe how lucky I was and she was cool with me living at home with no license.
Told her about my past early on. She had traumatic experiences with her older brother who was a drug addict.
I'm happy for the first time in YEARS with her.
Figure out that she takes a lot of mail-order Xanax and has an adderall prescription for her MS.
We smoke weed, drink together, take LSD sometimes. She gives me Xanax sometimes.
She found out that I tried to buy some coke from my buddy because my boss wanted some. He screenshotted that text and sent it to her for NO REASON.
Never mentioned it to me.
She starts acting very paranoid.
Loses her job working from home because it seems like she's scared to answer the phone.
Accuses me one night of smearing invisible drugs on the wall and absorbing them through my skin. Lots of other weird stuff too.
Constantly accuses me of doing heroin/meth/cocaine.
She goes through all the stuff in my workshop, finds 3 needles I forgot about a long time ago. Doesn't say anything.
Accuses me of putting drugs on the fridge door handle, and other crazy shit involving drugs that make no sense.
I buy a drug test and take it right in front of her and pass everything except for weed. She calmed down a bit.
2 days later my friend comes over for a beer after she left. He gives me 3 Xanax.
She finds out he came over and flips out on me.
Ghosts me for a week.
Texts me and accuses me of putting drugs in her lotion and her vape. Says I cheated on the urine test I took somehow.
Breaks up with me.
I try like hell to get her back for 2 months.
She comes back and tells me she thought I was breaking into her apartment and putting drugs in her wall and she spent hours chipping paint off her wall. Don't know what to say except that I would never do anything like that even if I was secretly on drugs and nobody else ever would.
Talking with her best friend constantly who also thinks shes losing it.
I realize she's really losing her mind.
For a week she's scared to come back in the house so we go out on dates and have sex in her car instead.
Things calm down I slowly convince her to come back inside and we're back together.
She admits she has a Xanax problem and we start going to NA meetings together for both of us.
One night we get back from an NA meeting and dinner together and she goes to the bathroom.
Comes out crying saying she can't stay over tonight because I'm re-grouting the tiles on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet and mixing drugs in the grout.
The floor was wet from condensation making the grout in front of the toilet look darker.
Have a huge talk about all of this. She said I'm trying to get her hooked on heroin.
Deny everything because it's obviously not true and try to explain things using logic. 
She says that because I used to be an addict I'm always going to want to do it again.
Finally calm her down and we go to bed.
Next morning I leave to go to work.
Walk down the street to my boss's house and wait for him for an hour. He's taking forever.
Wonder why she hasn't left my house yet.
Go back home and open the door and surprise her.
I walk into the bathroom and see that she's been squeezing out my toothpaste into the sink, also some of my shaving cream and cologne.
We go outside, talk like nothing happened, and she leaves.
Later I come back home after work and find that she was peeling some of the paint off my wall.
She comes back a few days later for her birthday and we had a good time, nothing weird happened.
Week later she ghosts me out of nowhere.
Heartbroken as hell again. After a few days of texting her my friend gives me some Xanax.
I take a Xanax bar to try to calm down and drink some beers, pass out on the basement floor.
My other friend drops by and calls an ambulance.
The ambulance shows up and my mom asks me if I'm trying to kill myself. Don't remember any of this.
I say if I wanted to die I'd already be dead.
That's all the paramedics needed to hear.
They take me to the hospital and lock me in a room for 2 days.
Then they take my phone away and take me to a psych ward.
I feel so heartbroken and depressed I wanna die but I hold it together and act like I'm ok.
After 10 days the psych Dr. diagnosed me with depression and clears me to leave.
My mother's house is my address, so they call her and tell her.
She tells them to keep me there because she's pissed that I did Xanax. Tells them to put me straight in a rehab.
I realize I'm fucked and my mother's abandoning me too and start thinking about killing myself as soon as I get out.
After 2 months locked in the psych ward she finally agrees to let me come home.
Mom picks me up.
Get my phone back, try to get in touch with my gf that I'm literally dying over.
No answer.
I lay down in bed for 2 weeks.
Boss finally lets me come back to work.
I get in touch with ex's best friend (lets call her ann and call my ex sarah)
Ann says Sarah ghosted her too a week after I got hospitalized because she found out that she did coke with her ex bf a few times.
Ann gets in touch with Sarah's daughter and her daughter says her mom is very sick.
Says Sarah is destroying the furniture and stuff in their apartment looking for drugs that I planted there, even cutting pillows open.
Says if we try to go over there to see her mom she'll call the cops.
I am devastated.
Ann keeps trying to get in touch with my ex Sarah through her daughter.
Daughter says she's crazy and she thinks it's all really happening and she's moving out and removing herself from the situation.
I start texting her and writing long emails and letters pouring my heart out to her.
No answer for over 7 months since the breakup.
I am in hell everyday, overthinking, heartbroken hell to the point where I have dreams about it. I drove her crazy by being an idiot.
Worst breakup of my life and I STILL can't drive yet.
Probation found out I was in the psych ward and they are making me jump through 1000 extra hoops.
I will never have another gf that I have that much in common with and she hates me and thinks I want to poison her.
I see no future other than working like a blue-collar slave until I die in a world where I can't trust anyone anymore, not even my own mother, and society is going to shit.
The love of my life is gone forever and it's all MY FAULT for being a scumbag drug user.

I feel like something less than one.

I was in severe pain for most of my life and even now that I'm medicated I still get debilitating flare ups. People don't bother to check up on me anymore. It used to embarrass me when people worried. Now the complete lack of concern sort of feels like a confirmation of my own fears that I live untethered to the world. Yesterday I sat for hours on my bathroom floor and tried to breathe despite my pain and listened to my friends clinking glasses downstairs. I went to my bedroom without saying anything with the trash bin so I didn't hog the restroom. I realized I'd just drag the scene down. The best thing I can be in people's lives is a house. A free lunch. A good employee. A therapist. A fuck. A paid bill. I've tried to talk about it but it usually just ends badly and makes people avoid or chastise me for being a downer.

Better Understanding My Sibiling's Depression,"Hi everyone - I recently learned that my sister has been diagnosed (or was already diagnosed) with clinical depression.  I will be the first to admit that other than generalized knowledge, I do not know much out depression or its effects on people (I've been slowly learning more about it).

Over the last few months, things have went downhill pretty fast.  For starters, my sister and mom got into a significant fight which has strained there relationship.  As a result, I have noticed that my sister has started to significantly isolate herself from the family (and possibly her friends).  My mom cannot seem to understand the impact depression is having on my sister and expects my sister to act/think in a rational manner (i.e. she thinks my sister can self-motivate herself).  This is only further damaging the situation.  

This has been evident because over the last few weeks, my sister has isolated herself even more and it is evident that she is going through a really tough time.  I would really appreciate any advice (and/or reading material suggestions) regarding what I can do to (1) show support to my sister without being overbearing and (2) help my mom understand what my sister is going through.

This is sort of an anxiety/depression question. Does anyone else find it impossible to forgive somebody who has caused you significant trauma?,"It's a common goal amongst people with anxiety and depression to want to find the source of thier discomfort. I'll keep it on the shorter side bit I recently identified the primary source of my separation anxiety as comming from a friend of the family. She's no friend of mine but rather my mother's. When my mom used to leave me in her and her then husband's care. They'd find it hilarious to tell me that my mom called and said she's not comming back. I was no older than 5 and I used to completely break down. They'd find this funny until my breakdown wouldn't stop and then they'd quickly switch to annoyed. 
When I finally put together that this was my earliest memory of feeling abandoned and venerable, I thought ""great! I can finally let this go!"". Since then it's only made me angry. Had I brought this up to the lady she'd have likely gas lighted as she's since proven to be a literal narcissist and to top it off, she died 6 years ago. 

Any tips on how to get passed this? It's a waste of my time but it still eats at me.

im so fucking depressed i don't think i can do this shit anymore.  i've been thinking about it for years but i think i'm ready to try again .  i can't really deal with my family,  i feel like i'm just a problem to them.  i'm in love with someone but i don't think i'll ever really be happy.   i want her to grow and prosper and if i'm like this constantly,   she won't be able to be happy.  same with my ex,  all he did was worry about me so he left.  i used to be in an instagram community for a really long time and all the boys wanted me to cut and starve myself for them.  i became used to this and thought it was fine.  im tempted to cut so deep that i hit bone but i just have blunt kitchen knives in my drawers and other hidden places in my house.  i've been dealing with shit for years now and it seems nothing is getting better.  i'm so fucking tired.  im just creating more problems for my mom and dad.  Rehab didn't help,  residential didn't help.  all the medications i was forced to take,  the counselors i had to talk to.. the mental hospital.  telling my family i can't do shit anymore.  im constantly on edge and im tired. i do not want to live this life anymore but i can't escape it.  what the fuck do i even do at this point.",Economy_Schedule3496,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn4aus/no_point_in_going_on/
nearly everyone I meet online thinks I'm much older than I am,"I don't know if it's my way of speaking, humour or general view of the world, but I'm fairly certain my depression is the at the root. I'm 22, and most my friends are in their early 30s to mid 40s. Even my first girlfriend was 9 years older than me (it was last year, so it's not a creepy age difference).

I don't really know people my age, only 2, and we don't have a lot in common. We get along well enough but generally I just get along better with people about 7 years older than me, we form a better connection. I feel very alone, it's like I'm too old for my generation but too young for my friends' generation.

I have no place in the universe, which to me is stupid to say or think about myself considering I don't believe in a purpose or reason for existence.

I can't take it anymore.,"For the past 3 years I've been put under constant pressure at home and school, some nights I'd cry having no idea why, then came one day where the girl of my dreams rejected me things got worse a whole lot from there, the girl wouldn't keep her mouth shut and told her friends I like her and her friends spread the word around the school, people gave me dirty looks I don't know why however. Whenever I ask my parents to go to therapy they act like I'm just being overdramatic. The social pressure I'm getting from school is bad people treat me terribly after asking out my crush who's friends spread fake rumors about me.

Asking for advice to overcome a certain mindset,"Due to an overly detached method of parenthood and an emotionally abused childhood, I grew up trying to be the perfect child while undermining all of my emotions. I was never praised for my achievements (of which I have many, I know it sounds arrogant but this is only for context) just told to do even better next time and if I failed, I would receive the verbal lashing of a lifetime.

19 years later, I am a selfish cynical who is afraid of emotional intimacy and uncomfortable with physical touch. To make things even more pathetic, lately, when I pretend to be mentally ill, it's oddly comforting. That's terrible isn't it?

Yet I crave for someone to understand me and love me, but due to my underdeveloped emotional intelligence, I can never put my feelings into words.

This has led me to be a faker. I can act friendly and even charming at times, but in truth I am very lonely. Because of this, any attractive person who shows me the least but of attention, I give my whole loyalty to them, in case of women I fall in ""love"" with them. 

And when these people undoubtedly get tired of me, I feel pathetic and get engulfed by the most useless emotion ever, self pity.

It's just a rambling of thoughts and these words don't have any proper structure to them but I really don't want to feel this way. Any advice?

when is a good time to tell a friend about being depressed?,"I talked to a friend today and almost told her when the topic came up, but I didn't want to make the situation awkward or anything. I also don't want to just text her everything out of nowhere. Do I just get drunk at the party tomorrow and get it over with? Do I just tell her one day after school? I've told one person in my entire life and that was after a long motherfucking talk at 3am, so that's different. Not an option here.

fighting the insidious urge to end it,"Depression is riding me hard this week. I keep telling myself I have good reasons to be depressed. I just got laid off from a job I thought would last me through retirement. I got one month of severance, and I have savings, so we can last 2 months total before we're homeless. I'm in the 4th week of being unemployed with no prospects in sight. My bosses effing screwed me. I worked for a pair of entrepreneurs who had a couple startups. They shut down their companies simultaneously. I was the head of the marketing department. Which means I was the head of marketing for 2 companies that suddenly failed. Both companies were healthy as far as I knew. I had stats showing steady growth every single month. But because the owners decided to shut down out of the blue, on paper it looks like I oversaw the demise of 2 companies. On the same day. So, yeah, my career is in the toilet. Had 3 interviews, no offers, and tons of ghosting and rejection. I'm the sole support for 4 people, and I can't get a job in my field. 18 years of experience means I'm either way over qualified or too much trouble to take on. So I'm fighting that amidst feelings of hopelessness and failure and worthlessness. I'm failing everyone I love. We're going to end up homeless. 

Today, I found myself wondering just how fast I needed to be driving in order to guarantee dying in a car wreck. Because I want to find a way to end it that will be seen as an accident. I don't want my son to think it's his fault. So that's the only thing stopping me. Not my son; the problem of finding a way to make it look like an accident. I don't want to die...yet. But I'm so tired of trying and failing. And failing. And failing. This isn't the first time we've been this close to being homeless. This is the third time. How can I avoid feeling like a completely useless failure when this keeps happening? It must be me. I'm the one who keeps effing up. So the insidious thought raises its head. That maybe if I wasn't here to effing everything up, then everything would get better for everyone who depends on me. I'm so tired of failing. So tired of trying. There comes a point where you wonder why you're bothering to pick yourself up again. Why try so hard? Gonna fail no matter what. I've been here before. I keep ending up back here no matter how hard i try. So why am I trying at all?

""Get a job."" I'm effing trying. I've sent out 76 resumes.
""Get treatment."" 1, I no longer have insurance. 2, I'm already on Depression meds. Not helping.
""Can't you ask your family for help?"" No. My family is poor. My mom lives on my couch. I have no family to ask.
""What about unemployment payments? Government help."" Already on it. It's not enough to cover my rent. 
""Just give it time. You'll find a job."" Desperation shows. I'm likely to settle for ANY job. And I'll end up back where we started, not making enough to cover bills. I used to make decent money. Our life expenses matched that. I have obligations that cannot be avoided, period. I don't mean eating out and entertainment crap. Rent, cars, college, loans. I default on any of it, we're homeless. I just spent the last 5 years fixing my credit. In one month, all that work will be erased. Again. I’m just going to eff if up again, so why keep trying?
""Your family needs you."" Bullshit. My family depends on me to do EVERYTHING. And I'm the one effing everything up. They'd be better off if they stopped pretending that I'm dependable. Clearly, I'm not.

These are the arguments crashing through my brain. The crying jags are bad enough, but when you find yourself calmly wondering how to cause a car crash that'll be guaranteed to kill you...

Yeah. Effed up.

Depressed due to grades and it's getting worse everyday,"i'm a junior in hs, 16f. i always heard people say junior year was the worst but i'm doing horrible. especially mentally and academically, it feels like i'm getting stupider and my memory is getting worse. i don't retain information at all, but sometimes I think it's because I'm in all honors and AP classes and I was never as smart as the ""smart"" kids. everyone in my math class just sits there and... understands. they don't even need to ask questions, they just understand naturally and it makes me feel incredibly stupid. i feel like people think or me as dumb or slightly below average in intelligence and it's like a punch in the gut for me. also I want to study bio in college and sometimes I feel like I don't even deserve to due to my low intelligence. honestly I think its becoming an obsession.

i also feel exhausted every day which makes it to do homework so I get low test scores and missing assignments all the time. my parents (like many others) minimize my problems with mental health and grades and sleeping problems so I can't turn to them for help. and honestly sometimes i wonder if I'd just be better off commiting suicide instead of struggling just to end up failing at everything in life. I think there's many things inherently wrong with me, especially with my intelligence and personality, but when I tell my parents they just tell me I'm being ridiculous and get angry and frustrated. my friends too, a few of them have struggled with mental health but when I talk about mine they'll try to cheer me up but then if I'm silent the next day they don't ask. I don't think most of them really understand. I'm not that close with any of them though so maybe that's why.

another thing is I'm an easy target and I get picked on at my part time job which doesn't help with everything that's going on. part of the reason I even got one was so that i could drive, but one time I was feeling a mix of depression and anger from fighting with my dad and said that if I had a car I would drive into a tree, and now he doesn't want me to start driving. I feel like if I just got some help, and maybe medication, everything would get a little better but that's not a possibility for me. or I just wish someone in my life would give me some support y'know, so that's why I'm here",PoetCheap,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn2uts/depressed_due_to_grades_and_its_getting_worse/

Alittle bit of pre text; I already posted this on r/confessions and they referred me to this sub so apologies if you somehow saw both.

I know I know everyone goes through these things and they’re just a part of life for some people but I don’t know this time feels different. Before when these would happen I didn’t have many resources to reach out to but this time I do, but I don’t want to reach out. I’m in college right now and just found out I failed math for the 3rd time and now I’m going to be on my last try before the school shuts me out of the class. I’ve been trying to play it cool but it’s eating away at me. My girlfriend is off on a trip for a week so it’s just me alone with my thoughts in our apartment and I just don’t know what to do. The free therapy counselor for our school is closed until next week(when the term starts back up) and I don’t want to bother my girlfriend or any of my friends(lord knows I go to them too often when I’m having trouble). 
I’m really short on money so I can’t go and do anything fun right now so I just sit in my room jack off, play video games, and not eat much. I’m fucking miserable and I feel like the ground I’m standing on is crumbling.

I talked to my therapist today and I realized that I didn’t plan to live too long,"tw: suicide

Yea so my recent symptom of depression was that I thought I was really really old (I’m 23 lol). There were numerous occasions where I had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain was certain I’m 25 or 26, had to count years from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that I’m 23. I thought most of it was because I’m seeing a lot of successful people on social media younger than me and because I’m not finished with my uni yet, because I’m repeating a year. 

But during therapy today I realized that beyond those reasons I also had this subconscious plan in my head that I will barely make it past 30. Like 35 tops and then I will be dead. I have no idea where it came from. I’m not suicidal, I don’t think I ever was. But my brain seems convinced that by the time I’m 30 I will develop suicidal thoughts, and then before 35 I will kill myself. 

No wonder I thought I was so old. I have a little more than 10 years before my “deadline” lol and that’s being generous. 

Idk why I wrote this, I will probably delete this later. I just needed to dump this info somewhere, I don’t want to worry my friends and family.",chaotic_ostrich,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tly8hf/i_talked_to_my_therapist_today_and_i_realized/

I think that i'm lost in my own head,"So basically for 5 months now (i still had depression before that but let me explain) i've been having these panic attacks after midnight and even if i don't have them i have to listen to ASMR 24/7 because my heart always beats as fast as if i just stopped running. I hate it and i have this weird feeling in my stomack as if i'm about to have a math test. On top of that i have mental breakdowns at least once a day. I feel uncomfortable around people, especially men, also i haven't gone to school in a week. I somehow manage to hide all of that and nobody notices anything suspicious. I go to therapy but it's because my grades dropped from the highest in the class to just Fs in every subject. I also have horrible anxiety everytime i see a person if it's not my best friend. I wanna die. I wanna beat myself up, i wanna burn myself, i wanna shoot myself, everything stresses me out. Even youtube and music isn't distracting anymore.

I am so tired of myself.,"I’m sorry for writing this, feel free to ignore it. I’m just going through a lot and needed to get it out somewhere.

I’ve had depression for 9 years. It just keeps getting worse. I seriously lack the strength to keep up.

I’m barely making it through college. I do all of my work last minute and only show up when I have to. I think I’m failing one of my classes — there’s an assignment due almost every day and I can’t bring myself to complete all of them.

I quit my job in order to focus on college. I run a small business at home but nobody thinks it’s real or legit. Now everyone is getting onto me for being unemployed. I’m constantly reminded that I’m not working hard enough, that I need to get a “real” job, etc. It feels like nothing I do is ever good enough.

If I’m not talking enough, my friends and family get put off. If I talk too much, then they get annoyed. I’m seriously considering just not opening my mouth or approaching anyone ever again and locking myself in my room. I’ll probably lose all of them, but at this point, I don’t know what else to do. I’m gonna get blamed and criticized regardless — at least then I’ll deserve it.

I’m aware that I’m doing the bare minimum and that’s not okay. But the fact that I’m doing the bare minimum is crazy enough. I have no energy, but somehow keep up with my hygiene and get out of bed every day — that’s an accomplishment, for me at least. My doctors’ insist on “waiting it out” and I feel like everyone thinks I’m making it up. The only time I cry is when I’m by myself because I can’t bring myself to vent to the same people telling me to get over myself.

I think I’m gonna give myself another year. If I truly don’t feel better, I’ll know that I spent a decade with this atrocity of an illness doing the best that I could. At least I can set myself free with that in mind.

Thanks for reading, if you did. Maybe this will resonate with someone, or inspire someone else to take it easy on someone they know.

How to get boyfriend to get help,"Hello everyone, I am pretty worried about my boyfriend, the pandemic and self-isolating hit him very hard and from my point of view he seems depressed. He had these tendencies already before the pandemic but now it is worse. He does not seem to see the problem or rather not feel 'worthy' to get any help. Instead he shuts me and everyone else out, the only emotion he sometimes lets out is anger and sometimes despair but with the world as a whole. But this is very rare. I can't help him, if I ask what I should do he just says 'nothing, I need to be left alone'. I am really worried about him, he shows many symptoms of depression, also physiological ones. How can I help,is there any way to get him to see that he might need help and definitely deserves it?

I’m tired of trying,"Everything I’ve ever done has all been in futility. I’ve wasted so much time on nothing. I’ve wasted so much time on wasting time. My life is a mess and I have nothing going for me. I hate myself and there’s never a moment where I’m the slightest bit happy. I wake up thinking about death, I go to sleep thinking about death, I dream about death. 

Everyone was right about me. I’m nothing and will be nothing. All ambition for my dreams is almost completely depleted, right alongside my will to live. 

I hate the apartment I live in. It’s disgusting. I’m too depressed to clean it. There’s trash everywhere. My dog makes it worse by pissing and shutting everywhere and knocking over trash cans while I’m asleep. It smells awful. My dishwasher doesn’t work. Half of the time my fridge doesn’t. So I have to doordash constantly, not only because the fridge but because I’m to depressed to cook. Which has made me gain a substantial amount of weight. I’ve gained 45 pounds since I’ve moved here to college. Which I’ve quit. 

I hate my relationship because I hate myself too much to even want to try. I’m just there. My girlfriend is also depressed and hates this place and doesn’t want to clean either. She never cleans her cat box. So her cat uses my clothes as a place to shit and piss. Now almost all of my clothes are ruined. I didn’t have many clothes before that because they all got stolen from the laundry mat. I have 2 pairs of underwear that I’ve been wearing for weeks. I only have two pairs of jeans I can wear to work. 

I hate my job. I’m a server at Applebees. I make very little money. Humans are just awful creatures when it comes to food service costumers. The only reason I still work there is because nearly all my co-workers are wonderful people. Which is the same reason everyone is working there. Everyone hates the work and pay, but we all enjoy each other immensely. 

I’m addicted to sleeping pills. I have been for the past 3 years. I take anywhere from 5 to 12 a night. When things are really bad I’ll take over 20. It’s probably ruined my liver and kidneys, but I haven’t really noticed anything different. No pain or anything. 

I can’t sleep at night. When I try I constantly lay there and hear noises. I have schizophrenia which makes it impossible to sleep if I’m not drugged out of my mind. I’m always scared that any minute someone is going to stab me or shoot me to death while I’m sleeping. So I hallucinate sounds like someone opening the front door or jiggling the door knob, or other things like that. Then if I do fall asleep I have horrible nightmares. 

All the time, every day, I hear the voices of my friends and family in distress saying “he’s killed himself/he’s shot himself/he’s hung himself/he’s missing” which is awful. These thoughts come to mind instead of me committing suicide. It’s the aftermath and affect it will have on the ones around me. It makes it so hard to concentrate on anything. 

I have a doctor, therapist, case worker, and career specialist. None of them have been able to help me. It’s because when I meet with them I act like everything is okay, there’s nothing wrong if they don’t ask. 

I’ve tried to find other jobs. I’ve been applying to at least 3 a week. But nothing. No emails no calls. Nothing. Only one job in the past 5 months had reached out. And it was a prison guard job that would be the first step in getting into the police force. Which was my plan B. My best friend is in the academy right now. 

The prison called me back and set up an interview. It was more of an interrogation but they said I still did very well and I felt like I did. They said after that they would decide if they would do the background check. 3 days later they said they would, which took 2 weeks. After that they asked me to come do a tour and see what everything is about. The other guards were shaking my hand and telling me it was good to have me there. They introduced me to some of the repeat offenders. I thought I had the job. 3 days later they said they were no longer were considering me. With no explanation. Which fucked me up and discouraged me even more than I already was. 

I can feel my bestfriend growing apart from me. We used to hangout almost everyday and send each other memes all the time. Now he leaves me on read and rarely responds. I went to the bar with him and he’s academy friends. They were all actually racist and I felt like they were only pretending to like me. 

I’m never excited for anything anymore. Haven’t been in years. I’ve lost all passion for anything. I haven’t played my guitars in months. I’ve always wanted to be a musician. More specifically the lead vocalist in a metal band. But that seems more and more impossible. I have the talent to, but no real way of achieving this goal. 

I sometimes go 4 days without showering. I try everyday to get someone to pick up my shift at work, and even offer the pay what little money I have. Just so I don’t have to go in. 

I haven’t talked to anyone in my family in a while. I don’t really want to. The only family member that I love really is my grandma. But I don’t really want to talk to her either. Just because I’m ashamed of who I become and it would kill her if she knew I was addicted to pills and started drinking. 

I hate my life. I don’t have the strength to do anything except wait until something falls in place, which nothing ever will. I want to die, but I’m scared of not existing.

studying for finals with depression,"Hi guys, so as the title states, I'll be having my finals in about 7 weeks and I have absolutely no idea how to get through this and how to not fail those exams. I have trouble with studying, often can't concentrate, got the habit of just going to sleep whenever I should be studying, not finding motivation for most things, including studying and when finally studying I fall into a depressive phase quite quickly.

I know I will fail those exams without studying and I have to study, but I have no idea how to accomplish this. So the question for you guys basically is how can I get through this and pass my finals?

&amp;#x200B;

For Info about my current state of mental health (idk if it's relevant but I'll just write it down in case it's important)

\- I have had depression for about 5 years now

\- I'm on medication (fluoxetine rn)

\- I am in therapy, but I am not sure if it really helps. but finding another place is quite hard because all therapy places are full

\- Additionally to depression I have OCD which probably is related to the depression but we are not sure yet

\- I've lost motivation for many things, the only thing that can motivate me often is my boyfriend, but I do not know how he could help me with my studying

Depression is killing me!,"I can't help but think I'm a worthless piece of shit, that I'm weak and useless, i hate that i think that way cause i don't have anyone in my life to care about me and love, to be there for me and tell me that it's going to be alright, no one seems to care about one another and that sucks.

I'm going through a lot, I've never talked about it with anyone but I'm so tired of having to deal with everything alone, I'm only 18 and it has been like this for at least the past 6 years, I'm tired of hoping it'll be okay as i get older when infact it has just been getting worse.

Paralysed by my Severe Depression,"Hello there 👋, first time posting on here as I have been a silent member of the group and only really comes on here to read others stories to relate to. But I think that this time I want to share my own story and just get it off my chest, because I have no where else to turn to anymore. I'm 23(M) from the UK, and I live with my parents, I'm unemployed, I don't even drive, and I don't have anything going on in my life anymore. I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for 5 years, but things have been really intense for the past 2-3 years now. I used to be so optimistic about life and wanted to do so many things with it like: explore different places, meet different people, create friendships and relationships, work and make money, and live life happily. I wanted to experience life to the best of my ability and just do something for myself to be happy and strive. Unfortunately, my life is just a waste of time and energy that is just waiting to die. These last few years have been really hard for me, on top of the pandemic and all the other bs, my depression was killing me inside and now I'm numb from it all, just a paralysed vessel with no soul to control it. This year alone, 3 months coming up to 4 months in and I've only left my house ONCE. Last year, I was only leaving my house to go to my therapy sessions twice a week for a little while, and sometimes I would go out with my mum to the shops but other than that I literally didn't go outside much. What the hell has happened to me?!? I have given up!! I no longer fight for my recovery, I have surrendered...
23 Years old with only one job I worked to my name that I didn't even complete, I don't even know how to drive or have my license, I didn't even complete my university degree (only did the first year), I have no friends, never had a relationship, never had sex, never even kissed a girl... My life is a complete mess and I am a MASSIVE FAILURE!
Why did I have to be born and why am I born in a life I have where I live under a roof, have food to eat, water to drink, a loving family, clothes, as well as all the luxuries that I do NOT deserve. There are people out there in the world who would kill or die to live in my life, live in this country, and live free, but there's me squandering this opportunity to live a better life.

Why can't I just die and give my life to someone who wants to live instead?
Why can't I sacrifice myself so someone can take my place and live better who will use this opportunity to live better?
Am I just an ungrateful prick?

I think my life is finished now, I think my time to die is slowly approaching and I want to just go over the edge. I am not looking for sympathy, I don't want to give myself any excuses for how my life has turned out. I just don't think I can live my life anymore and live on with a regret that will grow and grow every time I don't do something with my time on this planet. I hope you all live well and prosper, I wish everyone that suffers from mental illness peace and happiness. I hope one day you will all be blessed by life and fortune will smile upon you.

School Back In Action,"So in regards to the title, I dont know what to say.

Honestly school has been pretty much shit ever since I returned to school from distanced learning and probably if it weren't for Covid19 I would be transferring to different field of study or school.  
I like school, I like to learn but some things are pretty awful to force down the throat and usually resurface once school starts.

In context I'm studying graphics and design and we got this class where we just make websites or blender. Teacher gives us websites and things to make and we make them during 7 hours period. This is fine except that particular teacher is lazy with his job in toxic way. 

He gives us a task and then proceeds to turn music to high volume or watch some movies. He is also pretty insecure about his job so he constantly checks on you just to make remarks on your work which often feel irrelevant to the task. And when you actualy want help from him he gets angry yells at you gets into your seat and breaks your code making bloody mess of original problem and note that it still is unsolved. He will then proceed to send you on W3schools and youtube. This isn't that much to get on my mental health yet. Guy actually takes me down in front of teachers/students just for his own laughter. Usually those take downs are not so take downs as I find them stupid and reason with them using my wits even thought its futile but well we got 5 idiots to laugh for it phosho (for sure). Also the work I do there, I find it meaningless as we no longer learn anything, just rinse on actual basics we learnt. I don't even know whether these are basics as rest of things are pretty needed as well. 

I just feel depressed contrary to myself back during remote learning. I started to be cheery, creative, innovative, teamleading and a guy with a goal in mind. That guy got drowned back into water of depression once school started.

"24 male, who was broke and abused all his life","Hello,I don't know where to start...  I recently achieved something that I used to think would make me happy.  So in this small country, called Lithuania. People here are one of the most suicidal (especially males) in the world.

Everyone is mean, envious, poor.

I have a long history of depression - as a teen I was very skinny, had acne, 0 confidence, braces etc. Last year of high school I weighed 64kg at the height of 191cm. I've attempted suicide during that year, but failed. Had terrible grades, ran intentionally from classes, avoided social interaction. Then I discovered bodybuilding, first time ever witnessed a positive change in myself. By the end of that year I transformed myself, at least mentally, passed exams with flying colors to get free university education.

Got into computer science studies @ 2017. Learned some programming, but quickly realised university is terrible in terms of teaching programming. I went on a gap year, finished a programming course, got a diploma. I was full of happiness.. Until.. It took 20 months to find my first job. 20 months, I shit you not. With a portfolio, a REALLY decent resume (I wouldn't waste time here if that was not true). I got rejected 800 times, was broke all that timeframe, in debt. No social life, no girl friend, no beer, no nothing.

12 months in rejection - waking up every morning just to see push notifications on my phone with 5-15 emails ""thank you, other candidates were better"" I really REALLY broke down. So I decided to turn my sadness into rage. I worked for 7 months straight night in and out learning android. Through a lot of trial and error, struggle I wrote 60-70k lines of code and created a uber-like platform for handyman services. I was getting rejected from job applications through out the 7 month development proccess.This hurt like hell. I could not afford to fix my car through this time, get decent food for bodybuilding ambitions.

My father sells drugs and has been in prison. I had feelings for him for a few years, but due to his manipulative nature and financial/psychological abuse and neglect I broke down. I invested every bit of time to developing programing skills and working minimum wage job is fucking suicidal in this country - people get paid 3 euros an hour, which is like 600eur month - So during this denial of companies of me period I quickly climbed some debt as I took for living expenses.

20months from that diploma of IT courses, I finally got an initial job. The HR bitch unprofesionally laughed when I said i want the lowest sum of money in the job advertisement (just to maximize my chances). I worked for 6 months, witnesseed 7 people getting fired. It was a young ambitiuos Swiss fintech crypto startup with a ruthless CEO. After 6 months I dared to ask for a raise (which was planned by company after 9 months of work) I got fed with some bullshit that I'm young, still a student etc. But I knew my value, I knew fucktards can't be trusted. So I went out job hunting for a week with actual work experience under my belt. In span of 2 weeks, landed a job offer that was double (2k euro month after tax). Then I had to negotiate my way into getting counter offer in my company just to stay, and they were not too keen to provide it.

So, 1 month after raise a German powerhouse IT company finds me. Got headhunted, so as I was satisfied with current financials, decided that I'm gonna ask for maximum salary from the Germans. Which was 5k/month with contract possibility (but our relationship is I am an employee and will work for years), meaning 4k after tax. I accidently got the offer. Negotiated a few hundred extra due to lack of vacation, sick pay etc.

I went to the HR bitch that laughed at me. 1 month after doubling salary I said I think I'm leaving. The bitch is shook. Who's laughing now? :) .  Of course she attempted to feed me bullshit that I won't fit the job position requirements etc etc. But I did not give in.

So. Long story short.

I was broke, living on 200-300eur / month. I destroyed my life. Social life is lost, everything together with it. I thought I was gonna be happy once I achieve my ambitions. I was terribly wrong. I look back, and ask myself, what I was thinking, commiting myself in such suicidal, dangerous matter?

Today I work at Europe's 3rd highest revenue company. Making 4-5x average salary of Lithuania capital city. And I am not happy. I feel money is a terrible trap. I am furiuos because I had years of youth which are fucking wasted, I cannot control my anger, MENTAL health is destroyed, I am impulsive, impatient, untrusting people. I am furiuos that I had a awesome startup idea, it needed money for advertisements to start having purpose. It did got me to where I am, but that is not the point.

I have not been attending university since 2018, like I just go to exams and get rid of them. This is my last year, I am too lazy to write bachelor, I fucking hate hypocritical standpoint of university, ""that it produces valuable employees"" all the fake media shit, it drives me furious. But I negotiated that they would post a media article about my startup app (Still fuck them, this is as much an advertisement for them as it willl be for me.)So, I gave up bodybuilding /powerlifting after depression kicked in. Lost a lot of hard gained weight. I look like fucking shit, slim as a 24 yr old, but stronger than I look on the lifts.

I've never seen a psychologist, due to money problems. I pay my fucking taxes, so I should be entitled to mental help, but the again, it's not the world we live in, is it? Never took any sort of medication, even though I know depression can't be cured WITHOUT medication. I think powerlifting and bodybuilding helped me express the anger, but the amount that flows through me is enough to beat the living shit out of anyone that pisses me off.

I have many startup ideas that I am going to chase, so that's what keeps me alive. The thrill of success, but it must be rapid and massive. Currently own 2 apps. One of them was in 2nd place of trending, raking in 800 downdloads/day at this small country I live in. It comes with a lot of responsibility and knowledge, time commitment to develop things from scratch all alone. It places a lot of stress on me.

I feel guilty as I wasted minimum 20 months of youth chasing money and dreams to find myself unhappy and old.  I've always wanted to find like a cute girlfriend that would accept and understand who I am, never been in a relationship and feel as a loser + guilty at age of 24. Im 24 because I finished school @ 19 and gap year at uni.

To be honest I now get rejected on Tinder like the very same way companies rejected me 800 times until I broke through the ice. I can't take this fucking shit no more. This, that, university fucking tasks that are pathethic and useless.

I also live in a piece of shit apartment outside of town with degenerate neighbours. To be honest it's a box in a factory. I don't pay rent because I did persuade my mother to purchase it when I started studying. It's a one room flat with tragic sound isolation. This place is hell. But I pay 0 for it. Trying to persuade myself to stop saving money and go live a normal life even if that means paying 500-600euro/month for an apartment. It's like im addicted to making maximum money and progress in life, so badly that I feel like a slave.

TDLR

My depression is expressed in anger, cynical thinking, uncontrollable rage rather than weak sadness.

I have become mentally ill. Corrupt. Was once just a sweet young lad, now I broke bad like i'm the devil. More than success, I want to see the envy faces of those who belittled and betryared me, including my father, who left me intentionally, brought me pain and misery.I feel more than money I want power. This scares me. Wanting vengeance more than success. There is nothing wise in this.  


I am tired of eating bodybuilding foods and being limited to looking like shit due to shitty genetics (I have gained 30kg in lifetime of gym). Exhausted of eating piles of food from plastic boxes, seeing on social media how everyone looks normal and is not required to sit at home and force feed themselves. Will probably jump on steroids, because I feel like there's nothing to lose, but living life for a first time seems reasonable. This is EXTREMELY dangerous though with my current state of mind..

Advice I get that always makes me feel worse,"- “It’s okay to be a late bloomer”

No, it’s really not, I have a lot hinging on doing well right now and I’m not. There’s a point where it gets weird to not have done certain things and I’m rapidly approaching that. There’s just these invisible milestones that keep slipping away everyday. And it’s just frustrating consistently being behind, all major milestones of my life have been fucked up in some way, and I’m tired of trying only for me to still fail at them. I can’t do anything right.

- “You’re so young”

Sure. I’m 21, I’ve got time. It’s not like I don’t think I am. But why does that matter if I can’t do anything to fix it? If everything I’ve ever tried hasn’t worked? I’ve been depressed for over 7-8 years, it’s literally all I remember, it’s how I grew up. I don’t know anything other than this. I feel like I’m 50 already, I’m just so tired.

I just wish I didn’t have to feel like I’m wrong for being like this all the time. I wish it felt okay to be upset about this.

I can't shake this feeling. I feel so damn depressed. I cry silently in the shower, I cry silently at night. Most of the time idk why I do. It's not because of my job, even tho it is very draining. It's not because of my living situation. I hate this feeling. But I can't tell anyone because they'll just think I'm crazy or want to get out of working or just bringing attention to myself. I put on a damn good fake smile and laugh. I make everyone else around me happy and make sure they are good. While I silently stand here. Crying on the inside. I feel like I'm lost. No direction.

Everything feels like it’s a fog.,"I finally confronted my spouse over his mental health issues, his neglect of them, and the toll that it is taking on me. It was like opening the flood gates. I finally realized just how much I have been shoving down inside in an attempt to help him. My depression manifests in terrible sadness whereas his does in unrelenting anger. It seemed easier to hide the sad to control the anger than to let out the sad and have us both flounder. Wrong choice. I am now well beyond my breaking point and completely mentally and emotionally exhausted. I haven’t been taking care of my house at all, my personal hygiene is horrendous and I eat everything in sight just to fill the void. My supervisor raised his voice and it took everything I had not to just melt into a puddle of tears. He is cool and recognized his mistake and apologized immediately, but I am just so fragile in this moment. Everything just feels hazy and sad. Just utterly sad but also numb. Can you even feel sad and numb at the same time? It’s hard to truly articulate the emotions I am feeling, and the level of “done” I am experiencing with everything. I love my husband. He was very supportive and is being proactive in attempting to fix his mental health while also encouraging me to get help for mine. I am just currently very much in a state of disrepair. I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting here. I’ve posted to Reddit forums sparsely in the past over unrelated issues. I guess it just felt good to finally say these things to someone else in the world, even if I don’t know any of you. These issues can be very isolating.

tips for coping with the state of the world?,"I'm wondering if any of you guys have tips, I struggle a lot with thinking positively not because of internal circumstances but because the world is genuinely so fucked right now.

* the world gave up on COVID, and it's now being treated as a sink or swim scenario despite its variants still proving to be dangerous
* the climate crisis is unavoidable, Antarctica was recently 70 degrees above the average temperature
* inflation is making it nearly impossible to live on your own
* after all of these events, people no longer have empathy for one another and everyone has been driven apart more than brought together

is this depression or just me being clueless? /gen,"I liked to think that I'm a usually extraverted person. I didn't have problems talking business with strangers nor did I ever feel self-consious in crowds. This hasn't been a case since like some time. Like I started stuttering and lost all communication skills I had suddenly.  

Now I acknowledge I'm lazy, i don't have motivation to do things if there isn't competition, but ever since COVID (especiallyfrom October 2020) I've been feeling really down. Sad, guilt, tension and anxiety consume me. I skipped classes except for biology cuz I never really felt like studying online, could never concentrate. As a result, I think I did really bad in exams. Back to the point, I registered for a college that's not in my city and as a result, had to study online for 2 fucking years in a room alone, by myself, with just books and a screen for long 13-14 hour stretches. I would see my old school friends enjoying with their friends from new college (they registered in the same city so they went offline again shortly after some lockdown restrictions were lifted in March 2021).  

No one really called me, or tried to catch up, except for my best friend who did once(which I'm really thankful for). So in turn, I didn't really call them either because I'm a pussy.  

I've lost all interest and whenever I try to concentrate on anything, bad old memories resurface, I act irritated because of which ppl around me (my mom in particular) have said I'm arrogant, rude and it always feels like I radiate negativity. I don't really wanna tell them all this because I'm afraid their first reaction will be getting mad that I skipped classes (which they're correct for).  

I also don't feel like sleeping, even changed my sleep schedule like 14 times over 2 years and my diet is little but i eat a lot of chocolates cuz ppl say they can keep you happy. Tho I didn't really gain weight.

All I want is to be able to concentrate and be like i once used to be, productive and someone ppl think radiates positivity because it's all really draining on my mind. I did consider self-harm but i know better so that's never happening. I just wanna fight this. Not feel this way. I'm afraid of consequences of not studying, and that itself makes me less productive, that lingering tension whenever I sit on the desk to study. I just want to be free, happy, i don't wanna feel like a burden. I just wanna live like a reliable dude.

Of course I'm not going to, I'm too much of a pussy to even try it again, but I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm 15 turning 16 this year and I've accepted that this may be my last year to live. Ever since I was young, my brother's have been a massive issue. I grew up with a brother on the autism spectrum who was extremely violent to where he would punch holes in the wall and threaten to kill me all the time. One day he almost did. My other brother would put my other brother in a headlock and beat the shit out of him to stop him from being violent. Then there's me, having to grow up with that. Growing up I was always physically abused. In school I was severely bullied and my bullies genuinely tried to end my life and the teachers sat there and did nothing to stop it. It went on for a year when I finally had to switch schools because I would avoid school as much as possible. Then a couple years later when my 12th birthday finally hit, that was the last day I saw my dad. He didn't want to pay child support and abandoned me on my birthday. I haven't celebrated my birthday since. After that, more bullying, had to switch schools again. School has been stressing me out, all this mental damage from home, there's always arguing, fighting, home is a shit place for me, but I have nowhere else to go. I've been trying to find ways to distract myself, but I just can't. I try to find someone who'd actually want to be in a relationship with me, try to find someone who'd actually give a shit about me, I can't find anyone. No one ever messages me unless it's a streak on snapchat. The only time my phone goes off is when I get a Twitter notification or a snap streak. Plus I'm also having so many problems with myself mentally, I don't even know the cause of a lot of them. I don't know what's bothering me in that part. My mind is fucked, I'm fucked. I don't want to be alive, but I'm too afraid to attempt suicide again. Not to mention bad eating habits. The start of the year I was 93lbs. I basically live off of monster energy drinks because they help me feel something and recently I started smoking weed and I'm afraid that's gonna become an addiction. I should've been dead from years ago, the fact that I'm still alive genuinely confused people. I think this is my last year to live because at some point I'm gonna die of a heart attack or something from the energy drinks since I basically live off of them. It's like I'm playing chess, life has me checkmated every way imaginable. What do I do?",Interesting_Tea8017,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmss6t/i_have_no_escape/
I don't know my problem,"Since gaining consciousness, I've felt trapped. Nothing felt right about me. I have never been happy with myself. I try to act happy and joyful, because I know I don't deserve to feel that way. Every time I make someone happy, that happiness vanishes as soon as I feel it because I know this is just luck and I'm not capable of doing it. Sorry, my first language is not English, so I have a hard time finding the right words to put in the sentence. I feel like I was created to be made fun of. It makes sense because humiliation is one of my biggest fears, so it's more fun if I get made fun of. It hurts a lot, but I don't share anything that happens to me, because it's not worth anyone's time and energy. I have trapped myself in many things. My feelings are like a prison, my house is like a prison, my school is like a prison, everything is not right for me.

 

The worst thing about me is that I never lose hope, but I give up easily, so I make excuses for myself that things will go alright even though I do nothing. I have a bad attention span and a weak memory. I do everything wrong, even though I don't mean to mess up things, but I eventually do. All I want is to feel useful. All I want is just some kind of respect. Sharing my problems and emotions scares me because I think they are stupid, and I'm sure most of them are. I don't respect anyone or anything because I don't want to because I myself never got it. That's the next thing I hate about myself.

 

I'm selfish and I can't change it. I really don't want to be selfish, but it's my nature. No matter how much I try, I always fail. I just want to help people as much as I possibly can because I know what it feels like to not have someone to help you in need. I can't speak properly. Sometimes I can't say words that I have been saying for years properly. Everyone makes fun of me. For this reason, I don't want to talk to anyone. 

 

I'm really tall for my age. I mean, I am taller than most of the kids in my class, and I hate being this big. It just makes me a bigger target. I really really wish I was normal size, so fewer people would notice me, and even fewer people would know how stupid I am. I've never really had a true friend. I feel like the ones I have are just using me. My life is like that. I want to be alone, but I never am. I want to end my life, but I have hope that one day everything will turn upside down and my life will be happier, but what if it doesn't happen? What if I live to be old and realise that I was right and I should have ended it right here? Death is painful, and so is life. My life is dreadful for me. I don't know if I have depression. I don't know my problem.

It's been exhausting lately...,"Last year I thought it would go away. I thought it was just a phase. But it stayed, longer and longer and longer. I sleep thinking that tomorrow I'll feel better, but I didn't. I lost my appetite. I don't find my life right now meaningful or fulfilling. I lack the motivation to do things or sometimes I find it hard to focus. Some days, it gets hard to get up from bed. Sometimes I feel too much, sometimes I feel numb. I feel alone. I'm exhausted. I'm really tired. I cry a lot.

I want someone to be there for me, but I don't want to be a burden to my family and friends. I feel like I need to get through all of this myself. But, I want someone to hold me. Hugs would be nice.   
There's like a voice in my head that keeps on telling all of these negative things about myself. There's like a fog in my mind. I know there is light and hope on the other side, but I can't seem to see through the fog. My mind is eating me alive.

"A little over a week ago, I made a post going in-depth of why I have decided to commit unalive. Here is my progress so far."," 

***Original Post***

I    have diagnosed MDD, severe  anxiety and PTSD. Although I was  diagnosed   with MDD at the age of 9, i  was showing symptoms even  before then.

**I'm     at peace with this decision. I don't want sympathy, I don't want any    of  that. I also don't want people to try to talk me out of it. I  just   want people to talk to. I've never gotten anything in  life, so I  hope   that a few people will fulfill this dying wish.  Hopefully I can  find a   few other people that suffer from depression as  well, and  maybe I can   help somebody before I leave this world behind.**

My     entire life has been nothing but shit. I was born to an abusive and     alcoholic father, a psychotic mother, an overzealous grandmother, a     grandfather in the Klan, and an uncle who was just completely crazy.

The     older that I got, the worse that things became. My dad would hit me    and  call me horrific things, so to escape this reality, I got into     computers at just three years old, and this has been my escape until     recently.

At the age of six years     old, I started getting heavily bullied in school. I've always been a     kind and charitable person, and people either took advantage of me   until   I had nothing left to give them, or I was bullied violently by   other   kids.

My dad would do   really bad   things to me, he hit me in the head with a bad (age 9),   used his car to   tear down my treehouse (also age 9), chase me around   the house with a  BB  gun (age 10), try to stab me multiple times (age   11) on top of a lot  of  other things.

The   house my  dad  lived in was right next door and owned by my   grandparents. They  were  blind to everything that he did to me, said   his alcoholism and  drug  addiction was a sickness, and did everything   they could to  encourage  him, while ignoring all of my pleas for help   or even going as  far as to  punish me for telling them what he did to   me.

The   school system just   pretended they didn't even have a bullying problem   in their schools,   telling everybody I made it up because I had ADHD and   an overactive   imagination, going as far as to force me into special   needs classes in   the 7th and 8th grade.

Mom   ran   away from home when I was five and left me to fend all by myself.    When  I was 14, my mom took my dad to court over visitation rights, won    the  right to visit me, and basically kidnapped me after visiting her   the   second time. My mom, as I said, was psychotic, and my stepdad was     abusive just like my dad was. He didn't get quite as violent as my  real    dad did, but where my dad would only beat me when he was drunk,  my    stepdad would beat me constantly, saying I needed to 'toughen up'  and    shit like that.

However,  during    that time, I met my first and only ex. I met a girl there and  talked to    her for a few weeks before we started dating. I've always  been  Asexual,   but I've also always craved a relationship. Something  where I  can make   my partner breakfast in bed when they're sick, smack  them in  the head   with a pillow when they're not looking, build  pillow/blanket  forts  with,  watch cute shows for hours on end, etc.

We     dated for around three weeks. She held my hand, would pat my head,    play  with my hair, call me stupid and cute names, and even kissed me    one  time. A few weeks later, though, she just randomly came out and    said she  didn't want to date me anymore, and had found somebody else. I    was  traumatized by that, but my brain was still developing, so I    wasn't as  mentally fucked by it as I would have been later.

I     moved home when I was 15 and the same thing with my real dad started     again. I even had to drop out of my Senior year, because my sister   went   to prison, my dad had to take care of him, and I had to protect   my   two-year-old nephew from my dad when he blacked out. I'm a   pacifist, so   it usually involved him just kicking the shit out of me,   but it kept my   nephew alive, so I'd gladly do it again.

When     I was 17, my ex had been in a horrible car accident, and was   diagnosed   with Amnesia. However, I didn't find out until I was 20. I   added her  on  Facebook, told her who I was (she didn't remember me,   duh) and we  got  along great. After about a month of talking, she said   she needed a  new  computer to work from home, as this was the height  of  the vee-rus  (don't  want to get autoblocked for saying the word).  At  first, I went  to a guy  I frequented for computer parts on eBay,  but he  was out of  stock of  prebuilt computers at the time. So, of  course,  with me being  an absolute  moron, I said if she could drive  the hour to  come see me,  she could  have mine. She came and got it, we  talked for  around fifteen  minutes,  and she left.

The   very  next day,  she messaged me on Facebook, said that I was a   manipulative  psychopath,  and blocked me on everything. That pretty   much caused a  downward spiral  that I never truly came back from. Up   until that time, I  had spent my  life hoping I would find a   relationship, or even a  friendship (my  friendships never lasted for   more than two weeks, half  of the time  because they stabbed me in the   back, other half because  nobody ever  taught me how to talk to people).   After that, I just  started hoping that  maybe, just *maybe*, humanity wasn't as bad as I thought.

Then..     The thing in the east happened (word filter, so I'll give you a  hint,    it starts with Book Rain), and everybody showed just how much  of a    psychopath they were as a result, so I've just decided to..  Quit.

I'm    at peace with this  decision. I've already got everything planned out.    It will take  several weeks to get the handgun I ordered, but I've    already planned  it out in detail and length. I have no friends. I have    no family. The  only person that would know I was even gone would be my    employer,  and he would just assume I quit because my job completely    sucks.  Nobody will care when I'm gone, and the way that I've planned out    my  departure from this world, nobody will be traumatized by my death     either.

***New Post***

(1)

In    the past 1-2 weeks, I have gone through the proper channels to   purchase  a handgun, and have it delivered to a licensed FFL. (FFA? LFF?   LHF?  Something like that). The gun was actually delivered on Friday.   The  problem is, I do not have a Handgun Purchase Permit, or a  Concealed   Carry Permit yet. Either one of the two are required to  actually go  and  pick up the handgun I purchased.

I    lied on the website and told them that I had one, but I need physical    proof to actually go and retrieve it. I don't know how long they'll   hold  onto it for me, because I haven't called them or anything since   Friday.

(2)

One    thing that I have noticed is that the vast majority of people on   Reddit  have called all of this fake, and most of those people have even   gone  through to message me things such as ""follow through, pussy :)"",   ""no  balls"", ""cope"", and just other childish/vile shit. I'd say that  out  of  all of the people that have gone out of their way to message  me,  80% of  the people were messaging me things like that.

If    you've noticed, the previous posts are also gone. This is because the    hatred was starting to spill into the actual posts themselves, and no    matter how nice I was about it, every time I replied, I got a  response   similar to ""Fuck you"". One person actually went as far as  having the   police sent to my house for a welfare check. Figuring out  that I   probably had something revealing on my profile, I got a browser    extension to delete every single one of my posts and comments. The  last   few days have been nothing but me posting pictures of cars  because I'm   bored and have nothing else to do.

(3)

The    plan has pretty much stayed the same. The day that I get the handgun,  I   will let everybody that has been messaging me know that I have    retrieved it. I will also donate all of my money except for $50 to    charities. I have around $7,000 in my bank account. I won't donate    anything from credit.

The night    after, at around 3AM, I will drive about half of an hour away from my    home, to this highway section that has a bridge looking over a massive    river. I will park the car about a mile down the highway, walk the mile    back, and sit there for a while. I will check my phone to make sure   that  there are no people I have missed with the explanation, and I will   say  my final goodbyes. A lot of people have asked to be informed when   my  time has come, and I will fulfill this final wish.

Waiting    for no cars to be on the highway, I will lean over the edge, and pop    myself. I will fall off of the bridge, into the river, never to be  seen   again. Nobody has to be traumatized, nobody even has to know. The  only   family I have left is my uncle, who I haven't seen in a long  time, and I   had mentioned to him in the past that I was trying to  settle down in   Germany, so he will assume that's where I went (for  context, I live in   the United States).

(4)

Posting    the last post caused a lot of anger, so I will attempt to resolve  this   as best as I can, since the vast majority of people thought that I  was   posting this for attention, or for help. I will explain again  that I  am  at peace with this decision, and that I do not want  attention. The   people are keeping me occupied so that I don't go  insane, but nobody's   getting attached to me, which is exactly what I  wanted.

The   main reason for  these posts is to let other depressed people out there   know that they  are not alone. That they may be able to compare things   from their  lives to my own. However, instead of encouraging others to   follow the  same path that I am, I am here to show those people that they   have  reasons to live. If they don't, I can help them find reasons. So   far, I  have helped exactly 20 people, in DMs and private messages. The   goal I  would be content with was one, but since I've helped 20,   hopefully I  can help 200 more before my time comes.

The Sad Story Of My Life,"TRIGGER WARNING: For pretty much everything except for sexual abuse

So right off the bat, this is probably going to be long. So please bear with me; I’m not entirely sure what my point in posting this actually is. I guess I’m just trying to see what other people think and what they have to say on my experiences? Someone who can understand and empathize with my specific predicament and offer some much needed insight or something?

Now, a few things about me:
I was born in the early 90’s out in the sticks (relatively speaking). From the day I was born, I was plagued by medical issues. I had aggressive tumors around my spine, I had to have two back surgery to remove the tumors before I was even 2 years old (they grew back after the first surgery). I was also born with eyes so bad, had I not gotten proper treatment, I’d have eventually gone blind. After many problems in elementary school with classmates and teachers alike, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. It was so bad the doctors told my mom I’d be lucky to even be able to tie my own shoes as an adult;  and despite the fact that I live with chronic pain from my surgeries,  the autism has, bar none, been the single hardest part of my life. Let me explain. 

Growing up, my parents (though mostly my mother in context of this conversation) taught me many things. She helped me overcome and manage meltdowns by learning how to break down events that happened each day: at school, or at the store, or wherever we were, so I could work to understand what had happened to make me act the way I did and develop strategies to not let it bother me so bad and be better next time a similar situation would arise so I could function in normal society. 

She’s helped me grow to be strong and independent, but along the way, whether it was something she taught me directly, or if it was just something I picked up on from my surroundings, but from a very early age I knew that my condition was something to hide and keep secret from others. Something to only share with people whom you know can be trusted (and in this instance strangers on the Internet who (hopefully) pose no threat to me or my anonymity and privacy). Though, knowing my mother; it’s probably fair to assume that’s something else she taught me, to not let others know what was ‘wrong’ with me.

My father was only around on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) because he drove truck across the country; but even when he was home he would spend his time catching up on chores around the house, mowing our grass, going to my grandparents and mowing their several acres with them, catch up on sleep, relax. I can’t say I remember ever getting any real ‘play’ time, we’d spend time together when he was home watching TV together or I’d be playing by myself (also I’m an only child and I grew up in a neighborhood full of people in their 50’s and up whereas my parents were in their late twenties and early thirties, so there were no other kids in my area to speak of). My dad will admit as much today, but he didn’t really do much to ‘help’ me growing up, “that was all his mother” he’d say. Still, growing up, and even to this day he’s the ‘fun’ parent, he would come home from the road and bring me different things, and even to this day he’ll split scratch off ticket winnings with me and a bunch of other stuff like that. 

Though I would try to talk to both my parents about my problems, my dad would say something like “making friends gets easier as you get older.” Or he would give me ‘clever comebacks’, like next time someone calls me r*****ed say something like: let’s compare report cards and we’ll see who the r***** is’ - things that never worked when I’d try them. And my mom would tell me something like “you’re a big boy and big boys don’t cry”, or “each day is a fresh start.” She would especially try to emphasize this “fresh start” concept after summer break was coming to a close. 

I would spend a good chunk of my summers with my dad on the road, we went all over the country together; I’ve seen all but two states before I was 10, I got to see the world trade centers before 9/11, I’ve seen the Grand Canyon, I’ve seen the oceans on both sides of this country. It’s given me a great appreciation for just how big the world is and how small I am, and an incredible love for various cultures around the world and a deep desire to travel to experience them. 

Sadly, the summers never lasted forever, and eventually I’d need to go back to school. The “fresh start” my mom would preach to me every year back would prove to be wrong, each and every year, no matter how I try to get along with others, no matter how I’d try to reinvent myself or talk and act like everyone else to hopefully fit in, none of it mattered because I’m still ‘the freak’, ‘the alien’,  an ‘it’ rather than a ‘he’, and starting in middle school: ‘the r****d’, and ‘the f****t’ joined the roster of insults and names, even though I’m straight and dated girls in middle and high school. 

Now even though I kept my condition under wraps at school, not telling anyone, I seemingly didn’t need to tell anyone for them to all know there was something ‘off’ about me, and that something ‘wasn’t quite right’ with me. Try as I might, from the time I entered preschool, and almost all the way through elementary school, I was unable to make a single friend until I was 10 &amp; was already in the 5th grade. Up until then people either wanted nothing to do with me, or they were practically torturing me; no one cared, no one stood up for me, no one wanted to be my friend. 

I consider myself to have been essentially, completely alone for those first ten years of my life. The only people who kinda treated me right were my family, but aside from my grandmother, they all have no problem hitting and yelling and even screaming at me when I stepped out of line or they’d had enough: of  me, my ‘attitude’, or my ‘problems’ (autistic behavior). My dad even made a wooden paddle (with holes for your butt fat and everything) for my mom to hit me with when he was away during the week and unable to discipline me himself. 

Growing up in that environment, I started to wonder if the only reason my family ‘loved’ me was because we share blood and they are ‘obligated’ to love me. I felt like THE ENTIRE WORLD was against me, it even started to make me wonder: if god is real, why would he force me to live such a lonely and painful existence? The more I thought about this I realized that it’s only through human progression and advancements in the fields of science and medicine that are responsible for me being alive. If it had been up to ‘god’ - or another way of looking at it: the natural order of the world, without our interference; I would have likely died in infancy, just as ‘god’ intended. Now, I’m not a religious person, I’m agnostic; but it’s an interesting thought/observation for a child to come to in terms of the paradoxical nature of their existence; it’s quite the weight to bear from such a young age!

I could sit here and painfully recollect every thing that has been done to me by family members, fellow students, teachers, principals, babysitters, ‘friends’, coworkers, and even people I never directly interact with; seemingly every which direction I can think of short of the church (we never went and when I asked my mom about it once she said if anyone asked to just say we’re Protestant). I could list them all, but I’ll just pick a few of the ones that are especially vibrant in my memory, I’ll also try to go in some rough chronological order.

Now, I’m not sure if any of what I’m about to talk about is ‘traumatic’, because how does one go about defining what exactly is and is not ‘traumatic’? (Serious question, because I’m so emotionally disconnected/inept and idk if that’s my upbringing or my autism or a mix of the two that I have no idea how to tell) Idk how to say if something is traumatic; though I’ll usually belittle and disregard the idea in others when they say something is traumatic. I’ll say they’re being dramatic, or just ‘no it’s not’; but that’s mostly because I’ve been raised to ‘be tough’, and to me, people carrying on about how something is/was ‘traumatic’, and making a public display of it; idk it’s like they’re admitting to being weak. Which, if they had any sense they would realize is a bad idea because it invites others to kick you while you’re down. 

In pre-school, someone was celebrating their birthday with a pinyata; I had never seen one of these before, and I was unaware of what to do or what the ‘rules’ were about it. I managed to get a turn, it didn’t break, another kid got it opened; and when all the candy fell on the floor, I guess I assumed everyone would be nice and neat and orderly and things would get handed out. Naturally it was a bare-knuckle-free-for-all between about 20-25 four year olds. What did I do? I stood there, frozen, confused, unable to process what was happening; by the time I realized I could be doing the same as them, almost all the candy had been grabbed. I tried to grab something but I wasn’t quick enough and I ended up with nothing. I know this story sounds like it should be nothing, and in the grander scheme of things it is quite insignificant; but this is one of the earliest memories I have of something bad happening because of my autism and I think it sets the tone for what my life is. I was always a very sensitive child growing up, and this deeply upset me. I ended up crying at my desk, no one, not even the teachers offered to share or felt bad for me. I learned if I missed out when everyone else got theirs, then too bad for me; that’s my fault, do better next time. 

My mother would try to tell me “you’re a big boy now, and big boys don’t cry”, so more often than not I’d end up having an incident with another kid and would end up crying in a corner telling myself the same thing: “you’re a big boy, big boys don’t cry”, desperately trying to calm myself down. I always hated crying, I hated being sensitive, I hated being weak, I hated that being weak only made everyone want to hurt me more. I had to get stronger, I had to be better, I must learn how not to cry. Each day when I’d have a meltdown and start crying I’d try different methods to keep myself from crying; once I was able to abate my tears by not breathing; it made me so happy to have some sense of control over my emotions. I needed to get stronger, I needed to stop crying, I needed to stop being so sensitive so that others wouldn’t feel so inclined to treat me the way they did. I had to be ‘normal’, I would study my tormentors, see how they interact amongst themselves and how they treated me; and I would try to unravel the mysteries of how ‘normal’ people act and think. 

In preschool and elementary school, no one would want to play with me or allow me to play in their group (the soul exception was kick ball, but that didn’t even last a year before they didn’t want me playing with them anymore either). I got transferred around to several different schools throughout the early years, probably no less than 3 schools before 5th grade, but everywhere I went it was the same. 

I’d usually spend recess alone reading in the shade, one school had a pine tree I loved to sit under and read, but when the teachers found out I was hanging out there they told me I couldn’t go there anymore because ‘they couldn’t see me’ over there, a valid excuse, but you know where I am and you should know I’m trying to avoid the other students and enjoy myself. If I try to read up nearer the school everyone will see me and start harassing me, asking what I’m reading, taking it from me, refusing to give it back, destroying it, etc. 

In first or second grade, we had a bathroom in the corner of our classroom. One day when I went to use it, I had to poop. Something about me: I’ve suffered from chronic constipation my whole life, so it took me a while. When I got out, the teacher dragged me to the front of the classroom and screamed at me (she tried to ask me the question a couple of times and I didn’t answer because I was embarrassed, so she’d raise her voice until she was eventually  screaming at me) “what were you doing in there!?” To which I could only answer honestly, through tears streaming down my face at the humiliation “I was pooping”, and the entire class burst out into laughter and I was allowed to go back to my seat where I tried to forget I existed for the rest of the day. This gave me problems for decades when it came to using public restrooms, something I’ve only recently gotten over. 

In elementary school; when I was in gym class one day, our teachers took us outside to play baseball. I knew enough about baseball to know you need to hit the ball and run to your bases without getting out; but what I was clueless on was the line forming etiquette. 

At this point my low standing on the social hierarchy had been well established already, so of course I get pushed to the back of the line after I was picked last. I’m fine with this, as long as everyone keeps their order I’ll slowly advance and get my turn to swing; the other team gets enough outs, we switch, same deal, switch back; but no one is maintaining the original line position, and again I get shoved to the back of the line. This repeats, over and over again until class is over. At this point I’m furious, I try to tell the teacher through tears how I’ve been keeping track and literally every other person got a turn to swing except for me. The teacher didn’t care, I’m dumbfounded; so I throw a fit saying I’m not leaving the field until I get my turn, the teacher laughs and says ‘ok have fun’ and leads the class back inside the building, leaving me alone on the field, crying. Not one person spoke up for me, no one wanted to help me feel better, no one cared; something you may have already picked up on, but it’s a bit of a theme in my life it seems. 

Ive had 2 babysitters smack me around. I can’t say why the one did it, but the one did it because I accidentally rode into his leg with my bike. Now from my perspective back then, I saw I was coming straight at him and I wanted to stop, but in a moment of panic, I completely forgot how to stop.

In middle school, I had a rare instance of a good day in which I didn’t get into any fights or trouble at school. I was riding the bus on my way back to my babysitters, and I honestly can’t remember what happened on the bus-if anything; but 3 kids followed me off the bus and waited until we were away from the main roads and started chucking rocks at me, several of them left bruises, but a few broke the skin. I was bleeding from the head by the time I got to my babysitters house. What did I do while they were pelting me with stones? Nothing, I just kept walking, I had such a ‘good’ day, and I didn’t want to ‘ruin’ it by getting in trouble at the last minute. To this day my mom still has the pictures she took of me with my face covered in my own blood. 

Many times over the years after incidents like this, I brought up the idea of suing the people that did things to me, or the teachers and schools for allowing it to happen (i know because the rocks happened outside of school there’s nothing they could have done) but I was always shot down, being told something along the lines of ‘everyone’s going around suing each other these days, we’re not like that.’ I can still remember coming home from pre-school and elementary school pretty much every day, running, crying to my room and screaming about how “I wish I were dead”; luckily as a child I had no idea how to commit suicide, otherwise I’d have likely had an attempt or two under my belt.

That same babysitter (from the stone story) my mother and I would end up finding dead one morning. My mom brought me over to drop me off and she wasn’t answering the door, so my mom managed to ‘break in’ and found her dead on her bed. By this point in my life (this would have probably been early to mid middle school) I was already so jaded from my life’s experiences and so numb I was more or less unbothered by her death. I remember my mom crying saying she wishes she could make me understand death, I understood she was gone and we’d never see her again, but I also figured we were never super close; she’d watch me for 30 minutes or less before the bus would grab me and I’d hang out there and watch TV in a separate room while waiting for mom to get off work. So she was never someone who was super important or special in my life. I was actually kind of jealous, her suffering was over (she was on morphine because of a metal plate she had in her head), she no longer had to deal with the suffering that comes with living; I couldn’t be sad about that. 

When I was in high school, I also attended a vo-tech center; on the bus ride to vo-tech one day, this kid I wasn’t paying any attention to or interacting with thought it would be ‘funny’ to choke me out from behind. He eventually let go, but I grabbed his arm and put it back around my neck, begging him to finish what he started; much to my disappointment, he didn’t oblige. 

I had almost all the guys in my gym class once think it would be ‘funny’ to dog-pile on me, I was about to pass out when the teacher decided enough was enough and made everyone get off as I desperately gasped ‘help! I can’t breathe!’. I’m sure if I hadn’t spoken up they would have let it continue until I passed out, or worse.

I kept telling myself ‘I just need to make it through 12 years, then I’m out of here and I’ll never have to see these people again’. Graduation day came and went, my last responsibility and obligation free summer quickly came and passed before my first day of college. Finally, an actual, real fresh start. Somewhere where no one knows me, I figure my ‘reputation’ was permanently sullied at my old school, but all my years of learning how to interact through painful trial and error were finally going to pay off. No longer would I be a ‘r****d’, I’d be ‘normal’, just like everyone else and never again would people be so cruel or hateful towards me for being different. My life was about to get exponentially better and I couldn’t be more excited. 

I struggled to make friends in college, and a few people still thought I was extremely weird or even outright hated me; but here I wasn’t bullied, assaulted, or harassed; I’m just not included in things, I’m isolated. I manage to make a few friends; each week two of the kids (brothers) who hate me would host a LAN party to play video games, I’m always interested, but I learned a long time ago from trying to include myself in things, if I’m not invited, it’s best to assume I’m not wanted; and naturally I was never invited. Any time I’d try to invite or include myself in a groups fun I’d get told to get lost, no one likes me, how I should kill myself, etc. Not until the last week or so of college, I get randomly invited to the last LAN party at lunch. Being told I’m welcome to come and ‘the more the merrier’. 

I attend the party, I think all is going well, I’m friends with some of these kids, not so much with others, but I think I may have found a group, a cliche, somewhere I belong. We all get hungry and go out to Steak and Shake; while we’re eating, i can’t remember what I said, i thought we were all having a good time, my best friends gf (at the time, ex now) says “You know what anon, you have got to be, THE, CREEPIEST, MOTHERF****R, I’ve ever met in my life! We had been around each other a couple of times before then so I thought we were all good. But when she made that declaration, no one; not even my best friend, stood up to defend me…my soul was crushed, I took her outburst and their silence to speak to a general consensus and agreement. Despite my 12 years of suffering and training to learn how to interact like a normal person; after all that, I still get told how much of a creep I am. Have all my years of suffering been pointless? Is this just what existence is meant to be for me? For my kind? I don’t know what I did in my last life to earn so much negative karma, I dont understand what I’ve done to deserve such a fate. 

Since college, I’ve had a few similar instances at different places I’ve worked. I’ve had more than a couple of instances at places I’ve worked where people felt they had to tell me what a creep I am. I’ve been told I ‘look like’ a school shooter, a pedo, a f****t, a r****d, etc; just for trying to make friends with the people I find myself surrounded by. No matter what I do, it seems impossible for me to win; this just seems to be my lot in life: struggling desperately to make connections to others so as not to be alone, only to be nearly universally rejected and told how I’m still weird and that no one likes me. 

The conditions surrounding my life, the way others have treated me, and my perception of my life, have all culminated in the person I am now. 

I’ve worked so hard, all my life, to try and be ‘normal’, so that I can fit in to the world around me. I’ve taken every strong feeling I ever had and systematically shoved it down into a deep, dark corner of my mind. Because ultimately I’ve learned that the majority of humans don’t care and will actively work to make things worse if they know something bothers you. 

Because; my entire life, my existence has seemed paradoxical. 

Like I was born into a world I was never meant for. If it wasn't for modern medicine and doctors, the condition I was born in, would have proven fatal at any other point in human history. 

Every time I tried to make friends growing up it was met with failure, rejection, and ridicule. It just seems like everyone, including god, has been against me from the beginning, like I was never meant to live for more than a few months.

I guess it just seems natural given the circumstances, that I am punished for living when I wasn't supposed to; like this is what you get when you go against the natural order of the universe. 

I don’t know if anyone else has faced similar circumstances, if anyone out there can relate, empathize with me, if anyone feels similarly; if anyone can prove me wrong, that humans aren’t evil by nature: willing to jump on anyone they feel they have an advantage over, anyone they view as someone less.

I've been a pussy my entire life,"I'm 18M and regret the majority of my life. Back at school, i was afraid of people. Afraid of getting hit when i fight back. I got beat a dozen of times and every single time i acted like they were a real friend and don't wanna fight, cuz I'm too scared. My dad is a pussy too. Recently i had a get-together and was standing near the guy who hit me, and fear started to raise in my head. I fucking hate myself. I don't want to be afraid, i don't want to act, but that's all i do. I talk and talk and talk, don't go shit because it affects me directly and my parents would get mad at me and I'm skinny, wear glasses. You can picture me as a perfect idiot.

Recently i got a girl online who liked me, i liked her a lot, we spent good time together. Today a guy flirted with her and she didn't refuse it. I feel too powerless than this guy and can't swear good because i start getting afraid. Thinking I'm just like my dad talking shit and don't do nothing real makes me hate me bad. I'm just fed up of my life, all i want is to die. I'm stuck just like that one vehicle when traffic lights go crazy. Everyone goes on smooth with their lives, I'm stuck in the same place and people who shouldn't be talking about me, say I'm too bad to be a monitor(I'm the monitor of my class). 

No girl has ever liked me except this girl. Today a guy chatted with me like a girl in my class who i decided the moment i saw her, will never be mine. I got my hopes high until the moment he broke it to me. He's the only person who i trust there and he did this. I've been feeling completely worthless from then. I've been considering suicide as i can't live with this shit, but I'm too dumb to make a good plan. I live with my family, go out at 6am and return at 8pm. Travel hours to reach college, far away. Any plans pls i need one. I don't want to survive after attempting that, and wanna just die some place peaceful listening music. I can bet this post will be ignored by everyone.

I increasingly hate everything (except plants &amp; animals),"I’m just sick of global society. I’m sick of the direction we’re heading. It really feels like neo/techno feudalism. IMHO, the purpose of society should be to eliminate/reduce human suffering and I just don’t see that happening. I don’t see that happening based on the amount of homelessness I see. I don’t see that happening in terms of climate issues and reducing GHG emissions &amp; other pollution. I don’t see young people being supported- high costs of living, debt, low wages.

For the US exclusively 
Where is free/cheap healthcare for all
Where is free PUBLIC higher education
Where is cheap/healthy/convenient food
Where is affordable childcare

And the counters I’ve heard to these things have been like: oh there’s progress being made, rent control, more scholarship opportunities, young people, well you should get involved.

I’ve been involved. It’s so bureaucratic and soul-crushing you lose vision of the bigger picture, the reason you got involved. “Well just keep at it.” Why TF would I keep at it when I know I’m operating in a system that is built against me, against my values? And then like, let’s say you get an important piece of legislation passed great! It has no teeth, it’s not enforceable, it has no funding attached to it, it’s easily circumvented. 

We have people sleeping on the sidewalk, scared out of their minds, while Jeff Bezos &amp; Elon Musk are rocketing themselves to space because, why not?! Yay rich people fun! We have billionaires getting richer in a pandemic! Why would I be involved when politicians I’ve admired and supported have been able to accomplish so little? Or do (what I consider to be) reprehensible actions I can only hope were done so out of political necessity.

I work a bullshit job that shouldn’t exist but I’m sure as fuck glad does because *survival.* But, it doesn’t align with my values. In this environment, I don’t know if it would even be possible to have any job that aligned with my values which is so frigging depressing! What do I want to do? I want to help people. Great! Government, healthcare, nonprofits… bureaucratic, underfunded, nightmares. 

I just don’t get it. I’m so sad. I’m so sad for the needless human suffering- physical &amp; mental. Like I don’t get how any sane, mildly informed person would not have depression/anxiety… which sucks!

I don't know if I'll ever feel normal,"just felt isolated for years and I noticed lately I'm in a negative self-hatred spiral. the only thing I feel a pull to do is go visit my hometown which my parents find totally irresponsible since I am unemployed and don't even have at least 20k saved up. which I understand but damn I'm just so depressed. 

being in my late 20s it feels like my whole life will just be playing catchup. other people my age are happy with lives, good looking, relationships, picked a good career, etc. even my mom recently when she got mad at me started saying shit like if you listened to me you would have a college degree by now etc. well i never knew what degree to get. i am smart but i never knew what to go for and never hardly asked for help from the outside world which doesn't seem normal at all. with depression and feeling emotionally weird asf it's even harder to think about career etc. all i want to do is retreat. all I do is feel numb and never 100% present or relaxed. since maybe age 23? had problems before then but at least felt normal in my body.

i have had 0 relationship with any friends/peers for like 8 years. even a job I managed to get for the holidays the person my age was inviting everyone to her house except me. it's so easy to feel like something is freaking wrong with me. my brother visited recently and even that was awkward asf, time with family is awkward because they all moved forward, are happy and better looking, have a partner, job, apartment or house

people in public always ask me if i am a student and i feel bad for not being one. and now people even ask me if i have kids which makes me feel sad because i don't and on top of that have never even had a boyfriend. i tried to start volunteering recently and everyone was way older than me and they were confused how I had time to volunteer and were asking if i work etc. so then I felt like an idiot. plus i didn't realize you have to lead tours so being an introvert I bailed

i don't know what i'm going to do with my life and if I'll feel like shit forever and no one will love me  then what's the point. on top of that going into 30s i'm even less desirable romantically. never even kissed anyone. isolated since forever but still expected to function normally in society and be happy. then there is all the covid bullshit now but i won't get into that",[deleted],1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm2oe5/i_dont_know_if_ill_ever_feel_normal/

I feel my life is meaningless and worthless now that I've given up on my dream,"I always had this dream of being someone adventurous. As a kid, I wanted to grow up and get a job that would involve me getting in a lot of adventures and would make people say"" yeah that guy is cool. Whenever I thought about it I always wanted to be a pilot( could have been for a  huge passenger plane or even for fighter jets), astronaut, professional explorer, a deep-sea diver, and well so on. But when I look back on it now I realised I hadn't really prepared much for it. You see people who have cool jobs like that and they began preparing for it ever since they were children. I mean when I was a kid, I was just pretty shy in nature and would just sit in and watch cartoons every day and whatnot. Only when I came to high school did I really realize what it would take to pull off such a feat. I came across an article where a girl of my age was interviewed for a newspaper and she said that she wanted to be an astronaut and had already done a whole lot of things for it such as get specialized training in scuba diving, was in the process of acquiring a private pilot license and had excellent grades in school and was going to college where I had wanted to go. After reading that I just felt really bad for myself. I just felt pity and anger wondering why it couldn't have been me. I mean it's never me. No matter how much I try I cannot do anything extraordinary. I thought that now since I'm in college anyhow I can start afresh and change my whole life direction but things just stayed the same. I don't have the best grades. Any skill I know is of subpar quality and whenever I try to learn or study I just feel things getting more and more difficult. I can barely remember formulas, definitions, or anything of that matter. Hell, there are some words that I just cannot spell correctly anymore. When I look at my friends who have amazing grades, published research papers, attended international conferences I can't help but feel shitty. I don't feel like being around them anymore because when we talk about future plans they often would bring up their successes and achievements which I couldn't and cannot match anytime soon. I always thought that living with my parents was lame and annoying. I hated listening to their nagging, scoldings and complaints, and would always say to myself that I couldn't wait to leave home and go be by myself in college but now that I m here I miss my parents and mom especially terribly and I keep wishing to at least go back to them because they are the only source of positivity and support i have left anymore. They always told me things will get better and that i shouldn't worry a lot. Thinking or hearing that from just sometimes brings me close to tears. My close friends have more or less gone their own ways after graduating HS and none of them ever really keep in touch with me anymore. I have to always message them first. My best friend with whom id have daily conversations isn't around anymore and id is lucky if I get a response from him in less than a week. I don't have any relationship or a partner. Being on campus and seeing couples sit together, hold hands, and whatnot i just feel sad and angry at the same time. I was and am always that kid in the corner of the room.

30 years old and still a complete failure in life with a bleak future.,"I’m the most pathetic person I’ve ever known in my life. Look at me: I’ll be 31 this July (2022), and I’ll have accomplished absolutely nothing in my life. I’m pretty much in the same situation that I’ve been in for the previous 10 years: Living out a dismal existence in a low-income apartment, with only a disability check, never had my own car (could never afford one and this is the land of the car, sigh…), living from monthly check to monthly check.

I’ve been diagnosed with things like: high-functioning autism, depression, and ADHD. I was in special ed in grade school - never had any friends. I dropped out of school in sixth grade, just to be trapped in that old decaying house which was several miles away from town. Both my parents were of ‘advanced age’ when they had me. My mother would sit there and accuse my sick dad and his family of all sorts of crazy things – like poisoning her smokes or ‘plotting or planning’. When I was younger, I had a big half-sister who basically raised me, but she left when she was a teenager and… I don’t want to talk about that. In fact, there’s a lot of things that I would much rather take to the grave than ever talk about with anyone, because it’s too painful, embarrassing, makes me look like an utter piece of shit.

I’ve been taking antidepressants and talking with a counselor for years. I’m ashamed of the sheer lack of progress. It’s a cycle: Oh, I’m doing something new, that’s cool. You’re going out for walks, you’re writing stuff, you’re composing music, or we just talk about current events. That’s if he doesn’t spend about a third of his appointment time on the phone. I’ve made a fool out of myself on the Internet in the past because all I know how to do is be a toxic piece of shit who shits on everyone and everything. I can’t connect with people, even online. I’m too boring, too toxic, too miserable, and I fucking hate it.

I’m utterly ashamed of who I am as a person. Who the ‘real me’ is. The ‘real me’ is a horribly bitter narcissist who doesn’t want to work for anything ever. Who doesn’t want to do anything for anyone. In fact, I’m not willing to do anything for myself. I’ve wasted literal years on YouTube, video games, reading Wikipedia and Reddit, trolling on forums. When it comes to any internet community, I’m forever doomed to be one of these three things: A lurker, boring, or banned. Then the era of social media, with its ‘real’ names and ‘influencers’, just kinda killed it. I hate it.

Several years ago I used to have several friends on IM, but again, I was ashamed of the way I acted. I talked too much about boring shit, I was toxic and miserable, everything I said just kinda spewed out of my fingers with little thought or care. I hate the fact that every time I write something, it just ends up being an incoherent mess like this. I can’t sort my thoughts neatly or anything like that: if it doesn’t come out the way it is, it probably will never come out at all.

I’m the most unproductive person I know. And I feel powerless to improve that because of my low energy and ever-fluctuating mood, plus my inability to concentrate. I used to take Adderall but apparently, if you’re not doing anything with your life, then fuck you. You’re gonna take Welbutrin, and you’re gonna love it. Sure, Adderall had its negative side effects: Severe constipation (fun to deal with), painfully dry ear canals, dry nose… At least I didn’t have to put up with allergies anymore.

A few years ago, my nurse practitioner retired and a new one came in - That’s when I lost my Adderall script for good. Then what little productivity I had just gradually crashed down into nothingness. It’s one of those things: Why didn’t you do anything about that? Why didn’t you talk to this and that person and try to do this and that… Ugh! Every goddamned thing is “why don’t you do this and do that”. Look, I wouldn’t be in this fucking mess if I didn’t have so many issues with communicating to people on the phone, IRL, or even on the Internet.

I got sick of reaching out for help on the Internet years ago, because that usually results in more misery later on. At least, that’s what I think. Being afraid of trying to reach out, trying to make new friends, or even just saying how I feel, because I always fail. I always say too much, too little, or the wrong thing. Or never want to make a commitment. Or just brush off whatever advice they give me. I feel so alienated from the rest of the world that I fear the day that I’ll lose the few Internet friends I have now.

I’m pretty much good at nothing. No skills. Unemployable. And it’s my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all on me. Stop blaming your parents for your failures, they’re both dead. What about their extended families who did nothing? Who knew that I was in a shit situation as a child. I wish I could start all over again. Wipe the slate clean. But then I’d probably find someway to half-ass it, to fail, to make myself look like a pathetic idiot. Not even a life worth living. Nothing to contribute to society, at all.

I can see why it’s so hard for people to seek help. I know I need help. But that takes a kind of commitment. Some faith in both them and yourself. You gotta work to change yourself, you can’t just sit here and go on and on about how you’re such a failure in life. Reach out, get out of your comfort zone, make some friends. It’s like I somehow don’t know. I do know. It just doesn’t make a difference, because my entire life is dictated by my feelings and my desires. The way I feel at the moment is the only thing that matters.

My sleep patterns are always shifting forwards. It seems like I go to bed later and later, and wake up later and later, and I don’t like taking sleeping pills. There are weeks when I sleep all day, and weeks where it’s in-between. Sleep half the day and half the night. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea last year, had to wait half a fucking year to even get the CPAP machine, then I fucked around and waited until it was too late to swap masks and have to wait until June to get another one. You see how utterly useless I am at solving my own issues in life? Because I’m too fucking afraid of placing a phone call, to argue with someone, etc.

Of course, I’m not employed, I’m not having a bad day at work, I’ve got it easy! Never mind the fact that my lazy existence is the most I can do. The prospect of even trying to attain employment at this point is probably scarier than just jumping off of that cliff. I could go to college, but I fear that I’ll lose motivation and just flunk classes again, and get stuck with student debt. My whole life is fear of failure, validated by nothing but past failure. And my future is nothing but failure. I know it’s only going to get downhill from here. What’s the point?

I’m a child in an adult’s body who refuses to accept adult responsibilities, because I’m too weak to ignore the mental anguish which comes with years of social isolation. I’m too weak to face my fears head on. Because if I do try, I’m probably going to get completely destroyed. Or just give up after only a little while because it’s too painful. I’m scared. It all just seems so impossible and overwhelming. And I need to do It alone with little resources.

I fear that I’ll be stuck homeless sometime in the near future, having to leave everything I’ve ever owned behind, no one to turn to. Nowhere to go, but down. All it takes is for me to fail a yearly inspection, to fail the once-every-two-years disability review, or for my health to fail, and it’s all over. All over. And it’s going to be pain and misery, separated from the few things in life I hold dear. I’ll go completely insane and unable to help myself in any meaningful way. I’ll be truly better off dead.

I’m very sorry if reading this has been frustrating or depressing, because believe me – it IS fucking frustrating and depressing. If you can even make any sense of what I’m trying to say. I don’t think I even know what I’m trying to say, other than I’m the most pathetic, hopeless person I know. And please don’t suggest weed, that shit won’t help me. Nothing will help me at this point. I don’t want to ever talk about my problems, it’s too painful. Embarrassing. I have to be vague or it’ll hurt far too much for me to bear. At least that’s what I feel.

I know that I’ve been a lot more fortunate than a lot of other people. People who suffered from similar things I have. Neglectful family, depression, autism and yet I’m the most pathetic one out there. I just sit here and waste time. Waste time. Never creating anything. Never getting into anything new or deeper into what I’m really interested in. It’s not like I don’t have interests and hobbies, but even I fail massively at those. I’ve tried to learn Spanish or Japanese, but I failed because I don’t try. I’ve tried to learn programming, drawing, writing, or even just being good at any game that I play. And the sheer repetition and lack of progress just makes me less and less interested over time. I just don’t fucking try, ever. I just sit here like a sack of shit and somehow magically expect to just ‘get good’ at it.

My interests are narrow to the point of unhealthy obsession. It could be a single show, a book, a video game, a song, a small community, if it gives me pleasure, I’ll cling onto it for dear life until I burn myself the fuck out. And when that happens, it’ll be far too long until I find another thing which satisfies me. It could be days, weeks, months before something somehow catches my eye. Or I revisit something, just to milk any new pleasure from it dry and be empty again. I hate that. I wish I could just float from one game to another, one show to another, etc. just so that I have something to talk with people about! But I don’t. I just don’t.

Please don’t say I’m just being modest or too hard on myself. It’s the truth. It just is. I’ve either lost all self-control, or just never learned it in the first place. I just cried. I rarely ever cry, probably because I don’t have the guts to do it, or I’m just too dead inside. But I do hurt. I do care. I want the mental anguish to stop. I want the running thoughts to stop. I want this fucking fear anxiety and depression to stop. I want to be able to be alive again. It’s been far too long.

I want to be able to stop running away from my problems one day. That would be nice. One day, things will get better. I’ll be able to stand up and face my fears, my problems, and conquer them. Become better. Go back to school. Get some connections and resources. Get some friends. And of course, get some sort of source of income. Wonderful. It’ll happen, I just need some time to recover, some time to relax, to think, to do.

But that won’t happen. It’s all lies. Pathetic lies I tell myself so that I can even get out of bed sometimes. The lies I need to live. That’s all it is. Without those lies, without being interested in something, without having some sort of pleasure, I’m absolutely nothing. I’m an empty husk of a man and my only hope for this pain to go away at this point is to pay the biggest price possible: My life. My worthless, pathetic, childish, empty life of nothing.

There’s no words that’ll help me. There’s no drugs that’ll make me feel better. There’s nothing I can watch or read that can make me feel better. There’s nothing inside of me which can bring me to change. I feel that I just sat here and allowed myself to be too far gone, and that’s perhaps the most terrible shame I have. Because I was too scared to do anything.

Please, don’t fear for me. I’ll try to get through this one way or another. I want to live and experience things. Maybe that’s also just a lie. It’s getting to the point where all I know is short bouts of joy and laughter, before long bouts of nothingness, sadness, grief, fear, and hatred. I’m stuck on this never-ending cycle and I have no way out. I don’t want to cry for help. I don’t want to do anything. I just want to be. But I fear that one day, just ‘be-ing’ will be too much to bear, and I have no idea what I’ll do other than to just lie there and suffer in isolation.

If you’ve somehow read this far, thank you. I’m almost done now. I suppose I’ll just get back to the daily grind of being too afraid and tired to do anything meaningful with my days. And being utterly ashamed of how much of a pathetic lazy piece of shit I am. The time just flies by. It feels like the pandemic only started yesterday. It feels like I’ve only moved in here last month. And that I’ve only turned 18 just a few years ago. I’ll be in the same place nine years from now and probably be suffering from diabetes or some other health ailment. Just another thing to drain my limited energy reserves even more every goddamn day until I inevitably fuck up and something terrible happens.

Thanks again for reading this.

Just getting this off my Chest,"I have been suffering from what I can only imagine is some kind of fairly severe depression for almost 2 years now. I’m sorry if this post is hard to read I’m new to redit and have been reading post in this sub and it just made me feel moved to share my story.

To start off my depression started almost 2 years ago. I was in a wonderful relationship with this beautiful girl I had met in highschool and I had moved away to college but I still came home every weekend to see her. Everything was going great and then over the course of a few weeks (or months, I don’t even remember how it really started) I just began to get more and more depressed. At first I didn’t think anything of it, I’m the middle child of 2 other boys, we grew up with a very abusive father until I was 12 when my mom took us and left and I just always through depression was something only weak people got and i never fully understood it. Although now I know that my real father struggled while mental illness and sever depression. Anyway back to my story, every in my life was going great, I had made new friends in college and my relationship was going great I just could feel myself becoming more and more closed off and lonely even though I was surrounded by amazing friends and family. I began to fight with my girlfriend because she could tell I was being distant we started to fight more and more the the distance only made it worse. When I finally did open up to her all she knew to do was tell her mother with made me miserable, I hated that fact that I thought someone saw me as weak and I started to dread seeing her and her family. A couple months into my depression and my girlfriend has become the only person who truly knows how I feel and is the only person I ever confide in. 

Then one day a close friend of my girlfriends commented suicide. This absolutely destroyed her, she became extremely depressed and started to have suicidal thought. I then pushed all my problems aside and did my best to help her through her issues. I took her to counseling and did everything I could to help her. But she slowly got better and was never the same. And now with us both being depressed our relationship became miserable, neither one of us were happy and we thought that if we split up maybe we would be able to find some joy in our lives again, so we broke up in made and these last 10 months have been the worst of my life. She was my best friend and the only person in the world I have ever loved. It’s gotten easier these past few months but I have lost all joy in my life. Everything I used to love i have no passion for anymore. I’m still in college but I don’t every compete any off my work, I never go to class. I hardly ever sleep, ill go 5 or 6 night sleeping maybe 2 hours a night then ill just sleep 18 hours straight. I find no meaning in life anymore, I just feel this giant empty hole in my chest that I can’t feel. My grandmother died last month, we were extremely close and I never even shed a tear, the rest of my family was balling and I was just sitting there with no emotion. I’m never happy, I’m not even sad, I just feel absolutely nothing. Almost every other night i put my pistol to my head just hoping it’ll go off because I’m not man enough to actually pull the trigger. I’ve tried to move on and tried to get better I just don’t know what to do, and I have no one to tell. I transferred colleges so I lost all the friends I had and I’m too embarrassed to tell me family. I’ve read every self help book I can find and nothing does it for me. I just keep praying that one day soon God will take me off this earth because I don’t know how to keep living like this.

"Moved to a new city, great job, closer to friends...never felt so sad and down","I'm just summarizing my current/past situation, because I'm really exhausted:
- Moved to a new city some days ago (shared flat with 5 people) for an internship, staying for finishing my degree
- Lived in a shared flat before (roommate was barely there -&gt; kinda got comfy with being alone, focusing on myself)
- I'm closer to some friends and my gf now (lives in the same city)

Besides all of these good things...I feel so smashed, my sleep got really bad (quite sensitive to noise and the flat is louder than the old one, at least this is my first impression), can't really eat anymore, lost already 4-6 pounds of weight

Some thoughts I have:
- Weather is getting better, other people expect now from me to show up at parties/get together etc -&gt; kinda frightens me, but also makes me happy to have the possibility
- How long should I try getting comfy in the new flat/city?

I hope this is just somethling like a short depressive episode due to the move (I already had a big one in the past and now I'm super afraid, that this is just the beginning).

Did someone else experienced something similar in the near past? How long did it take for you to overcome such an episode after moving to another city?",blender_421337,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmhmqh/moved_to_a_new_city_great_job_closer_to/
How do I help my Mother In Law?,"My wife recently revealed to me that her mother has extreme depression and has had it for most of her life; never once been diagnosed and they could never afford to go to the doctor or get medication for it. On top of that they're immigrants and mental health was either non-existent or extreme taboo; her grandparents were also abusive and dealing with their own mental issues.  


Her mom stays up super late, wakes up at like 4 PM everyday and sits in bed doing nothing but watching videos on her phone.  


She never cooks, cleans, wants to do anything. She never has the energy either. Is not capable of even taking care of herself sometimes.  


She struggles with almost any and all tasks, simple tasks like dishes or taking a shower can take hours to complete. Rarely leaves the house, has no job.  


If she has an appointment or something time sensitive...9/10 she will be late or just wont show up.  


Growing up my wife said that they all made their own food cause their mom just never cooked. They never had people or friends over cause the house was never clean. Laundry was only completed when it became overwhelming. Cleaning was a whole day ordeal because her mom just kept putting it off until they couldn't help it anymore. Marriage has been in shambles for decades but somehow still together.   


Now they finally have health insurance and can probably be see a doctor.  


I guess I'm just trying to understand what I can do to help my wife and my mother in law? Is seeing a doctor the first step? Therapy? She does recognize that she has issues, and sobs because she feels like she can not do anything.  


Her case is really extreme from my untrained perspective. I'm not sure where we should start.",Loud-Employer5435,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmgg5e/how_do_i_help_my_mother_in_law/
Depression because real world and facing reality,"Everyone’s depression stems from the world. How can you create your own world to make that depression go away? No crazy event in my life makes me depressed but the world as a whole does. Being like me you see everything. I see all the behind the scenes shit that goes on and it’s unfortunate. I see everyone for who they truly are. My brain is wired to out think everyone because I’m a male and use logic. I use my logic so much that you come to a point where you see life is actually dogshit. Things are such a waste, life is rigged, and people are actors. It’s like everything is ruined for me and I can never be happy because my brain sees the reality of things. Most people live in delusion or a fairy tale. Like life means something. I see no meaning, feel like shit, then keep having a snowball affect from being depressed then as the future keeps coming I get more behind in This game called life. It’s like everyone is on their feet running to something meaningless while I sit back and watch the rats. So much engines in the world. I have a human instinct in me that I wish I never had. I distant myself from these humans because I hate them all but then the human side kicks in and I’m lonely because everyone has feelings. I want to create my own reality to make it a fun one living but it’s impossible to create my own reality when I have such logical thinking and have to face reality everyday. It’s so tough because I think a girlfriend would really help me finding meaning and feeling love but I’ve never been outgoing in my life because I’m just so sad about this reality, I have tons of drive and motivation I just need help but can’t get nothing because people tend to only help and treat you well when you’re in a good spot in life but people who need just some little help don’t get it because they appear to be sad and depressed like myself and people shy away from that no real people in this world to help me. People find me scary cause I’m 6’6 and have the look of I hate life so no one wants to come around me. Just me please. All I need is to feel some fucking love that’s it. I never had a girlfriend in my life me rn though I’m good looking tall and fit. I think girls are scared because I see through all the bullshit.

Looking better made me more depressed,I started hitting the gym after I broke up with my ex that cheated on me 7 months ago. I was always a skinny guy but I have gained like 20 KG and have a lot more muscle now. Several girls have asked me out the last couple of months but I’m way too depressed to start a relationship. It actually feels worse to get noticed because I’m not interested in getting any attention from girls.

Feeling tired and what not,"Been having depression over many years, of course I have good times but rarely, but I just feel like a failure sometimes cause I have goals for the future I wanna achieve, but I’ve been skipping school a lot since I feel like I’ve lost motivation for anything most of the time. While doing so along with having a horrible relationship with my mother, we usually end up fighting even though I don’t want to, I end up feeling like I’m a horrible person. I’m in my junior year in high school and my grades are fucked up as hell, and I’m tired of the usual talk that my councilor gives me that “you need to stay in school if you’re ever here, that’s why we’re here to help you” I’ve always told myself to just push through anything in my way, but whenever they say that, it angers me cause they repeat it over and over again, I just need a fucking break sometimes. They act like they know what I’m going through, don’t get me wrong I feel like everyone has been through depression or something close to it, but holy fuck they act as if they personally know me.. usually I’d say fuck it yeah let me vent to the councilor or explain what’s happening but it’s so one sided, I want to get out of this, I want to become better for myself but I’m so fucking angry not only at this but with the many things that have happened in my life, I feel tired, drained and wasted sometimes. I want to go to school to see my friends but at the same time I just stay in bed, and feel like shit about it cause I DO wanna go to school but it’s just idk man.

temporary happiness,"my brain is foggy and all i think about is ending my life and death. i told myself that at 14 if im still depressed by 18 i would end my life. 

sometimes i wish my mom took my first suicide attempt at 14 seriously and maybe it wouldn’t have gotten to this

i’m 19 now and i often think about the things i wouldn’t have done if i died when i was 18. But i also often think about the pain i would’ve stopped myself from feeling if i ended my life last year. 

i’m ready to move out and live alone but i feel like once the time comes when i live alone no one will be able to stop me. the only reason im living today is because i don’t know where to end it and i don’t want my mother to find me. 

I feel less happy and more cynical every year. It’s gotten to the point where my friends have noticed that i’ve been off lately, and that i barely go out

at this point i’m just too deep in and can’t talk to anyone about. i’m dying inside and the only way i know how to convey my emotions to people is by just saying “i’m just goin through it”

i can’t even eat like a regular person anymore. i’m not hungry even when my body is. once i eat enough to where the hunger pains are gone i’ll lose my appetite completely. I have to force myself to eat before i hang out with friends so i can function normally.

i feel like at this point i’m just waiting for my life to rot away. my mental health is declining and my physical health.

i don’t want to feel depressed for another 2 months just to feel normal for a week.

all i feel is depression, anxiety, and temporary happiness",Sliszer,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tmfk02/temporary_happiness/
Life is getting exponentially harder for me.,"I'm 28 going 29 this year. Life has always been a Rollercoaster for me. Consistently an A student till HS. Then dropped out of college due to severe disinterest and had to take care of mother that had Stage 3 cancer. Not formally diagnosed but I'm sure that's when I developed some sort of depression. After all that, I went to work on and off in small bakeries without formal training of any kind (which is a pressure of its own). Cooking and baking has always been my catharsis though, which is why I never gave up pursuing this career, even now. Picked it up really well but have gaps of missing knowledge since I never went to culinary school. Was doing well for a few years there but then the pandemic hit, and at the same time my mother went into remission, so I had to leave the west coast back to the east to take care of her. I love my family, don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to take of them. But we are not financially stable in any sense, even before the pandemic. So I guess this is where it leads to, the present, my current rock bottom (always thought the low points of my life can't get any worse, but here I am experiencing it all over again). Mom is now stable, or as stable as can be, so I'm back in the west coast and currently have a job working in a hotel in pastry.

I'm pretty good at what I do, or at least the things I know how to do, in terms of pastry. But working at a hotel is a whole different scene and they expect a lot out of you.

I'm pretty sure I'm about to be fired, because I may be a liability. I have huge gaps in my work history due to family issues. And huge gaps in my pastry knowledge because I am only well versed only in what I would consider 70% of the basics.

Employers really don't care about all of this. They just want qualified people. Not your sob story.

So yeah, life has always been hard for me personally and I feel it's about to get worse. If and when I do get fired, it'll hit me pretty hard mentally.

I hate all the lies,"All advice given to depressed people is just start up half-assed bull shit. If you give a reason for being depressed, people just tell you it's your fault for having unrealistic expectations. They tell you to act like and become a different person in order to feel normal, as if most depressed people dont already excel at faking happiness. They tell you to just learn to love yourself without a method or reason to do so. They'll tell us to just emulate others who are successful without thinking about how different people in different situations can still play out very differently. Then they tell us that we just want to be happy if we reject their bullshit answers to a problem they never even thought hard about.

I don’t want to exist.,"I don’t know how to describe this feeling. For a long time I often find myself feeling heavy in my chest and tired. I’m smart and go to a decent school right now but I feel like people tend to overestimate me. I want to do things but find myself fizzling out. Sometimes I think everyone knows me but no one really…KNOWS me. I feel disconnected. Some people seem to be living in a world, forever trying to find meaning in life, but not quite getting anything. I don’t want to say I’m depressed (had no clue where to type this) but I just feel so weird. I’m just drifting. I don’t want to die necessarily but sometimes I wish to just not exist. Just to be invisible from the world, having never been around, floating endlessly around without trying to think. I will say one thing though, and that is music is a true blessing. It does give me some hope. I try to think of happiness as moments in time, rather than something I’m working toward. That seems to help. I guess I’m just in a mood right now where I’m hopeless but I’ll come back tomorrow or a week later feeling great and cringing at this. I guess if there’s anything you can take away from this, it’s that things might feel shitty, but just keep going. There’s always something small to enjoy, whether it’s eating, taking a nice shower, crying to music silently, or just being with somebody else.

I’ve dealt with a lot of grief, a lot of handling shit on my own, and trying to keep up appearances.

I developed post traumatic stress disorder from it all and coping since, has been excruciatingly difficult. I threw myself into work for about a month and a half… i quickly burned out. The triggers became an everyday occurrence. I wanted help, I needed help, but I was afraid every hand extended towards me would only reach to choke me.

executive dysfunction. the loop that never ended for me.,"so, i’ve struggled w executive dysfunction for 9 years. throughout my 5 years of college, there was not one assignment that i did not do the night before it was due. i studied late, ate terribly, &amp; went thru a terrible depression.

a year after graduating i still have a really hard time doing things in general. i stall before i do anything at all &amp; it oftentimes leads to me not doing the thing at all. also, i kind of live my entire life on pause, only taking care of myself when i have something planned or to look forward to.

i left my job that i was insanely good at bc the commitment &amp; longevity terrified me…

I sit here for hours every morning trying to find a reason to function but I can never find one. I've done everything I could to change things. I workout, I do cardio, I keep my house clean, I eat well. I can't really socialize anymore. That feels like a mountain I cannot climb. I try but it's so debilitating that I've given up, I'm only capable of so much.

If I don't have to go to work I usually try to just lay in bed as long as I can to get the day to go by. Usually around 5 I feel a bit better and then try to cram a days worth of stuff into the day before I have to go to sleep. This is almost daily for me.

"Hi guys, this is my first time on this subreddit. I literally have no where else to go and never thought Reddit would be where I turned to","My life has been such a mess. I wish I was a better person growing up and made better decisions but I guess its normal when you are a kid or teenager to make these mistakes. Even now, as an adult, I still have so much to learn. I wished I treated my girlfriend better because she was so good to me. I miss holding her. I miss someone holding me. I couldn’t finish university because of my financial struggles and lack of motivation. I tried many things to make money to support myself and my family. There are moments I feel like I’m on top of the world and moments like these where I am at my lowest point and up past 5 AM thinking about how my life could’ve gone. My doctor told me I have depression or at least developing it and I’m only in my early 20s. I have had many thoughts of letting go but I always think about my family and how selfish it would be. I was told by a family member that getting help or talking to someone is a step towards victory. You win the little battles everyday and do what makes you happy. I have such a hard time talking about my feelings because I feel as if I am only bothersome. I have very little friends and family. I understand everyone has their own lives and problems and I always wanna help someone in need but sometimes I just want someone to do the same for me. The only problem is that I have people that will do the same but its just so hard for me to express my feelings or thoughts. Not because I am shy or lack communication skills.

I feel like an absolute wreck,"I (25F) have a lot of personal challenges including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and idiopathic hypersomnia (always tired, no solutions). I have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for almost 4 years now and even though he has no personal experience with mental illness, he does his best to be understanding and helpful when I’m falling apart. 

However, lately I’ve been feeling very insecure in our relationship because I feel like I don’t do even half as much for him as he does for me. He does a majority of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry, especially lately since my mental health has been declining in the last few months. I know that it seems simple for me to contribute more to these things, but it’s hard for me to bring myself to do these things when all I want to do is sleep and distract myself from my depression. I have talked to him about how I’ve been feeling and apologized for not doing more, and while he says he understands, I’m so scared that he’ll leave me because I’m a wreck. 

I’m trying to budget for therapy, but it’s looking like I probably can’t afford it until May. I just don’t know what I can do to feel better and start pulling my weight.",flimsyflow3r,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlzg73/i_feel_like_an_absolute_wreck/

10 years of depression and it never got better.,"I think i hit a dead end in my life.

i've been first diagnosed with depression and antisocial disorder back in 2013 which resulted from kids bullying me at school because i had no parents and came from a lower class family. I tried to kill myself 3 times but always somehow survived, sometimes i make jokes about it saying that might be immortal lol 

I'm currently in my last year of high school but i probably won't be able to graduate because my grades are beyond bad and i don't have time to fix them.
It was mostly because i spent half of the year sick after getting diagnosed with some potentially cancerous tumors in my lungs( my mother died from cancer so its no wonder) and the other half working so i can live somewhat decently. 

I mean it's not like i want to die, but i kinda dont wanna live either.
I still have big plans for the future, i would like to become a pilot one day because of my lifelong love for planes and all things flying, but its all hella expensive and i don't think that i will ever achieve it.

I feel like the only thing that brings me at least a bit of joy is cars, fast driving and flying. But again: money.

I've seen a few different therapists and gone through more kinds of antidepressants than i can remember but nothing has really helped so far.

I mean im 21 so i stil technically have my whole life in front of me bit i just feel so tired of living like this.
 I don't have any motivation to do things besides money and thrills. 
I just feel like i have no purpose in this world. 
I tried volunteering but i just didn't feel comfortable working for free without anything in return.
 Ik its selfish but that's just how i am. I didn't get any free help from anyone in my life ever, i always had to pay for everything.

Is it required to wait the time stated in the definition of depression?,"I think my symptoms seem to have escalated quite rapidly. I'm getting invasive thoughts of suicide again(like, today I read an email from my supervisor to finally come to work, and this just caused a daydream about how easy it would be to commit suicide at work), which I haven't really had for years now. I also had a sort of episode where I started pulling my hair, hitting, pinching and scratching myself. But it hasn't been this bad for long enough (like you always read ""symptoms persist for at least 2 weeks""), so I'm guessing I should wait a bit longer?

Technically, you could say I've had some mild symptoms for a longer time (like, I have been skipping work a lot, have barely gone in this year, without doing the remote work I was supposed to do. But this is just me being lazy and absolutely hating the task appointed to me, so barely qualifies). The appetite stuff I guess has been going on for over a week, I'm pretty sure, but honestly I don't have a very good grasp of time.

I'm also putting this off, since I didn't like the psychiatrist I went to last time too much (I was diagnosed with depression around this time last year too, and stopped the medication around half a year ago, since I was feeling better). She did the job, but ideally I would prefer someone less harsh. I'm also wondering if I should go to my general care doctor first this time?

Advice for homeschooling + some venting.,"I feel like I ruined my life by not taking my education seriously during high school. I’m 23, unemployed, and have zero goals in life. I’m not diagnosed with anything but I suspect that I have social anxiety, depression, and maybe ADD. I have a really low self-esteem regarding my intelligence, but I am putting the effort into improving. I’m watching videos and taking notes on YouTube about topics that I know I missed during high school. In a way I do feel proud of myself, but I find myself constantly pausing the video to look up a word that is unknown to me. Words that I feel like I should already know as an adult, and I feel stupid and begin self-loathing because of it. I don’t do this with just words though, I also do this with just about any topic that I’m not knowledgeable in. There’s just so much that I’m embarrassingly unaware of. All ranging between the sciences, to world history, to economics, to politics, to mathematics, to literature, even to basic English grammar. There’s just so much that I missed and I’m feeling too overwhelmed by it all. I don’t know where to start. To make matters worse, I feel like I’m being timed to learn all of these things. As I said earlier, I’m unemployed and I’m living off of my savings. I suppose I could get a job, but I lack any real-world skills. I have nothing worthy to offer to any potential employer, hiring me would just be an act of charity. Then there’s also the fact that I’m too shy to even talk to people. I’m afraid to open my mouth because I might reveal how stupid I truly am. I have no one to talk to about this stuff because I know I’ll just hear responses like “welp, you shoulda payed more attention in school.” Yeah, I know that already. What do I do now? Live a long miserable life until I finally succumb to old age? Well in that case, I might as well just end it now.

Melancholic depression,"I think I have melancholic depression or maybe just depression in general and I hate myself for it.

I know that rationally depression can happen to anyone no matter the circumstances but irrationally..I feel like it is my fault. That I should somehow overcome this and do better or be better. 

My brain is foggy. My body movements are slow. My speech is either too slow or a jumble of incoherent words. And I feel ashamed. Guilty even. That this is my fault. 

I can't talk about this to my parents who on several occasions said that depression is in the mind and that I should think positively blah blah blah. 

Right now I am learning to drive a manual car. It is like my 5 or 6th lesson. I sometimes skip practice because the guilt of not driving properly and wasting my dad's time (he is teaching me). Just now, my mom asked to my dad about my progress and he said that I am 60% there. Although ok enough to manage to drive in a straight line..I still haven't been very good at changing gears or making turns. He said it as a matter of fact. I know that I should not take it personally but my mind is a mess soo...

He kept adding about how my elder sister had/has better sharp reflexes and keen awareness and good judgment. My mom agreed stating that some just are naturally like that. Another jab at my shortcomings...and I hated how accurate it was. 

Although he was positive that I will be able to properly drive one day.. (after a lot and lot of practice) , I felt like sick. Sick and annoyed and frustrated and angry that my idiot self couldn't even learn something so easy...so simple. I felt inferior and vulnerable. 

I knew I wasn't clever or sharp. But i never said that too myself out of fear that it will come true (even though it was already the truth). Now everyone was intensely aware how slow and dumb I was. 

Naturally gifted....I hated that the fact that I didn't have my sister's strengths. I hated myself even more that I wasn't naturally good at anything. Only average. I hated that I was a slow learner. I hated that I had to work twice as hard at everything while it was easy for the rest. 

I am tired. My mind exhausted...depress is a disease that has been slowly rotting my brain and I can't do anything about it...just live with it.",bob-54,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm9am5/melancholic_depression/

I lived in a Latin household so of course whenever I talked about it with someone I was mostly met with ""man up"" ""its just a phase"" ""its all in your head"" or ""you are a kid you dont know"". Im now 21. 

I started therapy 3 years ago, started taking pills again this month. I don't get any joy out of life, I have had friends, best friends, girlfriends. Ive been to private islands, visited many countries and met a lot of people. Im a very lucky person, it just saddens me the amount of people that would have enjoyed those experiences even more than me but didnt get to do it.

Regret (rant),"I regret backing out of committing suicide pretty often. I’ve done it three times now, overdosed once. 

From the outside I know for a fact I look like a whiny teen. I’ve been told so many, many times.
I’m just tired of relapses. I’m tired of constantly putting everything I have into being better only to barely get anywhere, and then being exhausted. I’m tired of being yelled at for things I can’t control, and being told the same pathetic motivational quotes like they ever mean anything. 
I’m tired of people “praying” for me, saying I need to ask god for help. God wasn’t there for me when I was being sexually assaulted. God wasn’t there for me when my mom got blackout drunk and beat my sister in front of me. God wasn’t there when I was left alone for weeks because my dad would “rather be anywhere else”. I don’t care what people say, god isn’t real. There is no divine protection, and there is no savior. There’s life and death. What happens in between is your problem.

I’m tired of being labeled a mental case. 
I’m tired of seeing hallucinations, having flashbacks, and I’m tired of feeling manic. I’m tired of relying on prescription drugs to be good enough for society.

I wish I had done in then, because I have things to live for now. I have responsibilities and things that mean something to me. 
It’s like a dog having a bone dangled just far enough to where they can’t get it. 
I’ve come to terms that I’ll never be what my parents wanted me to be, and that my sister took on that role for me at a young age. A nurse at 27, dating to marry with a nice house in a nice neighborhood.
I’m struggling to even have the will to get up and enroll myself in community college. It’s pathetic. I work, but I work at a sports bar and because of my “disabilities” my hours keep getting cut. Turns out nobody wants to hire someone who can’t be around many people or loud noises, that goes into a manic episode if triggered. 

The more I think about what I am, the more depressed I get. Without the medication, I’d most likely be labeled “insane” and put in a glorified prison again. I take a lot of drugs and still see and hear the shit that I do, and I don’t remember half of my life when I was off of them. 
I keep getting told that it’s my fault by my mom, and she is basically begging me to “do something” but nothing I ever do is good enough, so why keep trying. 

I don’t know. It’s not logical to commit suicide at this point, but I can’t deny that I secretly hope a semi turns my car into a crushed can on my way to work. 

PTSD, severe depression, crippling anxiety, and psychotic disorder are not a good mix. Especially when you’re lucid. 

I don’t know if I have a future. I’ve proven safe for society with reasonable accommodations, but at what point does it even matter anymore? The fact that I need a crutch immediately sets me apart, and people notice.",HeatOk9224,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlznsa/regret_rant/

She would compare me a lot to my other teammates and eventually it made me lose my passion for it. I tried drowning myself a lot of times and one of my teammates would eventually pull me up.

I left swimming and suffered half of my junior high life being blamed financially by my mother. Up to this day I'm still afraid of receiving things because what if they'll blame for losing money for it. So instead, I would try to get high grades so it'll feel like i deserve it.

A suicide note i wrote last time i tried to commit suicide,"last year, when i was 14, I wrote a suicide note before attempting to suicide by overdose.

I tried to commit suicide because i was a closeted gay atheist in a really conservative muslim country and family. I tried to pray the gay away, I endured listening to a lot of homophobia and unfair religious teachings and i couldn't take it anymore. 

I wrote it in Arabic :

شعرت بأن الحياة لم تعد تطاق. بأنني اعيش في كذبة, شعرت كأنني قنبلة على وشك الانفجار في اي لحظة, شعرت بالوحدة على الرغم من اني لست وحدي, شعرت بان هناك خطأ في فكرة وجودي حتى, شعرت ان سعادتي تمثل خطيئة لا تغتفر و ان حقيقتي سر يجب ان يستتر. 

هذه الحياة كانت قاسية و غير عادلة, المكان الوحيد الذي ساجد فيه السلام هو قبري.

translate :

I felt like my life is unlivable, I felt like i was living a lie, i felt like a bomb that it is about to explode at any moment,  I felt lonely even though i wasn't alone, I felt like there is something wrong with just my existence. I felt like my happiness will be an unforgivable sin, I felt like my truth is a secret that must be hidden. 

This life is cruel and unfair, the only place where i can find peace is my grave.

Even though I fully understand all the problems that I have and I know how they’re affecting me but I feel like that’s not it, there must be something else, because if I know what’s wrong with me, It would make sense that I would be able to heal, but that’s not working even with pills.

I was once happy.,"Hey everyone, thank you for anyone who sets the time aside to read this. It’s greatly appreciated. I’m a 22 year old from Los Angeles, it’s 4 am and I’m being haunted yet another night by the thought of that I have lost the one person who had brought me any type of true happiness in years. I’m a college drop out, working a dead end job and I’m left reminded that no one else is to blame for this except for myself. I had a lot going for me, I had lived with this girl, was going to school and encouraged to go out and seek out what I wanted to do in life, chase excitement and pushed to do more. I was happy. For once in my life I was truly happy, so happy some days it terrified me. I come from an abusive home with a father who abused alcohol and used to beat myself, my siblings and my mom until his death when I was 9 then my mom as an immigrant had to take over the family restaurant and try to keep us fed. We grew up very poor, often times I would get made fun of for wearing off branded clothes or hand me downs. What does any of this have to do with my story? Well this shaped my dependence on alcohol from the age of 16 till the age of 18 which was when I met her, her name was Tyler at this time I didn’t see myself having an addiction but then one day I was introduced to weed by her and her father  for the first time and really enjoyed myself. From then I started smoking more and more often. Eventually Tyler and I moved in together and quite honestly I was the happiest I had been in years, I would wake up in the morning and be excited about the future then I’d look at her and see my whole world and that terrified me. My happiness scared me cause I knew it could go away at any moment. After a year I started drinking heavily again and my little fling with weed turned into a full on obsession to the point where I’d be out smoking for hours while my girl was upstairs waiting for me to cuddle her and fall asleep. One day she was fed up and found out I spent all my money on weed and alcohol and decided I needed to move back home and we needed to break up, mind you she had tried to help me before but I just wasn’t receptive. Now it’s hard to even fall asleep cause I still see her in my dreams, I miss her. I can’t even cry anymore cause I’ve spent so many nights just crying myself to sleep even though it’s been a whole year since it happened. I’m not the old me anymore. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m beat down, I’m hurt but I’m doing my best. That’s all I have to keep me going, the fact that I know no matter how much living right now hurts I’m still doing my absolute best, may god one day take the pain away.",bennycm99,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm3zkl/i_was_once_happy/

I’m tired of fighting my own brain every single day.,"Today was the first day in a week that I didn’t wake up to an immediate, debilitating panic attack that I had to cope (fight with every scrap of my being) my way through. I haven’t had an appetite in over a year, and every single meal since then has either been thanks to weed or an absolute fight to get down. My anxiety makes me vomit multiple times a week, which makes eating even harder. And it feels like as a natural conclusion of all of this, I don’t want to do it anymore. I know I have to, for my friends and family and everyone that would be impacted if I gave in, but fighting this hard every single day solely for other people is just so hard.

I am currently in a partial hospitalization program, which has helped a lot, and I have gotten my meds adjusted in a lot of ways throughout this fight. I want to win the fight, I want to get through this, I just want to feel like myself and get back to enjoying life again. But I feel like I’m only human and I can only fight so hard and for so long. I’m only one person, and I’m only 22 years old. I’m doing everything I can, and it has not been enough yet. 

I’d love to hear from people who have been in this position before and gotten through. I’m fighting hard as f*ck, and it feels like no matter how strong I try to be, it just keeps kicking my ass.

I used to not be useless,"I used to be quite smart... Aced everything in high school. Had best results from my school in maturity exams (European equivalent to SATs), used to do extra-curricular shit, like attending science-fairs, going abroad for competitions and shit, used to play the piano, play sports (I was in a pretty good shape) etc... I did well even during my first year of college. Then covid happened... I stayed home, got lazy, played video games all day, kinda stopped taking school and friends seriously...

2 years later and i am still in a slump. I somehow managed to not drop out, but nothing interests me now, I dont want to do anything, nothing makes me happy. Most of the time I am alone and just sit in my room and watch videos or play some shit, while procrastinating my duties. My grades got worse, my back hurts, I lost my shape, cannot run for more than 2 minutes.

I Dont understand why i feel this way.,"Recently, ive noticed that my hair started thinning (24M) and its been making me sad since. Especially that it happened to me at such a young age. For context, my older brother is already balding, and my dad is pretty much bald, so i guess i sort of already had a clue of what type of hand fate has dealt me. But it still sucks, and i am still in the process of TRYING to make my peace with it.

Ive never really considered myself to be emotional, in fact i like to think that i am a very mentally strong person. (As in i dont get realy bothered by things that much.). But just a few days ago, i broke down crying over my hair loss, this was probably the first time ive ever seen myself crying over something as mundane as hair, the last time i cried like that was during my mom's funeral.

With that having been said, i dont even style my hair that much, for me its just a thing thats there. So its safe to say that my attachment to my hair is pretty minimal (Or maybe thats just what i told myself over the years growing up with bald/balding people because i had to make myself feel safe? idk.)

As a young person (24) i started thinking about scenarios where i would never find a partner, or how people will laugh or look at me funny. Truth be told, i dont really consider myself unattractive, so i dont think my self-esteem or self-image is that bad. Although i have always been insecure about my height im 5'2, and even here in the Philippines, thats below average (average height here is 5'5). But the funny thing is, i didnt really have any desire to be in a relationship or find a partner, i never even thought about it once. Yet here i am now.

So the past few days ive been trying to internalize and process all these emotions. And i still dont understand why im reacting this way. Have i always been a vain person who likes his hair and just lied to myself to make myself feel better about the prospect of going bald? Or that i would actually very much like to be in a relationship?

Or is it because my balding has reaffirmed reality for me and made me realize that im not growing any younger? That i should make the most of my time while i still have hair and do the things that most people my age are doing? (E.g; Dating).

Or is it something else that i have overlooked?

What do you guys think? I didnt know balding could impact a person this bad. But its all ive been thinking about lately. Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post something like this, as i personally dont think i have depression or getting there.

Update 2: What have I been up to now,"Hi. Update two. I definitely go through a lot of mood swings throughout my days. Sometimes I feel pretty good but sometimes I feel very lonely and isolated. It doesn’t help that I’m extremely insecure about my appearance right now and I don’t even want to go out to social situations because I stress about how terrible I look. I just want to look good. I’ve been trying very hard. I’ve been keeping to a strict skin care regimen, I nearly cut carbs out of my diet in hopes it’ll help my acne, and I eat like 2000 calories a day so I can be shredded. It’s a little rough honestly, I’m a 6’4 male so that’s not a lot of calories to work with. I guess at least it gets me cooking because I can’t afford to waste any calories. I’ve gone from about 193 to about 183 in like a month though. I workout almost every day and I go very hard for over an hour. Non stop exercises. I feel lonely a lot, I want to talk to girls very badly but I don’t have the confidence in my appearance to bother. I know I’m ugly so it’s not like I’ll be able to go anywhere with them. Im trying to change it though. I just wish I had clear skin. Honestly, that would erase 75% of my problems. Anyways. I’m doing okay I guess.

I can't stop feeling depressed,"So I read about astrology and it explained my depression as a capricorn moon and stuff I guess. I am a woman but have always been goofy and girly all my life I never wanted to grow up or be sexual ever it made me so sad to. There were times I would bring cds on field trips with me as a kid and it was criticized because it was by girly artists and disney people while everyone else listened to rap music. Even now I prefer soft indie artists while everyone around me is listening to g eazy and rap shit. I like some rap, but I am picky about it. I would have my emotions always ignored and people just hyperfixate on what i wore and how i fuken looked. I don't like dating or sex because I attract very cold people and people are rough sexually and I just like sweet and sensual and soft things. I wish to be able to be more expressive and stay goofy but life is very serious and the outside world even on the day to day is cracked out and harsh. I see the craziest shit every day I step out; people getting caught on the escalators, a suicidal man wielding a knife at the train station, people fighting, crackheads and homeless everywhere even when I travel. Nothing is ever nice or pretty enough for me to post on instagram. Any time I opened up about emotions even now to people it's too heavy or I get wild eyed looks. Or people ignore me and just say 'i need d\*k' or to just get over it. People in the past would call me cold or selfish but when I tried to act friends or flirt I get called out for being sensitive or too nice. It's truly a crutch to even talk to people I just keep to myself and focus on ways on making money now not even a real career is for me I am all over the place and switch up whenever whatever. In the past whenever I announced something I was gonna do or be hopeful about people just look at me and rolled their eyes like tf did i do to you but when someone else did the same it was all positive. I am always seen as stuck up or just outcasted for no reason idk why even when I'm doing the same things as everyone else I get picked on still. People get mad when I joke around or laugh thinking I'm perfect, but when I admit something vulnerable or even just say something is pissing me off or sigh people look at me with crazy eyes or just suck their teeth. I'm always alone in having to pick myself up and dust myself off I watch a lot of youtube and tv to cope with reality all my life since I was a kid. After college I felt the world would open up to me and I'd be more stable and be around kinder people and easier energy but that never happened. I'm still in 'hood energy' and feeling even more like a child in a sharpened glasshouse. I still feel goofy and girly, I cut my hair short into a pixie and dress more androgynous/tomboyish with makeup still now but I feel sad in still having to hide my sensitivity so much. I tried to find ways of transmuting emotions into sex or work but it hasn't worked out for me because of how cold and harsh everything is and how angry people get with me when I act anything the opposite of grinding or being assured. I pretend to know things or be doing things when I just sleep at my mom's house for months and go months at a time without a job. I am very lazy yet always having side income somewhere. I turn 28 in the summer and have to get out of this 'the world is a harsh place and I feel sad because I can't cope with meanies and rough things' baby/teen phase when it really is just the reality of everything and I have to cope. I have to cope with being in ghetto areas and snooty people and being criticized and partners being cold at times and having to really do things alone. Humor helps but out loud and around others it is not always well received especially the older I get.

My birthday today was really shitty,"Hey Reddit this may be long and just me talking about random shit, but I just feel like it would make me feel better. So as you guys saw it was my 17th birthday today, and today was probably one of the shittier days I have. My best friend had a pretty bad panic attack today, and I chilled with him to comfort him, but it made me kinda realize how lonely I am. I have friends and a loving family but I just feel deep and dark loneliness. During most day I can kinda just ignore it and have mediocre days, but most days like today I just think about it. I don’t want to make it a big deal because my friend is going through some tuff shit right now and I need to help him as much as I can, but I just feel like laying down and doing nothing for a while. Obviously I can’t do that with all the homework and exams coming up but I just don’t know what to do. Like I was saying earlier, I just feel so empty when I’m by myself, and sometimes I feel like a have no personality, I feel like people only like being around me when I’m high, because I’m a lot more talkative and just more enjoyable to be around. I don’t know, it’s hard for me to talk to people about it because I feel like they might just blow it off or something and my friend deserves all the attention. I just feel bad that I’m feeling bad if that makes sense, like my friend is hurting and I feel bad that I feel so empty. I’m starting to think that life won’t have a lot to offer for me. I’m not suicidal or anything but I wouldn’t mind just like disappearing and just chilling on the top of a mountain or something like that.

Going nowhere in life because of depression OR am I letting it become an excuse that I can hide behind?,"I’ve been struggling with depression for basically my whole life, I wasn’t diagnosed with anything until a year ago but I believe it’s been a problem for me for the last 7 years. Im really getting frustrated with myself because I see where I used to be and the potential I had, and so does everyone else. Yet I’ve been struggling to get out of bed, can’t commit to school, I’ve blocked myself off from seeing friends for reasons I’m not even sure of. Long story short I’m not who I should or want to be. Has anyone else struggled with this? I know for myself that I really somedays cannot get out of bed BUT is this something that I can control? I want to be better for myself, I don’t want to have these reoccurring thoughts of suicide and self hatred. Am I using it as an excuse to be lazy everyday? Talking to my parents makes me feel like I’m just being lazy and I’m constantly comparing myself to my brothers who appear to be doing good in life.

My entire personality and life routine did a 180 this week. Idk what to do,"I think this is mental breakdown but over the past few months things have been slowly building up for me and I seem to have finally snapped last week.

My daily routine is basically wake up, shit, shower, brush, and sit on the PC until I go back to bed. I eat whenever I feel like it.

I know it sounds and it a shit schedule but it's like the ONLY structure I have in my life. As boring and shitty as it is it's always the one thing I can kinda find comfort and stability in.

Anyways, the final thing happened that made me snap last week. 

I now wake up and just kinda sit in my bed for a while, brush my teeth, go walk outside for an hour and then drive around for a few hours. Then I come back, shit, shower and the only thing I have left is to sit on my PC but it is borderline painful to do that.

Idk what it is but I just can't handle wasting my time on the PC anymore. I've more or less ditched my online friends and any games, videos, songs that I used to enjoy all day.

I want to be out of the house as much qs possible and dread the place that I've spent so much time in comfort.

Cancel Culture,"I know not many people will see this or probably care, but I have no one, or at least no one, who'll genuinely listen. A year or two ago, I wasn't the best person, selfish and careless. I was an alcoholic and a drug addict to deal with everything, which I know now was a horrible coping mechanism, but it was all my 16-year-old brain knew how to do as addictions ran in my family. I was hypersexual with no fundamental understanding of consent because all I knew was assault. I would get drunk and say horrible things, and my actions reflected that. I know trauma isn't an excuse for everything I did to people I used to call my friends, but I swear I never meant to hurt anyone. I was horrible, and when I realized how much hurt I had caused, I never let myself live it down. I couldn't look at myself the same; I would cry for hours because I was a monster that brought trauma to others' lives. I honestly didn't know how to be healthy, and I didn't know how to make real friends without making it sexual because that's all I thought people wanted from me. I know these are a bunch of bullshit excuses, but I don't know what to do. I never wanted to be this person; I left the school that was once my haven because of the rumors. I can't tell who I am anymore. Am I the monster they think I am? I barely remember anything, and I was always drinking, so it's all a blur.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a girl, I'm 17, and this is where it started. I'm not going to give my life story, just the bits that matter. I was accused of assault almost a year ago now with many other claims that had to do with my toxicity. The original person who accused me and I had dealt with it privately, and she had recognized that I was extremely drunk when it happened and the lack of communication on both ends. Honestly, I have taken accountability for the fact that I shouldn't have drank underage and made her uncomfortable. I remember bits and pieces of that night, some of it I can't even put together in my head. But I realized that my behavior was unacceptable, and it wasn't okay. Not okay in the slightest. But it got out to my whole school, rumors began, and people I had past romantic and sexual relationships with accused me of either assaulting them or being toxic. I left the school and sought a lot of therapy, but the rumors have entered my life in a more public setting. I don't blame anyone. I was honestly a piece of shit, but I know everything was consensual. But now I'm not even sure of anything, I think I'm a monster. I don't know what's real and what isn't. I was manipulative and a downright horrible person but I've done everything I can to change and apologize but I can't seem to do it right. I want to take accountability and be better but also want my name out there on the internet associated with these things. My parents don't deserve this. I want to be able to be normal again but then I realize my life has never been normal. I've always lived through trauma, my life is basically one big thing of trauma whether I realize it or not. I'm so sorry, I really hate myself for hurting the people I did. I don't want pity and I know nothing I can do can fix my reputation. I don't even think I deserve it, I really think I should just kill myself. I think that'd give the people I hurt peace of mind. I don't think I deserve to live this life. I'm really sorry, I know you'll judge me too, but I promise I'm really trying to be better and to help people. I'm not sure which perception is real, theirs or mine. I'm broken down, and I wanna be a kid again with my favorite stuffed animal.

A brand new level of numb I don't understand.,"I just hit something hard, I mean I've been numb before, the loss of feelings has even killed relationship. But after the breakup of the best bf i've ever had, numb has been more common (Keep in mind it's been abt a week so far) well lately with how he's acted and everything and because he even said so, I thought we had a chance to work again in the future (We broke up because he is suffering mental issues) well today, he told me he actually lost feelings, (I also had a small issue with a close friend over lying and smoking) and I flipped, all my past trauma clicked in right there, all the past exes and friends and just people who lied and left me, it all hit again. which it's crazy to me he triggered it but maybe it's because of the connection i once shared with him, but hearing that he lied when he said a couple days before that he still loved me and just was struggling at the time, and all the little flirting and care he's shown feels so contradicting to the point  everything clicked off, I cried it all out and the emotions wont come back but not even the emotions feel gone. I feel like I lost my soul. Like I was just blackout drunk my whole life and i just woke up and only recall blurry scenes from my life. And it's all gone.  I've distanced myself from a few close friends and rn only have my bsf and sister im Really talking to.

Emotional Blunting Without Medication?,"As the title says, I have been feeling emotional blunting and I don’t take any medication. I used to see a therapist but stopped months ago. 
I’m not even sure if this is related to my depression, but for some time now, maybe a month or two and more mildly for a long time before that, pretty much everything has been feeling dull. I’ve always had trouble crying and expressing/feeling my emotions in general, but now it feels like nothing can provoke strong reactions in me. Just a few weeks ago, it was 1 year since my older brother’s suicide, and I didn’t even feel that sad. I tried to find the emotions inside of myself, but I just couldn’t make myself feel the grief much. I also took a month break from listening to music since I felt like I was listening too much and music didn’t sound as good as a result, and just a few days ago when I finally listened to music again, I put on one of my favorite albums which used to always evoke such strong feelings in me, but this time it just felt empty.

I think my friend is suicidal. please don't ignore this I really need help and advice from people who understand.,"Ha. Oh god I don't know why I'm laughing so much. I think if I could feel anything I would be scared. I'm laughing and I'm crying I don't know what to do. I think my friend is suicidal. Scrap that. I know they are. And the problem is I'm kind of suicidal too. 


I see no point in life, but I've become sort of stuck in a rut of repressed emotions for a while. I feel nothing, so I have no desire to do anything, let alone to kill myself. But I'm worried they do. They said they would see me tomorrow,  so I don't think they're going to do it tonight. They said they want to, but they see no point, because they always fail. 


I don't know what to do. I cant ask for help for them because I promised confidentiality, and I know the pain of that trust being broken. I can't do that to them. That is not an option. I know they're safe for tonight. The only problem is I don't know how to make them feel better. Or if I can. I'm terrible at comforting people at the best of times, and now, I'm  half asleep and I think I'm a little triggered.

( for context My dad used to always tell me he was going to kill himself if I left him, and he would detail how worthless he was and ways he would kill himself and sometimes he would SH and almost attempt in front of me, as well as me being suicidal myself on multiple occasions, so it's a touchy subject)  

I don't need people telling me to call the police or tell anyone else. I need advice on how to make them feel better. I can't bear the thought of one of my friends feeling how I feel, or rather how I've felt. It's fucking torture, and they do not deserve that shit. They said they can't talk because they feel like an attention seeker, and I tried to reassure them but I'm crap at it. Please I'm begging you, give me some advice, something I can do to make them feel better. The thought of them in pain is agonising. They don't deserve that. I just need some ideas on what to do. What to say. Please. I want to help them with their depression but I can't even help myself. I don't know how to help.


I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. I've already posted this on suicide watch, but I need as much advice as possible. I've tried thinking about what I would of liked people to do when I was actively trying to take my life, but all I really wanted was to be left alone to die, and I felt guilty as hell when I talked to anyone about it and wanted to forget about it.

I do not feel alive, I do not feel like I matter, I do feel like I am in the way, and I do feel like my dreams are my only escape.

Lately I have had more anxiety or stress dreams tho...

Last one was about the world ending and everyone rich enough could get a ticket to go on lots of huge spaceships...
Ticket price was low enough for my aunt and uncle to afford it.
Left without a bother at all for me being alone.
It felt so strange seeing them board that ship and how little they cared...

The price was like... 700-1000 dollar per person...
Then added in was pets and I have 3 cats... cats cost 400 per cat...
I could not afford it...
So I was left alone.
Just watching ship after ship leaving.

Some malfunctioned and crashed...
It was weird watching....

Idk...

I think I might be disassociating or something because I'm restless like a panic attack and my heart is racing and my brain is off the rails but I'm also completely emotionless. I can't even make myself cry or smile or yell or anything. Anyone know what's happening? Any words of wisdom or love would be greatly appreciated because this is gonna be a long, scary night for me I think",Beefcake2397,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlwtir/panic_attack_but_also_not_really_help/
"I'm trying, but I don't think I'll last.","I'm putting every ounce of effort i have into keeping up with life.  Working full time, often working lots of overtime, dating, keeping in touch with limited friends and family, paying bills, doing all the chores, cleaning, hygiene, errands.  

I'm doing all the tasks that we're told we need to do.  My life is not harder than most, I'm not saying that.  But even still it's so much effort compared to what it could be if our culture were just slightly different, more aligned with valuing the fundamentals of what supports universal quality of life.

I'm putting in all this effort, I'm doing what I'm told i need to do.  And underneath it all i don't think I'm content at all.  I don't even know because it takes so much smothering of my inner voice just to keep up this lifestyle, that I can't tell what my real core emotional state would be.

If I were to peel off the layers and layers of rubber bands keeping my core tightly compressed and restrained, I worry that I would find what I'm afraid to find.  That I'm unequivocally and irreparably unhappy being alive.  That I'm inherently incompatible with what it means to do the mainstream track.  The college degree, the career, the crippling living expenses of late stage capitalist housing crises, all our favorite characters.

I worry that I won't like the truth that I find underneath it all.  That I'll never be able to rewind back to being in ignorance, back to pretending that I can go through week after week of this sick game we all play.  That I'll be left staring my inconvenient truth right in the eyes, locked inside my head with it and no distractions, disguises, or escape.  That would end me, and I worry it's what awaits.",MurrayTempleton,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm09w5/im_trying_but_i_dont_think_ill_last/
I like being numb.,I like not caring about anything. I’m at work all day just going through the motions. The long hours and annoying customers don’t phase me because I’m not even all there mentally/emotionally. Failing uni doesn’t phase me because..eh. I have to be numb because if not I’ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain. I have to swallow every bit of emotion so I don’t completely fall apart.,Wendellmaximov,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlj5k6/i_like_being_numb/
Depression and heartbreak,"My life was so promising and happy once, that one thing left and I feel like I’ll never get my innocence back.

Depression never goes away. NEVER.,"Growing up with an absent father and a mother who’s always attempted suicide (became a normal thing) and always used suicide as manipulation/threat.. A mother who’s always been depressed and always has had it worse than the rest of the world, I learned to despise anybody that plays the victim for long periods of time or cries all the time. Not even going to address the physical abuse part. 

I live accros the ocean from her and we barely even talk. I never miss her and I feel like I’m sick in the head because of that. She destroyed our family. All of her kids, including me, came out pretty fucked up. We (mom and siblings) don’t talk to each other and it messed me up pretty badly. I mourned, grieved and have become numb. This happened over the pandemic and since I came out. 

I’m currently engaged and have a hard time expressing how bad my depression is to my partner. I do talk about it but not about how severe it is. I think about ending my life on a daily basis. I attempted S in the past and regretted it once at the hospital. I don’t want to do it but the urge gets overwhelming sometimes. I hate that I’m like this, especially because of the impact my mom had on me growing up. I feel like it would be so easy to just leave.. I feel so unhappy in my life.. I try my best to feel alive but nothing feels good. Most days I don’t even want to wake up. I have to act normal. It’s exhausting!!!!! 

I can’t stand my partner’s sister/niece and the anxiety I get every time I have to see them or talk to them or even when I hear their voice. They always wanted me out of the picture from the get go because they loved her ex. Never gave me a genuine chance. It’s all acting and pretending in front of her and she is aware of it. 

My relationship has been rocky but we have a deep bond that keeps us together. I have hope we will get that connection back but for now it’s mediocre. Hoping therapy will help. 

I don’t enjoy anything in life and I really want to end it.. I won’t but I really really want to. I feel tired from my soul. 

Thanks for listening.",MEW018,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlwmdl/depression_never_goes_away_never/
Feeling like I’m living in the past,"Recently I have been feeling like I’m living in the past.

It’s a very weird feeling. I constantly think about my own death and how everyone around me that I love will also die. I will be doing daily tasks such as working and being at school, when I’m hit with this deep feeling of panic and anxiety. I could literally just be in a conversation with someone and I think in my head “Why am I seeing through these eyes?”

I don’t know how to bring this up with anyone. I guess I disconnect from myself and everything around me. I feel like I’m on some sort of psychedelic sometimes and that nothing I’m seeing makes sense or is real. I ask myself why am I seeing through these eyes? Why am I seeing in this first person view of the world? 

When I think like this it terrifies me. I have to distract myself with things like video games or cleaning to keep my mind calm. 

I think about death everyday and how everything I do really doesn’t matter because I will just be gone. Sleeping forever. I imagine what my dead body will look like.

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but I strongly believe I’ve been struggling with it for some time now. And recently, the past months have felt unreal. I think about everything so seriously and grimly. 

I don’t know what to do. Maybe I should talk to a therapist.",Aruzenchinn,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm05kg/feeling_like_im_living_in_the_past/

Today I think I’m happy.,"I think I’m happy. I’ve just went through a couple of months of sad dark feelings and thought. Best way I can explain it is a painful emptiness inside of me mentally. For most of my life I’ve always remember going through these phases. It never a on or off switch it just kinda slowly engulf me. One day I feel a little bit sad and it starts this snowball effect. After a couple of months of the constant painful emotionless feeling I keep getting the same thought of just ending myself.

But today I think I’m happy. It weird to explain but life seems a bit more vibrant. Music is touching me emotionally to the point I want to sing. I hope today is the start of my happy phase. And I really hope it last just as long. I’m so desperate to feel something again.",H_T92,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlwkb4/today_i_think_im_happy/
I’ve attempted more times than I can count,"
(Nearly an essay) 

This journey start 10 years ago. I was 16. I’d already been diagnosed with Premenstral Dysphoric Disorder at 13 for uncontrollable fits of rage and crying til I was shaking every day a day before my period started. At 15, they tried putting me on the pill. It didn’t help. But I was happy with my boyfriend. I was a straight A student. Beautiful. A ballerina who sang like an Angel. My boyfriend made me happy. He was my dopamine. I was happy and content for a year. We were finally at third base. He felt my boobs under my shirt, I put my hand down his pants and stroked him, he did the same to me. We never were unclothed. But we dry humped like teenagers do. I orgasm for the first time. The second time the third. We go to Disney World. I share a bed with my mom he sleeps on the other. When my mom goes to the bathroom in the morning we steal kisses. I cry tears of joy watching the fireworks with him in front of Cinderella’s castle. I love him deeply. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. And we were close to having sex soon. 

Then one day the next week in July, he called me and tells me “I just don’t love you anymore.” I was devastated. Utterly abysmal in every way. I beg him to explain. He has no explanation. I thought we were perfect. 

After crying myself to sleep every night, sleeping with my mom again because I couldn’t control my constant will to die, my mom started bringing me to therapy. The therapist told me to my face that I was the most depressed individual he had ever seen. A few weeks pass. Endless trials and failures of different antidepressants. I have a major panic attack. I’m screaming out to God on deaf ears “Please take it away. Please make it stop. I don’t want to wake up anymore!” This was the first time I tried, but stopped because it hurt.  I agreed to be hospitalized. 

“I don’t  want to die but I didn’t want to live like this.” 

They admitted me to the pediatric mental ward. It was HORRIBLE. The first thing they did was strip search me and check every inch of my body for scars or any marks. They pointed out a little white mark on my toes that scarred because of repeated blisters from dancing on pointe and being a ballerina. 

The girls there were violent. They had tried to murder their grandmothers. They had hallucinations of people speaking to them through the tv telling them to stab people. There were daily fights. I felt like I was in prison. Every night I screamed crying in my room. They told me I wasn’t allowed to do that. They told me I couldn’t cry. The doctor told me I was acting like I thought I was better than everyone else. I tell him I’m not like the other girls here. I don’t want to kill any one I just don’t want to live like I am living and want help. He is dismissive. I am released. Nothing is better. If anything it made it worse. Now I had trauma from my time there. 

3 months go by. I am in therapy and a psychiatrist office every week. I still cry every night. I still sleep with my mom because she’s afraid to let me out of her sight during the night. She holds me as I rock back and forth until I finally pass out. 

My ex boyfriend ignores me in the hallways. I mourn for him like the grief of a death, and I see his ghost every day. I wear high heels and dress to the nines everyday. All the boys notice me, but him.  I appear bubbly, beautiful, and like I’m a perfect girl, yet I am in agony on the inside. I stare at the walls during AP language just to try to fight the never ending dread. I go to the bathroom to cry. I have a student say to me “Why are you so happy all the time?!” in a mean tone and that “Just being around me makes him feel poor.” I run to the bathroom and break down. I call my mom. After 30 minutes I return to class. I tell the boy that my dad is a used car salesman who sometimes doesn’t even bring home a paycheck. I’m not rich and I’m not as happy as I may seem. Life goes on. I continue the charade. 

I get the attention of the foreign exchange student from Spain. I like him back, he’d be a good distraction especially if I could fall for him. He rides his bike over to my house we cuddle and watch movies and end the night in sweet kisses, we go ice skating. He asks me to homecoming by holding up a giant sign in my favorite class dressed up in a suit. I’m happy for a few days. Things are looking up. A little. 

Then I see that my ex has been asked to escort one of the girls on the homecoming court. That night, I break. 


I am screaming, crying shaking, banging my head against the wall hoping I’ll give myself a concussion and not wake up the next day. I run into my dads closet and press my back hard against the door to keep my mom out. I attempt again but it hurts. It hurts too much. My mom is desperately trying to push her way into the closet. My dad comes and eventually gets his hands on me. Slapping  me across the face and grabbing me by the neck and throwing me on the bed because he didn’t know how to stop me and it enraged him. 

He didn’t understand. 

I fought back. Once my mom was able to get him to let me go, I ran in the bathroom and locked the door. My mom calls and the police on my dad. My dad convinces the chauvinist southern cop that I was attacking him. I scream that I was defending myself! He says that he doesn’t see any marks on me and that he could just as easily take me to jail. The cop leaves. 

The next time I go into an episode my dad is violent again. I make sure this time I have red marks on my arms. I rub them where he’d grabbed me to make sure they are still red by the time the cops and ambulance get there. 


They take me to the ER with my mom. They let my dad off again. The next day I’m escorted by ambulance to a facility 3 hours away called PineGrove. Tiger Woods had gone there for his addiction. It’s really nice and they only take non violent kids. There I found help. They put me on Lexapro. Things started to get better. My parents visit and for the first time in my life I see my father cry. He tells me he’s sorry and how much he loves me and that he just wants me to be happy. I hug my parents. When the social worker comes I tell them that I made it up and that my dad didn’t hit me. 

I go home. The Lexapro puts me on a baseline. I’m not happy. But I’m not screaming in agony every night. My ballet keeps me distracted. I go to homecoming with my beautiful Spaniard boyfriend. I had told him and the other kids at school I had been in the hospital for an ovarian cyst. Eventually we break up. I never really cared that much. He tells people he only dated me to fool around and because I had big boobs. In reality all we ever did was kiss on the front porch. 

I continue on. My grades are immaculate. I start dating my boyfriend I had in middle school again. After he had a motorcycle wreck. I love him and he really loves me. He had PTSD from the wreck and is in a cast from the waist up. He self medicated. Our relationship is incredibly volatile. He wasn’t the Shakespeare quoting boy I’d dated at 13, now he was a leather wearing motorcycle riding bad boys. I was still ballet and straight A’s. We date for a year breaking up and getting back together every two weeks. I know he’s on drugs. He lies I believe him. Happiness, mental abuse, manhandling me, slapping me. Steroid rage. High on who knows what. He scares me sometimes but I love him and always get back together with him. He does really love me, we were each other’s first kiss before and first loves. 

I make a high score on the ACT and graduate early. I go to audition for musical theater schools. I’m accepted into NYU with a full tuition scholarship. I’m ecstatic. 

After a year together we start having sex. He wasn’t a virgin. He’d cheated on me multiple times. I was. I can’t orgasm. I’m embarrassed. I talk to my new psychiatrist reluctantly. Sex was taboo. I went to church twice a week. I was made to feel like it was reserved for you husband. I am very embaraased to talk about it. She tells me it’s a side effect of the Lexapro. We keep dating it’s June or so of the summer before I leave for college. 

He cheats on me again. He gives me an  incurable STD. This time it’s over. I break up with him. I’m devastated. I feel so dirty. He was supposed to be my forever. We have lunch one last time before I go to college. He gives me a beautiful Pandora bracelet. And tells me he will always love me. I know he will and so will I. 

I go to NYU. I don’t date for two years. I don’t want to tell anyone about my STD. My gynecologist says it’s alright that it’s now undetectable and that this type doesn’t transfer easily anyway from genital to genital because HSV1 really only thrives on the mouth. I haven’t had another outbreak. I eventually start to date again. 

2017 I meet a Brazilian billionaire. I fall for him. He could have easily fallen for me… but he held me at arms length. He shows love with his actions but he pushes it away. He doesn’t want a girlfriend. He loses his visa and I tell him… “You know you don’t HAVE to go.” He tells me “I am not ready.” I am heartbroken. 

I start trying to get off the Lexapro. I want to be able to orgasm. I do fine on Wellbutrin and Trintellix but the orgasms don’t return. I graduate. I’ve gained 30 pounds since high school “too fat” by Broadway standards at 150. So I work backstage. I’m exhausted. 6 days a week. I don’t audition. I have lost my confidence. I no longer think I’m beautiful like I was in high school. 

2019. I go home for the summer between jobs. I finally have a good relationship with my dad. I go back to work. My dad dies suddenly from a heart attack. He was only 66. I went home to stay with my mom for a month before returning for a new show working backstage. My boss is horrible.  

In October, I meet a man. He is also from South America, he is a brain surgeon on a brief fellowship in NYC for 3 months. I immediately adore him. But after 4 or 5 dates. I push him away. I didn’t want to be heartbroken like I was with the last guy I’d dated and I knew I would fall in love with him if I kept seeing him and then he would leave. He tells me around Christmas that he can’t stop thinking about me. He wants to come to Mississippi to see me before he goes back. I don’t let him l, but we text, talk, and FaceTime as much as he can being a full time neurosurgeon working at 5 hospital. I think he’s superman. He’s so charming and kind and sweet. I didn’t ever think I’d meet anyone more suited for me than the Brazilian, but I hope this might be it. We make plans for him to come to NY in April. I’d go to South America in June. 

March 2020…. The world shuts down. Broadway shuts down. Covid forces me to flee the city. I go back home to my mom down South. My family make rude remarks at Mother’s Day about people getting so much money on unemployment. It hurts me. We don’t leave the house except to go through drive throughs. I can’t see my neurosurgeon. I miss him. The next year is really tough. I’m grieving my dad. I can’t see the man I love. But March 2021, I find a GREAT apartment for $1500 in the best part of the city. A “pandemic deal” they call them. Everyone says that they can only raise raise your rent 5% each year anyway so I’d be fine. I’d made more on unemployment the last year than I had in 3 years of working. My mom comes up to help me move in. I climb on a stool to put a basket on top of the kitchen cabinets…. I fall and break my foot and sprain the other ankle. 

I go back to Mississippi. I can’t walk. I can barely go to the bathroom on my knee scooter because I have an injury on both feet. I have to have surgery. My doctor is rude and had no bedside manner. I feel like a number. Ive gained 30 more pounds. I’m 175. I see stretch marks forming on my body. I’m embarrassed. I hate myself. I don’t know the happy beautiful girl I was at 15. She is a stranger. In my cast I roll into my dads closet again. I can’t control it. I’m in agony is so so many ways. I’ve lost so much. I attempt again. It hurts. I stop. I make at least 3 more half hearted attempts that summer only leaving wells and bruises on my head. Unable to walk. Miserable and fat. 

I finally can walk. I get to see the man I love for the first time in person in 2 years. I tell him that I’ve gained weight over the pandemic at this point about 30 pounds. He says he doesn’t care and that I’m still beautiful. We go to Disney World. But he is different than the first time we were together. He used hadn’t been able to keep his hands off me in NY. We’d had sex 3 times a night without stopping. Now he wouldn’t even make out with me in bed. I feel unwanted. Is it my body? I ask crying. He says it’s just weird that we don’t really KNOW each other in person and he doesn’t know how to react. I wonder if he had erectile dysfunction. I thought this was going to be a honeymoon like trip. That he’d finally tell me he loved me, but no. We had fun, but we had quick sex one time that week. Despite my efforts and beautiful lingerie. I suspect he may be an autistic savant. Masking so well that no one except those that are closest to him can tell. 

I go back to work backstage when Broadway opens. They worked me 90 hours one week. The actors treat me like I am less than them. They act like I’m their maid and unimportant. I forget how much more talented I am than them. I sing like a nightingale and am a classically trained ballerina. They make me fell worthless. I sprain my ankle backstage. I’m already suicidal. I quit. 

Two days later. My ex boyfriend. My first love, the bad boy, overdosed on Spiked meth and died. I was devastated. I was already suicidal 

I can’t walk again. I have lost so much. I don’t want to work in theater anymore the man I love isn’t affectionate. I’m now 185 pounds. My stretch marks are purple and red all over my belly. I don’t have a job. I don’t know what to do about the man I love. He still plans to come in December. But I’m prepared for another disappointment. I can’t find the will to live. I start to prepare another attempt. I call my mom I tell her  my plan and that i can’t keep doing this and this will be painless. She calls the police. 30 police show up and involuntarily commit me to a psychiatric ward in New York City. She flies up. I hate her for taking away my choice. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I fake it to get out of the hospital. Tell them I didn’t have intent. I had even asked if the item was returnable when I bought it. 

I am out in 3 days. I tell my man what happened being open for the first time about my mental illness . He is distraught but as a doctor he understands I can’t control it. I get ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression. They help me to not be suicidal almost immediately. He comes up and my mom flies out the same day. They get to meet. My mom loves him. 

As soon as we were alone he rips off my clothes, I think this is going to be much better than the last vacation, but he is quick and I am dry. No foreplay but I just wanted to feel close to him and wanted him. I want him inside me forever. I want him forever. We have an amazing time together the next couple of days. I try to initiate again in the bubble bath but suddenly the water turning back on because I was cold completely takes him out of it. We go to sleep. The next night I dress up in head to toe red lingerie. A corset and long flowing robe. I look like something out of a magazine. I have my hair done in 1940s waves and professional level makeup. I light candles. I keep trying to kiss him. He doesn’t seem interested I demand to know what is wrong. I tell him I’m in love with him. He looks at me confused like he couldn’t possibly understand why I “thought I loved him.” “We haven’t spent enough time together for you to love me.” I tell him i do. I tell him I want to spend my life with him. I want his beautiful smart babies. I want him body and soul. And he won’t even have sex with me. I ask why?!? “Do you have erectile dysfunction? Are you not attracted to me?!” He says he doesn’t have a problem and that he just thinks the word love means that he’s ready to get married and we haven’t spent a month together in person, though we’d been in a relationship for 2 years. I tell him I want to be exclusive. He agrees. I tell him that I’d tried to date after he rejected me in Disney world but no one would ever compare to him. He understands and agrees that he doesn’t want to see other people. I am crying. I snap at him to blow out the candles. I go to cry in the bath tub. I know he hears me. I calm down eventually. I come out and he is rolled over. The candles are blown out. I wrap my arms around him and tell him that I want to work things out. And that because I love him I want to be there for him until he can get his license here. He rolls over and holds me through the night. We are happy. He makes me happy. I talk to my psychiatrist. We both confirm that there’s a high probability that he is autistic. I accept it. It helps me understand him better. 

I go home for Christmas. Omicron surges. I’m afraid to go back to the city. 
In January, I get word form my landlord that it’s time to renew my lease. They’re raising my rent $800. I don’t have a job. It’s perfectly legal. I am having my home ripped away from me. I start searching for apartments online I can’t job search in NY if I don’t have a place to live by he end of March. I find the PERFECT apartment. It’s a rare rare gem. Studio apartment with a backyard rent stabilized for $1100 in the best area of NY. Chelsea. But because I don’t make 40x the rent and my mom doesn’t make 80x the rent to be my guarantor I can’t get it unless I find someone who does. I call my aunt and uncle , my half sister, and my other aunt who all make over $100,000 a year. One by one they all respond “I have to think of my own family first and can’t be financially responsible for you.” I thought they were my family. I thought they would care. They knew my mom would’ve covered for me if anything had happened but they didn’t care they wouldn’t sign for me. I attempted to od.  I knew the chances of success were slim but I was desperate. I tell my mom I’m so sorry but I can’t do this anymore. I run into the woods behind our house. I keep running. I see them searching for me. I keep running. Eventually I find a long strong vine. If the pills don’t work.. this will have to do. I put down my coat to lay down for a while I feel weightless but my heat rate very high. I hope to die. But I get up to look for a tree just in case. Then they find me. The police. I had run 5 miles into the woods. They don’t let me go back to get my coat. The ambulance driver said I was lying that I what I took “ Your eyes aren’t  even dilated.” and that they’d spent hours looking for me when they had calls for people with actual emergencies. I told him to fuck off and find someone else to sit in the back with me. They hold me in the ER in a dark cell for hours. I am in and out of consciousness mostly from exhaustion. They tell me I had metabolized the drugs  from all the running. I am involuntarily admitted. The doctor in the ward is a literal sociopath. I ask to be transferred to Pine Grove. He denies my request. He takes me off my antidepressants cold turkey “just as an experiment” I look at him in the eyes and ask why he is smiling does he enjoy my suffering? He says “I’m just a happy person.” I say “ Are you sure you aren’t a sadist, on the spectrum, or a sociopath.” I walk out and demand he release me after my 72 hour hold. He practically ignores me for the next two days. They tell me I can’t cry again here, that I’m disturbing the other patients. I yell after the nurse that they aren’t giving me any help. What am I supposed to do??? She threatens to put me on the violent floor for people who can’t control their emotions for yelling at her. I go back in my room and continue to cry screaming and heaving at the top of my lungs. They let me out after my time is up. 

I tell call my man and tell him what happened. I see him start to cry. I tell him I love him again. He tells me “You can say it now.” He knows it’s real. He didn’t believe logically before but he knows. 

My birthday comes. I’m 26. I’m losing my insurance, my apartment, and I don’t have a job. I have to go back to NY to pack. I continue to look for apartments but the prices are too high. I hate my family for refusing to sign the guarantee and refuse to speak to any of them. My friends offer for me to stay with them in New Jersey. I don’t want it. I cry every night but I don’t have a choice I’m being forced out of my home. The place I had made beautiful and wanted to love for years to come. The realtors come to my apartment almost every night running salt in my wounds showing countless people MY apartment at the new price at $1400 more than I paid. I cry every night. I don’t get out of bed in the day. 
Out of sheer luck I get a job. It’s working from home doing very boring tech work. But at least I don’t have to get out of bed. My mom comes to help me move. I can’t do anything I’m paralyzed. I haven’t showered in a week or more. I eat microwaveable foods. I sit and cry while i shower. Everything sets me off. I look in the mirror and am disgusted at what I see. I’m at least 190 now. My friends make comments about my weight. I can’t even pack a box without having to lay down. My friends call me selfish for making my mom do the work. I can’t make myself. Now I’m staying with one friend until the others apartment is ready in her house. This friend tells me I have to “choose to be happy or go home to Mississippi, because she can’t have her son see me like this.” Im on my second day. Im miserable. My clothes don’t fit. I can’t find my clothes because my mother packed for me. The only thing I remotely look forward to is seeing my man soon. But I dread living in New Jersey with no independence. I don’t want to fight every day. I tell my mom I hate her for calling the cops on me twice and forcing me to live. I don’t want to. I beg for release. I beg her to leg me go. She won’t. SHE is the one that is selfish. I’m in agony. Every day is agony. Everyday for the past two years almost has been agony and I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to be in this body. I don’t want stretch marks. I don’t want a double chin. I don’t want to live in New Jersey. I don’t want depression. I dont want they anxiety, I don’t want the PTSD. And I most certainly don’t want to live. How come it’s my body my choice applies to abortion, but we can’t have autonomy on whether or not we can end our life peacefully? At this points it’s not about the feelings of other people after I’m gone. It’s too painful for me to keep existing like this. Nothing helps. My depression is a void that is never ending nothing makes me happy except being with my guy. But he’s 5000 miles away. I mask it as well as I can but these days, but I barely can force myself to smile. I’m tired of being called selfish. I’m tired. I’m just tired. I don’t want one response saying anything like “there is hope” because NO treatment has helped. I’ve tried everything for 10 years. I hate life. I hate the constant bad things happening to me. An endless barrage of bad. Moving? Let’s break her foot. Moving again? Let’s make her break her tooth in her sleep the night before from stress grinding. Find a perfect apartment? No one trusts her enough to be her guarantor. In love? He lives in a foreign country and won’t say he loves you back. I’m tired. I want the right to die with dignity. I don’t want it to hurt. My independence is taken completely away. I have no other options. 

I don’t know why I felt compelled to write this. Maybe just to share my pain. See how others cope. I don’t see an end. I tried to edit so that I didn’t break and rules mentioning methods. I’ve never told anyone all of this except my mom. I love her. But I’m so mad at her now for forcing me to stay.",RosalieJewel,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tm03g5/ive_attempted_more_times_than_i_can_count/
I need help,"I’ve recently been planning out my suicide. I probably sound like an attention seeker but I feel really terrible right now. I can’t get therapy and I have no where else to turn to. 

I was planning on attempting on the 31st of March. Right after my birthday. I’m so young, life’s barley started for me.

I can’t handle the stress. My parents don’t believe there’s anything wrong with me and they think therapist are corrupt people. All i can do is cry and hope things turn around for me.  

I live in an average neighborhood, middle class but just barley. All my parents ever do is complain about money. And recently my moms threatening to divorce my dad. Meaning I’ll have to go live alone with my mother who’s an alcoholic.

Huge Rant,"I think overall I'm doing ""better"" than ever but I feel like everyday I'm finding more and more reasons for suicide. I don't know, it's been fucking with me that even when I'm feeling good, suicide still sounds pretty fine but just in those moods, I don't feel like doing it. 

I've always seen my flaws but I've never felt so trapped by them. My inadequacy is further defining my life and its really hard to accept that.

I'm a fuck up in school. Getting a jerkoff, laughable major that will not feel like an accomplishment if I get it, nor will anyone respect it. Took 2 years of classes in an actual real major just to be proved to myself that I am in fact, confirmed, no question about it, fuck off if you try to argue this, retarded. Not to mention, I don't even have a minor to show for it, but everyone else thinks I do because imagine being so worthless and retarded that you waste 2 years and a bunch of money to fail out of a degree and not even have a minor.

I'm lying to everyone I care about because it would be too embarrassing to do otherwise. This just shows how pathetic I am and how much I am a piece of shit to my parents who are the best fucking people on the planet.

My mistakes keep coming back to cause problems so to every therapist ever, shut the fuck up about me forgiving myself. If the world can't forgive why should I?

I'm not excited about life. It's not even a depressed edgy thing it just makes sense when I think about it. It's not the stupid narcissism route of ""nothing matters in the end"" or stupid emo goth thing of ""life is pain"". It's just that, I don't know what to look forward to.

 I decided a while ago that I don't want a family for several reasons. As time passes on, I have less and less patience for people and I somehow have become even more selective in who I choose to be around. My hobbies are defeating me and I dont enjoy them most of the time. I love my family and friends, but as fucked up as it is to say, I've accepted leaving them long ago and they're not worth staying for. Traveling always seemed like one thing that would really make me want to stay here. But as I thought about it, whats so great about it? I mean, you go somewhere and look around at an area that's foreign and participate in their culture but is that A.) worth staying for and B.) actually worth doing? It's always food, do whatever quirk about the place, look around, and intake art. Just seems repetitive, unfulfilling, and boring.

My opinions on people have always changed between positive and negative, but some opinions have always sticked. A lot of people are unoriginal and bland, which honestly isn't a problem, except that means they're boring, and for the most part, disingenuous. 

The other opinion that's always been true is that they're annoying. Holy fuck are people annoying. They all just have their own quirk that sucks, whether its not shutting the fuck up, acting cringey, being uninteresting, being lifeless, being attention seeking, grabbing their personality and vocabulary from the internet (to the point where I don't understand them. No seriously, I had to ask someone to tell me what they just said in nonfucking tiktok speak and their body language slumped and they told me again in normal English all for an unfunny joke), or just overall being annoying.

I don't think I'm cool for thinking these things, in fact it's quite the opposite. I truly wish I didn't feel this way and I've been told by many people that its frustrating I'm like this.

This brings me to another thought which is that I am boring, unoriginal, and annoying. Seems pretty fitting, maybe I project onto people. But yeah, I'm all these things and I got proof. 

The boring one is pretty straightforward. I started to go to the radio club's parties and I often find people not really continuing to talk to me after we met. Theyre all really nice people, some of the nicest in fact, so the ""they're just assholes"" thing I refuse to accept. I mean I'm not upset with them. If I were dealing with a boring person and I can get away from them, I will, but if they come up to me I'll be nice but try to get out of that convo quick. Also my whole girls situation is another good piece of proof. Alright, we all do the match, snap, ghost thing so I'm not talking about that, although it does help my case a bit, but rather girls ghosting after a date. In the past 5 years, the best that I've done is have a girl hit me up every once in awhile because I think she either wanted to fuck (honestly didn't seem that eager to but it would happen sometimes) or because she felt lonely. Most situations are girls disappearing after saying they'd like to schedule another date. Again, I'm not upset with them. If I was in their situation, I can't bring myself to say no to seeing them again if they ask and I wouldn't know what would be a good exit plan. But yeah, this proves I'm not interesting enough for these people to warrant another date or just be friends which is what I'm fine with too (I also suspect that they do this because they realize how fat I am but that's a whole other thing).

The unoriginal part is evident in how I act, my manner of speaking, my thoughts, my overall personality, my sense of humor, and how I dress. Not really anything anyone could pinpoint about me that's original and I've been called a poser. Proof is in the mirror and hearing what others say about me.

Finally, how annoying I am. I've gotten this my whole life. I get it. I'm loud and obnoxious and that shit stopped being cute in 2nd grade. Even aside from that, I kinda just will be annoying when I'm talking. I think I try too hard in every aspect, humor, conversation topics, insight, opinions. There's other things too, but I'm tired and can't think. Again, the proof is in what other people say. We can't trust our own positive opinions because we are all wired to suck our own dicks that's why other people's opinions are crucial.

I guess I just thought things were suppose to be better. When I was younger, I never thought things would get better and maybe I'm right. But after getting meds and therapy, things did improve. Or at least that's what it looked like because now it just seems like everything still sucks but in a new way. It really feels like same depression but now in color. Everything seems new but foreign like I'm not suppose to be here. I mean I feel good some days, but those thoughts are still there. When I get low, everything makes sense and I feel like this is what's actually happening I just felt good at the time so it was blurred.

I really feel like I'm marching forward but not making any progress and with no purpose other than ""I'm suppose to"". I'm either hoping that I find a purpose for living or get the courage to stop. As edgy as that sounds and all this sounds, I don't think I'll ever find a solution or an end.",thingswontbeokay,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlzybs/huge_rant/

"My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but now I need a doctor lol","Coming from an Asian household, I've been told to become a doctor since the age of 4. The constant pressure for good grades led me to repeat my senior year of highschool, drop out of university, graduate from a local college, and then re-enroll to another program (then drop out) since my parents hated the program I graduated from. I want to thank them for the support they showed. Especially when they called me useless, dumb, an embarassment, and how they would disown me. 

Now I'm 28 years old with a fairly decent working from home job that I may get fired from since I've ignored my workload due to cycling back into a depressive state.

I feel strange.,"So.. I had a really, really rough childhood growing up. My parents were abusive to me, and I lived in an area where I got into a lot of fistfights. Trying to make it to the next day was the hardest battle. I attempted suicide by trying to hang myself when I was 15-16, I think. The attempt failed, however. It left me with some minor brain damage. I have a very difficult time trying to remember things and think about things sometimes. At times, it feels like I can't even read English. It just.. doesn't click with me. I'll sit and stare at it for like, minutes at a time, before I finally understand it. As for the memory issues, I have a difficult time recalling some things that have happened. I will completely forget about something that happened, say, 15 minutes ago, that most people would instantaneously remember. 


Anyway. So, I've been feeling extremely strange lately. I moved away from my parents after I turned 18, and now I live in a completely different state, and I am doing much better. But I feel like I'm still there. I feel the aura of my childhood house. It felt heavy, if that makes sense. Something keeps weighing me down. I'm also smelling foods that aren't being cooked, foods that I used to eat when I was there. I smelled a very strong scent of DiGiornio's pizza earlier, but nobody here was cooking it. I've also been sleeping in through the day and waking up at night, so this weird feeling is intensified by like.. 10 times. Everything feels so dreamlike and liminal, I can't tell the difference between reality and fiction anymore. Why doesn't anything feel real? Am I wrong to distrust my eyes? 

Has anyone else felt this way? It would bring me great comfort to know that I am not alone.",unindentity,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlw8ti/i_feel_strange/

The thing is that Ive always felt down/kind of bad, obsessed over a lot of stuff over time, mainly school and once my grade obsession wore down started getting obsessions nonstop, this led to me having high anxiety (even higher than before) and eventually not recognizing myself in the mirror, that and another bunch of stuff later I finally got into therapy and a psychiatrist, they gave me sertraline for the OCD-like symptoms and intrusivity on my thoughts (I have intrusive thoughts but those were way more maneagable than these) so it worked great, everything was going fine and better everyday, didnt stop getting better, I had an episode of hipo-mania caused by the sertraline I suppose, so after going back to half the pill (so 25mg now) and a new psychiatrist (my main one was sick), he told me thats what the episode was called, and recommended I get new medicine as people with bipolar disorder get that kind of stuff, Ive literally got no clue of what to do, do I get tested for bipolar and get new medicine? Do I stick with sertraline as it solved my main issue? Bipolar somewhat makes sense to me but I literally dont know what to do about it.

I am a classical musician, not from the US, trained in a conservatory since I was a child and over the years got to play and perform wonderful music in different countries, and finished two master’s degrees in the US. I graduated the last one just as the pandemic started and eventually married my US citizen boyfriend. The application for a green card is gonna take a few months (at least six) so I have no access to health insurance or Medicaid or really anything that isn’t out of pocket and super expensive. I haven’t had a single job or real performance in two years and my playing has declined over this time, which makes it even harder to find a job in the future when I get the green card. Not that there are any opportunities around me anyway, nobody seems to care about classical music. 

Im feeling like i spent so many years and made so many sacrifices (my childhood and teenage years and friends, for example) just to be able to play music that nobody wants to hear. I know I could play arrangements of popular songs but that just makes me wanna cry, All the hard work feels so wasted on that and it brings me no joy to play music i don’t like. 

On top of this, I have no support network apart from my husband, who is super busy working for both of us and can’t be the only one in my support network. Which I understand. I have no car and live in an area with zero public transportation, so I have been all winter stuck in the basement we have been living in. It doesn’t even have windows, so no sunlight.

They never go away.,"I am a Male within the armed forces and never really got the chance to speak my mind about a lot of things. I was always told by everyone thats Males shouldn't cry or even show a slight a bit of sadness or else it would redeem them weak. A little bit if background.

Before the Military I was a person that would always have friends along with people I thought they would appreciate who I am. Later on bad luck started to come around or at least I thought it was bad luck to this day I do not have any ideas why things happen around me or people I love. It seemed like every week or month or so I would go to a funeral that was among all my friends I made. Accidents, suicides, cancer or even by natural causes. So far I been to 24 funerals at this point and not able to cry or shed a tear. It seems like whenever I try to show an emotion to what has happened it never does, then people look at me like a monster and think I am a psycho or a robot. In reality I am lost in the void of either to try to keep or make more friends. 

Eventually I got to enlisting into the military to serve or find a purpose in life and eventually found myself in a deeper hole. I remember I had a platoon size or so group of buddies I drank and had fun with a brotherhood many would call it, A home away from home. That did not really last long, one by one they killed themselves due to various amounts of situations either it be from a divorce or just pure depression that dragged them to the ground. Despite all these things I came to the conclusion that I always will think I am a robot or even a ghost that senses nothing but just what goes on, Non human to the point where at one point I saw them paint their brains on the wall as I walked in to give them a well needed drink. My reaction was nothing and to just calmly report it to the MPs on base. (I am sorry Elijah)

Currently in the service still have about two years left. My wife at home with the dog, I do feel love for both of them. But for me? Not at all, I feel guilt in the fact of it all happening, like I am the bad luck charm, I been seeing what seems like people that I used to speak to and where alive around me at times. My old friends that could have been around but aren't. I am not much of a paranormal type person but I feel them watching me or even expecting me to join them at some point, a heavy weight on my shoulders if you will. I can't lose myself in thought or else they are everywhere so I keep it to myself and ruck on, But believe me the demons have learned how to swim after I tried drowning them with drinking, I keep going in life but what purpose what it be if I keep losing those I love? 

Whoever reads this, Thank you. To my wife as well, I love you and our dog despite my dark situation.

It feels like it's all my fault and I know it is. I just don't know how to fix anything. And these random events keep happening to me that make me question if maybe it is just some cosmic entity screwing with me because every time I tried to do something for someone else or tried just taking actions to do better somehow it ended up in failure. 

I tried getting a new job and I unfortunately my medical problems hit, causing me to lose that new job just a month after getting it. Prior to that I took a ""better"" job offer only to get hit with even worse working conditions for an additional $1.50, hence me leaving to try to get a new job. Or how about the two times I went Christmas shopping for my family, I had to replace two tires on my car. One each time I went out I mysteriously got a flat tire that went unnoticed both times, resulting in me having to buy new ones because the sidewalls were screwed. Or my favorite one, I decided to take a trip to another state on a whim one weekend for a concert. At that time I had felt that I was at the lowest I could get so I said screw it and decided to go. I decided to go out the night before to check out the city, and found a local band playing a bar. I ordered a beer and the next thing I remember is waking up in a hospital. They proceeded to then let me just leave the hospital and I wandered the city with a dead phone for a few hours looking for my car to go home. I got a lot of nice thoughts from family and friends initially but then the jokey, ""So you didn't get raped did you?"" and then just laughing it off, most likely because I'm a male. I honestly don't know if I did, I remember nothing, and I would rather it just stay that way. 

Everything I do in my life seems to result in the worst possible outcome. Whether it's my fault noticeably or whether I want to blame the void for all my problems. The outcome is still the same and my pile of problems doesn't change. I Just want to do right but I can't seem to do that. I want to give up completely. Every time I think things can't get worse they do. 

This isn't a final post or anything like that. I just want to scream. Everyone looks and talks to me like I'm some stooge and maybe I am but damnit I just want people to care. I'm trying but failing at every corner so I am at the point now where I don't do anything. I've sat unemployed with a friend as my flatmate for a bit now and I get the sense he doesn't believe my medical issues and I sense this relationship has also lost its end. I'm so lost. I don't know where to go from here.

How can people go along with...,"the phrase and concept ""it get's better \[eventually\]""  


How can anyone keep living without something other than that flawed statement? There's no trick or ploy here. I just don't get it. I'm tired of trying to convince myself that idea has merit (or is at least worth pursuing for myself.). I'm tired of leaning solely on that because time after time i can't find anything in this world to look forward to, anything to believe in, to want.  


Maybe no one will read this post, maybe everyone(hyperbole) will. I know I don't have a flashy premise. I know I'm just some random person the average scroller doesn't have to get attached to or invested in because they may never hear from me again. I know this question is gigantic and a colossal ask to any one person.

i feel no excitement anymore, im just constantly working on arbitrary goals that i set for myself so i don’t just lay in bed all day. call it “high functioning.”

i don’t really want to keep doing this whole thing. i’m tired, and over it. and i’ve gone through too much shit this past year and I am still dealing with ptsd and SA stuff and i just feel like i don’t want to deal with it anymore. i want to give my life to someone else and go live on a beach somewhere.

Does Anyone Get Intense One Day Storms,"Hi;  I was wondering if anyone has this happen to them.  I have have had depression for decades, I have good days and bad days.  No periods that last for weeks, or months, like I did when I first started having symptoms 40 years ago.  Thank god it is mostly occasional bad bouts, most often I just have a dull low depression that I can dell with using, moving muscles, using cognitive disputes.

Today I had one of the rare events that I used to get often.  I wake up early have a cup or two of coffee, yet I feel really exhausted.  (I slept fine the night before).  I end up having breakfast, but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and I go back to bet by 9AM.  The entire day consists of me sleeping, having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dreams.  The dreams are not nightmares, in fact they are rather creative, but the locals and situations are like the came from somebodies imagination in a distant galaxy.  They would make really interesting sci-fi fantasy.  I also dream about being lonely, I have no family, few friends, one thing I remember was this gut wrenching sadness about a girl I dated over 40 years ago, thought she was the one, but it fell apart.

After about 10 to 12 hours I get up, have something to eat.  I feel hung over, an d it is like a storm passed through my brain, spent it's energy and now calm has returned.

I was wondering if anyone else had had similar experiences like this?  It would be concerning if it was a frequent occurrence, which it once was in the early days of depression, again that was decades ago.

bipolar 2 falling into another low swing,"I can't stand the constant shitty feeling of depression in my chest head and stomach. Idk how to put it into words but  pretty sure every depressed person knows what I mean. I can't shake the feeling and everything is starting to get under my skin and send me into such a downwards spiral of overthinking and overanalyzing everything. So much to the point that I overanalyze feeling sad in the first place and minimize my own feelings.

I'm not motivated to do anything except sit around like a blob and waste time and space. My fiance is a blessing and does so much to make me feel better but he can't be my savior. And it's been so hard just to get through the work day and go through the motions

I love him so much but I think it’s beyond repair. I want to starve myself and die. I was so close to doing this about a year ago but my parents and boyfriend forced me into gaining weight. Now I think I will resent them forever. Even though I love them. Everyone said I would be happier once I gained weight but I feel worse and want to die a lot of the time. Nobody would even care if I died. Not enough. Also my therapists are fucking useless and so are my antidepressants. My therapists don’t even know I think about killing myself cause if I told them they’d probably send me to a fucking hospital. I can never be honest about how I feel with them. Or with anyone. And when I am honest I ruin everything. I repress my feelings and then have anger outbursts and hurt people.

I'm Thinking I Might Have Smiling Depression,"I've felt like this for a bit but never super realized until I looked into a depression as I've thought more and more recently that I might have depression. I've just kind of been watching youtube and shows recently not doing anything I like recently I haven't had any good motivation to get up and do stuff like playing video games even though I want to I just can't get myself to. I've been failing school I can't motivate myself to sit down and even do that which I really really need to do, and I feel bad for it too since I haven't done really anything and my mom stuck her neck out to help me. I've just about always had good grades up until spring of last year I think. I'm always happy when out doing stuff around people basically but I'm not always feeling that way I've just kind of been feeling off and a bit sad. I want to reach out to people but I don't have the courage to do so even if they're a relative or a close friend I don't want anyone feeling sad because I am and I'm just kind of trying to keep people other than myself happy. People have asked me sometimes if I'm ok but I always respond with I'm fine; sometimes I know like at the beginning of conversations I sound a bit sad which is why people ask if I'm ok but then I kind of just go to a normal somewhat happy tone. I don't want to really say I'm depressed cause I think it's just my own fault for being too lazy and I know recently especially I haven't been getting to sleep really at a time I should just cause I don't feel tired basically ever so I just stay awake and sometimes force myself to sleep I'm not really ever crying which isn't very depression like which is guess is kind of why I've just thought for awhile that i don't which I probably don't I'm sure I'm exaggerating but I don't really get to a point where I feel sleepy and then when I do go to sleep I sleep for hours and even if I do set alarms I wake up but I'm just not motivated enough to actually get up so I usually just fall back asleep but I just haven't told anyone up until now especially not irl until now but even this has taken some courage to admit even to myself but i probably didn't say everything as im just kind of piecing stuff together in no specific order or anything and just ramblind on but I'm sorry this has been long thank you for reading and have a nice day or night

Is there more to life than physical beauty?,"Everyone I have ever met in my life has told me that I'm beautiful. Some, even the most beautiful that they have ever seen.

All my life, I've expected the rest of the world to bow down before my beauty and tell me that I'm beautiful. I always rely on that validation and reassurance. I keep on waiting for people to tell me that I'm beautiful. I keep track of who tells me I'm beautiful and who hasn't. For those who haven't, I wonder if they think I'm beautiful.

This happened with my 50 year old same sex female teacher. I was expecting her to tell me that I'm beautiful even as she was rejecting me, and I noticed that she didn't tell me what I wanted to hear, and just pointed out aspects about my personality. I was crying over it.

My own thinking has led to me having many problems in life. I lack even the most basic common sense, even when something is so obvious. Like, flying to Germany and showing up unannounced at the airport asking to be picked up at 11 PM and expecting to free load for two weeks with relatives I haven't seen in 17 years over Christmas. Being invited to a friend's birthday party and not even talking to her and wondering why she became cold to me.

Even at work, When toothpicks fell, I was picking them up to put them back on the bottle. I was stacking clothes that they kept on falling. My coworkers who are younger than me helped me and their minds are more mature than mine. When my former professor 40 years my senior told me he loved me and that I was the most beautiful woman he has ever met, I was blown away. I was so distracted by him telling me that I was beautiful that I could not see that he could have been lying.

I have received a couple of complaints about my personality. Someone told me, ""Yes, you are beautiful in looks, BUT UGLY AS HELL AT HEART. You are narcissistic and manipulative. You surely do act like the world revolves around you. Another person has told me, ""You told me that you are 27. When I was talking to you, I felt like I was talking to a 16-year-old. You are a very immature woman, and you're not that bright either."" Is this why I don't have any friends?

Depression,"I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember really. Some days I’m sad for absolutely no reason. That’s how today started. Now I’m in my head and I’m more depressed than I’ve been in a very long time. I hardly ever cry, I haven’t cried in probably months. I’m crying right now. I’m fucking sobbing like a Lil bitch. 
•My boyfriend is in jail. Not sure how long. Months? Idk.
• I live in our house with our 11 year old. (He’s my sisters kid but I have custody)
• My best friend has depression, and her boyfriend struggles with drugs and she works a very full time job. She doesn’t reply much to me anymore. I’m not mad at her, I know her life it very tough and she struggles with depression as well. I’m just sad because she’s my go to person and now I’m lucky if I get a reply.
• I’m 30 days clean from Fentanyl. So the chemicals in my brain probably aren’t in the greatest shape.
• I miss my other best friend. I saved all of our videos and pictures. She was my best friend from around 2016-2018
I was in a very toxic relationship and she constantly tried to break us up, rightfully so. Once I finally broke up with him...the girl and I we fine, we were great! One night we went to a party and then the next day I went home and wrote her a long text telling her she was toxic towards her boyfriend. We got into a huge fight. Then they started stupid rumors about me trying to get with her bf. Wasn’t true. Then...I went 100 steps too far. I got with this new guy who was total GANG GANG and a snow addict at the time. I knew a window in her house was broke and could always open. While she was at school my new man and his friend robbed her house. And by rob I mean only took the bongs and weed. That was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. The whole time it happened I sat at home have an anxiety attack because I wanted to tell my man nevermind but I didn’t want him to think “less of me”. How fucking cool of me. I have a very guilty conscience and I’m empathetic as fuck. I ended up telling her the truth. She already knew, she’s not stupid. I knew she wanted to kill me the moment I confessed to her face. A week later I ended up giving her $200-$300 to make up for what was taken. I hoped she would want to continue our friendship but it was over. I don’t blame her. I was the toxic one all along. I needed to do deep soul searching. Well now it’s 2022...and that happened 4 years ago. I still think about her everyday. I miss her more than ever. I love her soul, and that’s rare to find. I’ve been looking at all our old videos/pictures that I saved to my eyes only on Snapchat. I have hundreds of snaps of us. 
My point is...if anyone is actually still reading...
Do I try to message her on Facebook?
Or should I just be happy that she was apart of my life. Did I forever ruin what could have been? 
I feel like I’m just getting through everyday, not living. 
I’m prescribed very strong sleeping meds. I’m tempted to take a couple but I won’t. I’m tempted to walk to the gas station and drink my sorrows away but that’ll only make things worse.

Can you have survivors guilt if no one actually died?,"(Delete if not allowed, I posted in the ptsd sub but didn’t get any responses and figured this was a similar sub)

I was in a pretty bad car accident about a month ago where I was hit by a driver going 50 mph when I was at a full stop on a freeway in a tunnel, and I was pushed into 2 other cars and my car basically crumbled. Since then I have been having horrible anxiety attacks driving to work, I’m super lightheaded all the time and on edge when out and about, but the part I’m really confused about is how guilty I feel about it all. I don’t understand why nothing horrible happened to me (aside from my life being screwed for like a month and having a totaled car). I go back and forth between blaming the guy who hit me and getting really upset about him, to thinking maybe I deserved it in some weird way. Even though I was 100% not at fault according to all insurance companies, drivers, and police involved. I spoke with a chat therapist and they said it sounds like I have survivors guilt and PTSD, which both sound so…. intimidating to me I guess? I feel like I can’t really have either one because no one actually died and I was the one with the “worst” injuries which were extremely minimal in comparison to what could have happened. 

I feel like I’m just being dramatic because my parents and girlfriend both said I need to find a way to get over it, that I’m really lucky I survived, and that I was being selfish for feeling alone throughout the process.

Really far behind at work due to depression.. FMLA?,"I've been struggling with motivation to do anything work related for the last 6 months or so because I'm depressed. As a result, I'm super far behind on a lot of stuff. My manager hasn't really noticed because I'll get the things done that they need. But I'm in a really bad place, mentally, this week. And I have done almost no work on a big project that I need to finish by tomorrow. I've been debating going out on FMLA for the last few weeks. But I have to use up all of my vacation time if I do go out. 

I've been seeing a therapist weekly and I've been on Wellbutrin for a month. My doctor just increased my dosage yesterday. It really hasn't done much for me up to this point. Do I just take FMLA until I get my depression under control? 

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I hate disappointing people, but this depression is debilitating.

You haven’t figured yourself out until you know you can be happy on your own.,"Idk who’s going to read this, but it doesn’t matter. I’m only writing this for myself. I always had friends growing up. I wasn’t the most popular kid, but I had my small group. Recently, some drama happened and I’m no longer in the group. I was wronged, and I will play the victim because I am. I don’t have any friends now, I haven’t got a few years. I fell into a terrible life style. The only thing I do with my life is go to college, work, then rot in my bed consuming media. It took a while, but it hit me during one of my breaks away from school and work. I realized that I have nothing making me happy. I wake up, and go on my phone watching random shit all day in my bed. At night, I’m afraid to sleep so I just consume media until I can’t stay awake any longer. I recently started think about what makes me happy, nothing. I have no interest to pursue, no friends to talk to, no life to live. I’ve seen everywhere that in order to find yourself, you should start a hobby based on your interests. That’s bullshit coming from people that don’t have these problems. I don’t have interests, no hobbies appeal to me. Saying “find a hobby that interests you” is like me telling you to start a hobby that you don’t like. I don’t like anything anymore, I don’t know who I am and I don’t know how to find myself. Being betrayed by the people closest to you is a blessing and a curse. I know they weren’t real, but I also know loneliness. I can’t crawl out of this state because I’ve got nothing I want to do. How do I become curious. How do I start to desire things again. I’m so lost. I don’t even know if I have depression or something, all I know is I’m constantly hurt unless I’m consuming media. Being idle just hurts. I don’t know where else to say this.",Wooden_Tour_1844,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlm9vs/you_havent_figured_yourself_out_until_you_know/

Struggling to keep up with my parent's expectation.,"My father is very smart, he has so much achievements in his education and he always graduated top on his class. His dream profession was to become an engineer but because they were poor he was not able to pursue it, back then he would always persuade to become an engineer. Now I'm at college studying engineering but I am struggling to keep up with college, whenever I share to them my struggles they just expect me to easily overcome it. I cry every night thinking that I am just a failure and a disappointment to my family.

This has all started when I was still in elementary and have been reaching as top in the class. I was introduced to the computer and got hooked by it. I basically grew up in high school facing my computer most of the time, I would no longer study and just play all night long not knowing the impact it that would cause me today. My habits have completely changed, I became malnourished, my education has deteriorated and I graduated high school not knowing how to add a simple fraction. 

Now I am at college I am struggling to keep up especially math and I have a failing grade, we have a programming subject and what I have realized is that I actually feel happy when taking the lessons. I have been thinking to change my career instead, but I know my family would not agree. I have so many thoughts right now about what ifs, but the urge to just end my life is too strong because I know at this point of my life I have no chance to succeed. I have been thinking about this for weeks, I have completely lost my faith and motivation, I am disappointed in myself knowing if I would continue it would only get worse.

It just hurts and I want to write it down somewhere,"I don't know if this is the right place, but i just want to get this out of my system somewhere and a journal won't do. If it doesn't belong here please delete. My girlfriend and I are in an open relationship. We both agreed on it and I never had any problem with it. But after 4 years of trying I have had zero success while my girlfriend can basically choose. 

And it hurts. It hurts seeing her choose other guys over me. it hurts knowing she'd rather spend time with them than with me. What hurts the most is seeing her being happy, listening to her talking about how exciting it is, how much self-esteem she gained from it, and thus knowing that if I ever tell her that it hurts me, i'll make her sad. And I don't want to make her feel said, even if it means crying myself to sleep while she is having fun with our friend. It's not her issue though. She is always asking beore and afterwards if it is okey, checking in on me and she would stop this instant if I would tell her about any of this. But I know it would still hurt and limit her, losing this part of her life. And I can't and don't want to do that. Because I know that if I loose her, my life would get miserable. I'd most likely stay the rest of my life alone and die alone. I'd lose almost everything positive in my life and I'd rather die than having to live 60 miserable years alone.

I went to the hospital for SA in January and had to go back only a month later for SH and alcohol abuse on my campus. Usually when I get depressed, however, I get really really sad or destructive towards myself, or I reach for weed or drinks to keep me from thinking about things, but tonight is different.

"Not sure I’m technically depressed, but have an event that I can’t get over","
It all started a couple years ago when I was 23 about to start a new job. I was lucky and bet that the stock market would go down with the few thousand dollars I made from my internship. Of course this was when Covid was just hitting so I became hugely profitable. From only a couple thousand dollars to $2m in value in only a month. Thinking back on it, I was crazy reckless. I made my first million, and then less than a week later I made my second million. I was feeling incredible, thought I could retire and never have to work again… but like all gamblers I kept putting my money in trying to make more and more. Of course with the risks I was taking eventually it would all come crashing down.

Fast forward today, I’m now 62k in debt plus another 20k in student loans. On the surface, my friends think I’m hugely successful because I flexed I made $2m to them (didn’t spend a dime though, just kept trying to make more and more). I also make $200k a year (100k salary with  the rest as a one time bonus) but only have $2 in my bank account currently.

I no longer play in the stock market but have recently been doing sports gambling. Of course, I keep losing money on that. There are times that I go on a nice streak, but it’s like every time I lose, I keep trying to make back my losses which makes me do even dumber plays.

I’m not sure what I’m expecting by writing this, but I feel so embarrassed to tell the people I’m close with. My girlfriend of multiple years knows that I no longer have a lot of money, but don’t know I’m in debt. My parents are super supportive, but I’m too embarrassed to tell them how bad my situation is.

I guess that’s why I’m writing to a bunch of strangers online. I know my pursuit of trying to make back my money is wrong, but I can’t stop trying to get out of debt. I feel so dumb, it’s like I see a rock in front of me but I keep on tripping over it.

It feels like I’m slowly unraveling and feeling incredibly hopeless. I can’t sleep thinking about how my life has gone downhill in such a short period of time. My younger self would be straight up embarrassed if he could see me now. I don’t have suicidal thoughts yet but no longer feel the same motivation in life that I used to.

How am I supposed to believe that things will get better and people won’t be better off without me,"So My latest suicide attempt, I sent a goodbye text message to a group of my friends. I then planned on overdosing, until I got a call from my mom and a bunch of text messages saying “don’t do it” and implying that things will get better and no one would be better without me yadda yadda. After listening to my mom I didn’t go through with taking my life. I ended up in another psych ward and to top it all off I got covid. I hate being inpatient, but to be confided into one room with someone watching me all the time made things even worse. The only good thing was they made an exception to the phone policy for me. For whatever reason, the psych there wouldn’t give me an essential medication because he “didn’t like it.” Needless to say, I was an utter wreck in the ward, and who could blame me. I admittedly texted some concerning stuff to one of my ex-friends because of how much stress i was under. (It wasn’t anything manipulative, mostly self-deprecating stuff) I believe these texts sent him over the edge and he has now decided to cut ties with me. This was one of the people who said “no one would be better without you.” Him cutting ties with me has made the other people in that friend group also cut ties with me. Because of this decision that they have all made, it has confused and fucked me up so much that I had to go home for the college semester and am attempting to do school online from my house for the upcoming semester. I’m still extremely suicidal and so depressed that I can barely book a therapy appointment. So now to my question… how am I supposed to believe that things will get better and people won’t be better off without me when things are 10000x worse than they were my last suicide attempt because all my friends have left me. Like I find it so ironic that they said all that shit to me only for them to abandon me and knowingly make things worse for me.

"Not depressed, just that life is worthless","I'm so bored with life I know it's not worth living. I don't have anyone to hang out with or do things with so all I do is go to work and stay home. I'm an adventurous, outdoorsy and outgoing person and love getting out there and doing things but I have no transportation and don't know how to ride a bike. I can barely afford to take Lyft and Uber to work and back home. My life has no excitement to it and there is nothing interesting about it. Everything is pointless. Like I work in a grocery store as an order picker, for example and what's the point of helping people shop for groceries they are going to need again the next week?? It's the same thing day after day and week after week. It's all pointless. What we do today won't matter in a month or year. I'm just done with this whole life thing. Sometimes I get legitimately pissed off for the simple fact that I was even born and not aborted. I wish every day my birth mom aborted me. Now I'm just a worthless sack of shit taking up space and sucking up air. I have tried making my life worth living by moving to a warmer climate, getting a better job and starting my own business but the excitement of it all wears off. Everything turned out to be a flop. I can't do anything right since I don't belong here. I firmly believe my existence is an accident, not they type of accident of an unplanned pregnancy but like I was never meant to exist type of accident.

Do I have depression?,"Hi. I’ve been focusing on my mental health recently and I think I have depression. Here are my symptoms:

1. I am constantly irritated. I do not like any human interaction whatsoever. For some reason I just don’t like dealing with other people. This varies from day to day. I don’t know if it’s from past experience but I can’t stand other people physically. 

2. I have no energy. Finding interest in anything is an arduous task for me. I am happy for those close to me that achieve or accomplish something. But I just can’t express it. I notice this because I don’t smile or act happy when it happens.

3. I have no motivation. I am financially confident but I don’t see the value of my work. I don’t know that to do with the rewards I have earned with work. 

4. I sleep a lot. I probably sleep around 10hrs a day.

Not sure how to approach anything anymore,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

I just graduated with an advanced degree and got into job search. I've been struggling with depression for years, and I think at first it was the high-functioning kind, but in the last few years it seemed to have turned to the demotivational kind of depression. I'm tired all the time, and I always pick the easy things to do: easy entertainment (watch things mindlessly), easy way to go to sleep (scroll on my phone until I'm too tired to stay awake), etc. It comes and goes in waves, too. Sometimes I'd get the energy to do things or to do something along the lines of self-improvement. Other times, I would just want to sleep. 

I've learned that some things trigger depressive episodes much faster than others, but I'm not sure how to let these triggers pass without the episode full-on hitting me. For instance, one of the triggers is a perceived sense of being excluded from things or being ""rejected"" or being shown or told that I'm not good enough. Can you tell that I suffer from an inferiority complex? Anyway, today, that trigger came from one of my tennis-group friends, who wanted to set up a play session every two weeks for advanced players in our amateur tennis group. This doesn't conflict with any of our other scheduled play sessions, and I know that I'm not good enough to be in the advanced group. All of my tennis friends are good people, and I know that there's always going to be room in the advanced group for people who improve and get to that level. Even knowing all this, I got so depressed over the span of about 3 minutes that I just stopped functioning. I think that since this group of friends has been my only real support for the last few years, anything that happens in the group that I see as a rejection of myself just instantly takes me down. Now that I'm in the middle of it, it feels like the only thing I can do is wait for it to pass, because ""talking out of it"" or ""building myself up"" don't work when all I can think about is how I've failed everything and that I've never and will never live up to anyone's standards, including my own.

Sorry for the long selfish post - I'm struggling daily with Imposter Syndrome and a sense of inadequacy. The trigger just happened to be this particular thing today.",throwaway_deepspiral,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlb9a1/not_sure_how_to_approach_anything_anymore/
I haven’t slept longer than 4 hours at an time in 8 months,"I live at home, and I love my parents but I’m beginning to spiral. 

After an incident 8 months ago I’ve been profoundly depressed and stressed out, I was renting but moved back home to save money while trying to get myself back in order. 
Especially because my meds stopped working.

I’m an only child and my parents have no friends, so, now that I’m back home all they want to do is constantly talk to me.

I already have poor sleep as it is, but it could be 5am and my dad will shake me awake to talk about a car, or his work day-
Or my mom will come in and talk to me about my finances or why I never talk to her about my mental health.

it took me 2 hours to call my doc,"So I (24m) have been feeling down rather often the last few years, but these last few month im feeling constantly down. My life just feels stuck. Everyday when my alarm rings i just cant get out of bed, even tho i usually sleep for 8 hours or so. I end up laying in bed for 1, 2 or 3 hours, thinking about how shitty my life is and how i dont make progress at all. I also get suicidal thoughts alot, even tho i dont have any intention to harm myself in any way. I dont want to die, but smh my brain doesnt get that.

So yesterday i decided to finally get help and call my doc for an appointment. Before making that call i sat there and stared at the number, contemplating if i really wanted to do this. I made a list and wrote down reasons why i want to get help and reasons why i dont. Everything just pointed to me making that call and after 2 hours i finally pressed call.

So then i was on the phone with a woman at my doctors office. I told her with a kinda shaky voice that i would like an appointment. She asked  what it was about and i told her that i felt rather bad lately had trouble sleeping and am feeling tired alot(i didnt feel comfortable sharing that i feel depressed). She said she doesnt have a free spot in the next few weeks and told me i should come in without an appointment on thursday or friday.

So now im here without an appointment contemplating if i should actually go there tomorrow. It kinda sucks, that im in the situation before the phonecall again, where i have to make that decision to get help. 
Im so nervous about getting help. I dont know what i should even say. I dont know how to talk about my feelings. I dont even know if ill make it out of bed tonorrow, before the doctors office closes.

Im so afraid about revealing this about me, but i dont think i can pull myself out of this without help. Can someone maybe give me some kind words and share their experiences with finally opening up, so my anxiety about this comes to an ease?",Sadapple83027,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkyenw/it_took_me_2_hours_to_call_my_doc/
Noticing progress,"So I've been working really hard this last year on overcoming MDD, agoraphobia, and social issues. Over the last 2 years, I've gone from making it out of the house for 1-2 hours a month(long enough to go to the doctor and grocery shopping) to managing 6-10 hours a week. I'm still working up to doing things on successive days, it usually takes a day or so to recover otherwise things start getting rough, but it's significantly better than before.

(Not advocating this approach, it's what worked for me and may not work for others. I had a lot of sensitivity to what was being prescribed and it was causing more harm than good. Talk with a professional before doing anything medication related). Part of what seemed to help was getting away from medications. Over 6 years we tried 14 or so different things and it just didn't work well. Now the hardest thing I do is caffeine and multivitamins.( There is a noticable difference in energy levels and depression if I go more than a few days without vitamins, so if you aren't taking any you may want to look into them). 

I had been pushing things the last couple months, and was starting to have burnout issues. It was hard not to as I felt like I was starting to break through things. I'm working at a different approach now, just going until I start to feel uncomfortable and stopping if it's feasible, rather than pushing until I have a full panic episode. I'm not getting as much done every day, but so far I'm starting each day more consistently. Its a little difficult stopping when I feel like I can keep going, but I'm hopeful that the better consistency will be more productive in the long term. 

As bad as things were a couple years ago to where they are now gives me hope for others too. I was going to bed praying for death and cursing every morning I woke up. I have hope and have truly started to love myself. If you're going through a hard time, things can get better!

I'm at the end of my rope,"For the last 30ish or so years, I've spent most of my days wishing I was never born. My first suicide attempt was when I was in 2nd grade. I held a giant kitchen knife to my heart and stood in my kitchen daring myself to fall over, and honestly if it weren't for the pain it would've caused my parents, I wish I had.   


Nothing has any meaning at all for me anymore, and honestly never has. I'm afraid all the time. I feel like complete shit. My anxiety has gotten so bad I can no longer work, which was the only way I ever contributed anything. I hate myself. I hate myself so much, if I could go back in time I would shove that knife so far into my heart without a second thought. I wish I had the strength to take myself out of the picture, but accomplishing anything has never been my strong suit. 

My wife just asked me if she could get me anything and the first thing that popped into my head was ""A gun and 1 hollow point bullet"", but I'm too weak to even take that step.   


I have stage 5 kidney disease. I can't work, I feel like garbage all the fucking time. Last year I passed out and broke my face. I can't stop thinking about blacking out like that again and never waking up. I fantasize about it every day. 

I'm a burden to everyone around me, and if it wasn't for my son and the fact that I'm incapable of accomplishing simple tasks anymore I would totally take myself out. 

I have friends, but none that I feel like I can talk to about this. I'm so alone. I can't do this anymore.   


I'm seeing therapists, I've gone to partial hospitalization for anxiety, nothing will work though because I'm totally broken and unfixable. I'm not worth fixing, nor do I know how.   


I haven't done anything terrible to anyone or ever hurt anyone. My life is just empty and it always has been.

Feeling tired and alone and wanting to give up,"I am 30. Married 8 years this October, and a four year old about to start school. 
None of this matters when I'm expected to pick up the slack for my family and their failings. 

My sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My parents have no idea how to deal with it, having lived with chronic depression their entire lives and relying on faith to get them through. She's refusing treatment, medication and in denial of her condition. It's a constant cycle of her being unstable, hospitalized until shes able to manipulate the doctors that she's okay and goes home to torment us. 

My brother is leaving his military job after 16 years and freaking out because he doesn't think he'll survive as a civilian. I'm fairly certain he has his own mental issues, stemming from way back but he's also just barnacled on to me for guidance. 

I wanted to kill myself. I was about to. And I called and got help, and I've been on medication for 4 years. I struggled with alcoholism in my early 20s and decided to stay sober for my daughter.  And I'm finding it hard to hang on with all of this going on. I'm finding it hard to help people who don't want to help themselves but if I don't, then everything just goes to hell. And I'm the one to blame because I'm the smart one and have to guide everyone where they're supposed to go. 

It's exhausting having to care for people who refuse to accept they have issues. I feel like I'm being punished for being the only one in my family for having had the fortitude to acknowledge my mental illness. It's taking a toll on my marriage, and I am scared of the consequences of what that would entail.  I worry for my child, because if I can't take care of myself, then I can't take care of her. 

I'm staring at the same abyss that was before me those 4 years ago when I was spiraling. And I don't want to be here again.

pls help,"im 14 y/o my mom died when i was 9, and ever since then ive had no motivation to do anything. I used to be into sports a lot, (football, baseball, basketball, track) and i was pretty good at it too, but ever since my mom passed.. i just cant seem to be happy fr. people always ask me why i gave up, why my grades went down, why im not how i was 5 years ago. When i go to school im a pretty popular person, and i'd like to think im a pretty funny person and fun person to be around, but when i get home im alone.. just me and my thoughts and its literally killing me. Ive thought about killing myself multiple times and im sure the only reason i haven't is because i couldn't put my father through that...please give me some type of advice, i honestly dont think i can do this any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

i posted this under a different subreddit about two weeks ago, i took the advice people gave to me and it didint work. everything just feels like it wont get better ; no matter how hard i try. i genuinely feel like theres no escape and that killing myself is the best option. people always say ""oh you need to do what would make your mother happy""... okay and what about what makes me happy, i wanna play sports AGAIN SO BADLY but my dads to scared to let me because he doesn't want me to lose sight in my other eye. to be honest football, basketball, and baseball where some of the only things that made me happy, and now that i cant play them it just makes everything worse. i just miss my mom, she was the only person that made me happy really, and i really didnt even get that much time with her.",Additional-Tadpole60,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlr1jb/pls_help/

"New country, same me","Hey everyone, I recently moved to another country for work. This seemed like the best option due to lack of options in my own country. The move came just after various treatment facilities to manage addiction which I believe was a side affect of my depression.

My experience in this new country has been hectic. No one can speak English so making new friends and connections are so difficult. I have found myself wallowing in this. Outside of work I pretty much just sit in my apartment feeling really sad.

Last night I had a dream that pushed me to a new low this morning. The dream pretty much had me in a group of friends having a good time (I don't remember any of their faces), there was even a girl that I remember making me feel loved.

I understand and respect that being with someone with a mental illness is really hard. I have done so many things that would totally justify leaving me.

My moods are very unstable and I hate living like this,"
My moods change fast and I don’t think I am bipolar as it’s usually a reason why my mood changes and it can all change in a day. Like I’m in a good mood and then like couple hours past and I just get negative thoughts and I’m down again. 

Like I already lost people this year, my ex best friend, who used to be my best friend like 2 years ago and losing him as a friend this year didn’t really hurt as it was my decision to cut him out of my life. He was a real bad narcissist and probably a sociopath so cutting him out felt good. The one thing that hurts is losing my sister as we used to be so close but recently she became a lot more social and has a lot of friends and she doesn’t even want to speak to me or spend time with me anymore even though I’m the older sibling. I’m 23 and she’s 20. 

It’s just scary how easy people can just leave your life and even though I have a best friend that is good to me and I am talking to a girl but I’m just worried it will end as I’m just bad with my emotions probably because of my anxiety. 

I’m really not sure how I can get better. Like sometimes I feel great it feels like euphoric even, like I’m more hyper, talkative and confident but it never lasts long. And then I’m just back to my usual mood just being sad, depressed and anxious. I know somethings wrong with me probably, I tried cbt therapy for anxiety and depression but it didn’t really help me. I’m on an antidepressant as well which has never worked on me I just take it as it makes me sleep. 

I hate living like this I just want to smoke weed and get drunk so that I can stop all the negative thoughts and I hate it. It feels like my life is a mess. It’s so much effort to get out of my bed and I just hate my life like wtf.

"Feeling no interest, nor pleasure","I really struggle with depression and increadibly miserable thoughts about myself and what I do. I also struggle with realising what I like or enjoy doing, wearing, watching, etc. In a few words: I struggle with knowing my interests. I feel no emotion for life at all. I just see myself doing everyday stuff I need to survive as a human being. 

Do you have any suggestions on how I can help myself on speaking much better about myself and what I like, sth to enjoy and be interested in? Like... Should I tell myself, repetitively, for instance: ""I enjoy dancing."", rather than: ""I just do it because I have to, because some people say I do it beautifully, but I'm not sure about it (or I don't feel good about it)."" Should I write down everyday sth like, for instance: ""I write well"", ""I read well"", ""I like writing"", ""I enjoy writing"", instead of: ""I just write beacuse is needed at work, because I have to"", ""People use to say I speak well in front of people, but I just do it. I don't feel anything.""?

It's known that depression steal us the joy of life and everyday existance, it steals our curiosity in everything.

I leave everything because I feel no interest on it. I just want to feel engaged in sth, I'm exhausted of not feeling anything good, but I have no money for therapy atm.

Thoughts that have plagued my mind for a long time now,"I am so tired of living. I don't think I've been truly passionate about anything since I was 12 years old. I am turning 21 in a few months. Mentally, I still feel like I am 18 years old. 

There are so many experiences and opportunities that I have missed out on over the years and it's so difficult to imagine a future for myself after college because I don't have the energy or the motivation to do anything but the bare minimum. For the longest time in high school I didn't have plans for college because I didn't see myself making it past 18. I feel like I am presently existing past my life's expiration date. 

I chose to pursue fine arts in college because drawing is the one thing I am genuinely talented at, and yet I dread every moment I have to sit down and draw. This semester, I shortened my course load to two online classes and one in-person class, and I am still struggling to keep up. It's incredibly difficult for me to focus on anything for more than 15 minutes before I feel exhausted. I have been told that I am talented enough to sell prints of my art yet I can barely make pieces to add to my professional portfolio. I'm too afraid to let myself think about what I am even going to do once I graduate because I know this disorder has completely destroyed any semblance of a work ethic that I may have once had. 

I am slowly losing all my friends because I can't do anything ""fun"" anymore. Two of my closest friends who are also my roommates don't invite me to anything social anymore. I am saddened by this but wonder if I even have the right to feel that way, as I probably wouldn't go if I was invited as I don't have the energy for anything anymore. I shortened my course load to two online classes and one in-person class and I am still struggling to keep up.

"Feedback Wanted - One Day Depression Storms, Sleeping, Lucid Dreaming.","Hi;   I was wondering if anyone has this happen to them.  I have have had  depression for decades, I have good days and bad days.  No periods that  last for weeks, or months, like I did when I first started having  symptoms 40 years ago.  Thank god it is mostly occasional bad bouts,  most often I just have a dull low depression that I can dell with using,  moving muscles, using cognitive disputes.

Today  I had one of the rare events that I used to get often.  I wake up early  have a cup or two of coffee, yet I feel really exhausted.  (I slept  fine the night before).  I end up having breakfast, but that exhausted  feeling becomes overwhelming and I go back to bet by 9AM.  The entire  day consists of me sleeping, having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dreams.   The dreams are not nightmares, in fact they are rather creative, but  the locals and situations are like the came from somebodies imagination  in a distant galaxy.  They would make really interesting sci-fi fantasy.   I also dream about being lonely, I have no family, few friends, one  thing I remember was this gut wrenching sadness about a girl I dated  over 40 years ago, thought she was the one, but it fell apart.

After  about 10 to 12 hours I get up, have something to eat.  I feel hung  over, an d it is like a storm passed through my brain, spent it's energy  and now calm has returned.

I was  wondering if anyone else had had similar experiences like this?  It  would be concerning if it was a frequent occurrence, which it once was  in the early days of depression, again that was decades ago.

My go to foods while having a bout of depression.,"Everyone here knows it’s difficult to do anything while depressed. Even getting out of bed or brushing your teeth can sap all your strength. Appetite usually goes out the window as well, which leads to low blood sugar, exhaustion etc.  Here’s what I reach for when I have to “force” myself to eat.

1. Any type of smoothie/shake. 
I usually use a low glycemic berry, oatmilk and kale or spinach. Protein powder is good also, to add a bit more calories. Chia seeds for the fiber, to keep you satiated longer.

2. Bone broth or soup.
Again very little prep time and you’re not actually eating, just drinking. Bone broth alone has very little calories, but the protein content will help your malfunctioning brain work a bit better.

3. Any type of nuts or seeds.
They pack a ton of calories in just a handful. Doesn’t feel like you are eating a meal, no prep time.",mantrasandmudras,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tl9w60/my_go_to_foods_while_having_a_bout_of_depression/

I don't even give a shit about my past anymore. But I have nothing left in me. I don't have anything to fight for even out of spite. The world sucks ass. My life has had plenty of shitty times and a handful of good ones. But I'm at my final limit. Rent is due again in about a week. After months of being unemployed, I still have no job. I interview constantly. I research how to be better. I have a degree. I have applied to anything and EVERYTHING. I'm practically begging for work now. And still... nothing. I have no money left. I have no family. I have applied at jobs I'm ""qualified"" for with all of my experience but also grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, anything that says it's hiring. 

I'm not going to be able to pay my half of the rent next week and when I think about it, it makes me so ill that I'll puke thinking about how am I going to look my partner in the face and tell him that I just don't have any money left? He has seen me struggling. He knows I haven't had a job since November.

I have credit card debt. I don't spend any extra money ever. I have food stamps. 

I think about ending everything every day. All I do is try to not cry constantly. I can barely muster up fake smiles anymore. I have never felt so down in my entire life. I feel as though I have been cursed. But even then, that would give me hope as that would mean it could be broken somehow...maybe.

I have never felt so close mentally to believing, truly believing, that I wanted to die. I just don't want to face this. I really can't exist like this in this life anymore. I don't see a way out.",PotterFlowers,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tlkitj/im_officially_checking_out/
I am struggling hard,"I feel empty inside most of the time, i am trying to find my purpose to live again but it kinda hard. For the first time ever in my life i feel like I can’t overcome the struggle I’m facing right now. I am telling myself im doing okay, im doing better. But at the end of the day, I found myself drinking and smoking by myself again(i stopped smoking for a year and a half until last month). Me right now is exactly the person im trying to get rid of 3 years ago. After 3 years I found myself doing all the things i hate and i know it is bad for me again. My best friend’s birthday day is today, I asked her “hey what do you want” ask a thank you because she was there for me when i am facing my first panic attack, first time understand what’s depressed. She said “i want you to live that’s all i need”. For people out there who is having suicidal thoughts like me, just remember that there will be a person who expects to see you in the future.

Don't know what to do,"I've never been good at talking to people about how I'm doing, and most of the time I'll just tell everyone I'm fine and move on. I have a very close friend, and they're the only person I've ever felt comfortable talking to. I trust them with absolutely everything and we've helped each other through so much. A week ago or so, they told me things were changing and they've sort of left. We barely talk anymore, and they told me they're still gonna be here for me but I really just don't feel it anymore. It could just be my head making it seem a lot worse than it actually is but it really feels like they don't care at all anymore like they used to, and it seems like they just don't even wanna talk to me anymore. It hurts a lot to think that. I used to always text them or something when things were bad just so I could have someone to talk to, but now I don't really have that anymore and I don't know what happened.

I almost went on a date today,"I’m 20, and have never even been on a date with a girl before. Everything has just gone wrong growing up. There were so many times where things almost changed, almost got in a group of people I wanted to be with, almost would no longer have been alone.  But every time, something at the last second happens and I lose it forever. Sometimes my fault, but usually not.  I’ve stopped getting my hopes up for anything. I know it will always just never work out. It’s like I’m destined to just always be like this.

I had a few “friends” in high school.  No one I could ever connect with though. I didn’t care though, maybe I could meet new people through them. But for some reason, anytime anything interesting would happen with them, it was when I was gone. Anytime I am with them, same usual boring shit. I’m not there? Something crazy happens.

I started going to college recently.  I really was hoping doing this, I would meet people, make friends.  But even doing things, like going to events and regularly attending classes, just nothing.  I love talking to and meeting people, but I just never get placed in the right place at the right time.  And the moments I get close, I fuck up again, or something else happens.

I downloaded some dating apps just to try to meet people. I know I wouldn’t have much success, as a short medium attractive guy.  I would maybe get a match a week if I was lucky, and we’d send a couple messages, but nothing more.

Last week, I finally got someone’s contact info, and we set up plans to go on a date. I wasn’t particularly interested in this girl, but was just exited to finally go on a date. I had a class for the time we planned, but that didn’t matter. I can miss it. Things were finally going well.  And then last night, I suddenly remembered.  Nothing is ever supposed to go well. I always get so close.

So this morning, I check my phone. She had blocked me. I didn’t even feel anything. “It’s just how everything goes for me”, I thought.  I’m not angry at her or anything. She probably just decided last minute she didn’t want to go.

I’m tired. I’m done trying. I’m killing myself next week. Maybe if I keep putting myself out there I’ll actually meet someone. But it’s an endless cycle. My depression makes it so hard to do that, which just causes me to get more depressed. What is supposed to break this cycle. I’ve tried medication, no effect. Therapy? I’ve tried may therapists and they’ve all told me the same bull shit I’ve already heard. 

I don’t really want to die. It would be nice for things to work out for once.  But with the cycle I’m in, nothing will ever change, and I don’t see a way of breaking it. If things will just be like this forever, why bother continuing.

Sorry for this absolute wall of text. If you actually read this, cool I guess. I just needed to write all my thoughts out.

Jealous and Loneliness,"I am just jealous of so many things I don't have. Depression destroyed my memory and I can't remember anything.

Every time I see people learn I feel jealousy, that they can do things I can't. The jealousy appears also when it comes to my two friends. They both have other friends than me so they can leave me anytime they feel like it. They also don't talk to me that much and spend more time with those other friends. They also wanted to do something nice to one of my friend and didn't even invited me to spend time with them. It just hurts. I tell myself ""I just need to meet more people either online or irl"" but it's hard and I'm just trying to ignore my true feelings. I was always there for everyone since I can remember and all I get in return is being ignored and forgotten. I started to think about myself more and now I'm ""rude"" and ""only thinking about myself"" but I don't care, they are not the kind of people I want to be friends with.

My inner demons are winning. How do i fight them ?,"Hey everyone,

So the title says it all. Been going through depression since i was around the age of 13, currently i am 26 and beginning to lose to my demons. This often pushes me to take things to the extreme. For example, if i want to achieve something, then i become obsessed with it and go ""all out"" so to say, otherwise i feel dead inside. People think of me as this ""strong"" individual, because i have never shown my weakness to anyone, even my family, so everyone is oblivious to my inner suffering. It's a pure living hell.

It's like having rabies, but instead of dying, it constantly attacks your brain and makes you think of irrational things day in and day out. I don't have anything to brag about in my normal life. Average job, no education after high school, no car, no girlfriend, no friends, no money to go on holidays - nothing. The only thing that i got going for myself is my gym addiction, built a decent physique over the years and planned to actually compete. Ironically, i had all of these things minus the money part when i was in high school.

Lost the ability to smile as well. I laugh at jokes, at funny things, but my heart is dead. I became unable to form relationships of any kind, whether they'd be romantic or friend related. Just recently lost my business too. I am in debt on top of that. How do you fight demons who always drag you back down to the bottom of a dark,empty ocean every time you start seeing light at the end of the tunnel ?

Thank you for reading.

Then what? 

This whole idea of life is so boring. I hate that I keep looking so far into life, so analytically. Thats how depression makes me see everything, analytically. And it is exhausting because I can NEVER truly, truly enjoy something. 

I know life can be beautiful and fun at times, in the moment it can be. But I don’t know why it’s just not enough for me. There HAS to be something else to life. Something better. There has to be more, right?

How am I supposed to do this everyday until I die? That is such a long time, I don’t know how long I’m going to last.

Thinking like this makes me the literal most boring person ever. I feel bad for my ‘friends’ (the few I have). I’m so boring. I never put passion into conversations because I seriously do not care enough because none of it matters, and it’s all pointless. I feel so bad.

My life is perfect but only on paper,"From an external point of view, i have the perfect life.

A failure.,"The title sums up my whole life perfectly.

  
I was born to a loving, caring family. My father is my personal hero, a real masculine role model, who taught me pretty much everything I know. My mother gave me all the love a child can ask for. They were always supportive in all the good things that I used to do (but always very strict about the bad things).  
When I chose a career path, they paid for a private school (which I'm so grateful for, high school was the best time of my life), they supported me in sports (I used to be an amateur middleweight boxer). I love them both dearly.

That's why it hurts so much. Knowing that I'm nothing but a disappointment, a burden, a leech to them. I made the worst decision possible. After I finished high school, I got accepted into the best technical university in my country (it is so embarrassing to think back about it now, i actually thought it was an achievement.) to study (I'm ashamed to even type this, be free to laugh) software engineering.  


I can't explain how a person can do something so stupid. I only recently found out that most programmers and software engineers with a masters degree (Which only about 15% of students finish) make minimum wage, if they are lucky. (I'm from the Czech Republic, central Europe.) Programming is a dying career here, everything is getting outsourced to the East, jobs are disappearing left and right. Moving to a different country is not an option, since I don't know any foreign languages (except for English, which I'm really not good at, as you can see. And most positions require you to know the language of that nation anyway, if you want to work in Poland, you got to know Polish, etc.)  


It's soul crushing to think that all this hard work is worth nothing and even if I manage to finish my degree, I'm gonna be making the same salary as people with no education and skills whatsoever.  
The minimum wage here in Czechia is not enough to afford even a 1 room apartment, so I'm either gonna live in my parents basement for the rest of my life, or I'm gonna end up homeless, if they decide to kick me out, and probably freeze to death when it gets cold.  
But then again, I'm the only one to blame here. i should have been thinking more when choosing a career path. It's too late to change my profession now, firstly, because of all the money that my parents invested into it (I feel like crying writing that) and secondly, because I know deep down that I  can only do this, that I would be a complete failure trying anything else.

The moment reality of my situation hit me, my life took a bad turn. As you can imagine, having those thoughts every day just ravages your mental health. I can't sleep properly and there are sequences of days when I don't eat anything. I'm losing weight (i would be a lightweight boxer by now, but I stopped training anyway), my grades got worse. I get feelings of despair and misery every day. I don't smile anymore. I get no joy from anything. All my friends are gone. I'm very lonely.  


I'm invisible to women. And I completely lost interest in pursuing relationships (no woman is ever gonna date a homeless software engineer). I can't remember the last time I had morning wood. I'm never going to have children. My bloodline ends with me.

It’s only getting worse.,"A little over four months ago, my relationship of over two years ended. My partner left me for the person they told me they couldn’t ever love more than me, and that I had nothing to worry about. I trusted them and they destroyed that. 

I moved back home, all the while they gaslit me into thinking it was my choice. Once I got home, almost a thousand miles away, I began to spiral. My family was in the midst of drama between my aging parents (one struggling with memory loss, the other with alcoholism). My dog from high school has also begun declining, and will be crossing the rainbow bridge any week now. 

Following the breakup, I struggled with alcohol and substance abuse for several months, which I’ve only just begun to get control of. I was sexually assaulted twice in the span of two months. My relatives have died of COVID. I’ve been unable to find a good job that actually uses my degree in the time since moving home as well. 

I find myself unable to form meaningful connections with friends or family. I can’t be open with anyone because I don’t feel I can trust them. I’m worried that anyone and everyone could leave me at a moments notice. I can’t get my ex off my mind and the feelings of inadequacy and abandonment are staying strong. I don’t feel the ability to love. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, but it’s my first time posting here, and I guess I just need to know that I’m not alone, and that I can stop spiraling and live a good, fulfilling life. I need to recover from the fallout of what’s been my life for about 4 months now.

Fear of depression,"Today was a normal day. I have started keep  a to-do list to tackle my depression. It not always necessary for me to everything on that list provided I have some definite reasons in my mind to not doing everything. Like okay I didn't cook today because the gas connection wasn't there. Also this list has helped me with my medication as sometimes heavy doses makes me feel forget to do small stuffs.
But something's left from the list undone and I don't have any particular reason for that except spending extra time resting or etc I feel horrible. And then a fear started to grow back of my head, that if I don't keep with that list I will again fall in depression.
Today after work I took some time off for myself. Then my boyfriend came over and we spent some quality time. But it also made me let for cooking my dinner. And as I planned to go for cycling after dinner, now I am constantly feeling horrible for not striking off one job from my list. And the absurd thing is I haven't even had my dinner yet. So I am already freaking out about something which probably I will have time to do.

"I Keep Getting Worse, Not Better","I'm a 26 year old man and I'm in the worst state of my life right now. I started out my adult life by dropping out of college after 2 weeks due to depression and severe anxiety and getting $10,000 in debt.

It took me 4 years to pay that and my car loan off and I was finally back to even financially. I spent thousands of dollars trying therapy, medications, chiropractor for my back issues and nothing helped me. I've tried exercise, healthy diet, yoga, everything I've ever been told to do to get better and it never helped me long term.

I've been working dead end jobs ever since and barely scraping by each month while my body and mind deteriorate. I have so many untreated and likely some undiagnosed health issues and I barely have the energy to do my laundry once a week anymore and can't do anything else productive. I am too anxious to leave my room and even be around my roommates I've known since high school.

I feel like I'm never going to escape the poverty loop. I finally broke even 4 years ago when I was 22 and now I'm back $5000 in credit card debt stressing me out every day. My car broke down and now have to Uber around town making my finances even worse. I failed at any goal I set in terms of trying to get a better career.

I can't live like this working 40 hours a week at a dead end job with nothing bringing me enjoyment except food. I have no family to help me. I haven't had more than 2 days off a week since I was in high school.

Why is the world punishing me because my parents ignored my health concerns growing up and they were too poor to help me afford college? It seems like everyone else who is as bad off as I am has their family to help support them through their finances and health issues whereas mine just exacerbated mine.

I just can't do it any more. I broke down crying at work last night. I can't even stand working a job where I sit at a desk 8 hours a night and talk to 3 people per shift. I want to end it all so bad but don't know a painless guaranteed way to do it.

There is a possibility that I’m going to graduate late again and I’m getting depressed again over it. I really need a miracle to happen,"I’ve been suffering from bouts of depression since my dad died last year. I was already in the second semester of my master’s when it happened. I finished that semester (with the exception of my research methods course), and then I took a leave of absence. Then in September 2021, I went back to school to work on my placement at a political office until November. From January to March, I worked  there part time until my contract finished, and told them that I would be focusing on my thesis until my school is finished.

My thesis didn’t go as planned, and I can’t help but feel like I’ve let my supervisor down. She is super sweet and although she is very busy, she has been very supportive and knows what happened to my dad. My thesis ended up not having enough interviews, not enough literature, and I’d have to finish it by next week AND find a second reader in order to graduate on time. This was also my fault because I feel like I haven’t been taken my mental health seriously enough, as I have had so many days where I did not want to do anything. I’ve procrastinated so much as a result of fear, depression, grief, and burnout.. etc. I just have not mentioned this to my supervisor because I don’t want to be making excuses.

"Posted This in SuicideWatch, Figured I'd Post it Here. Long story short, I tried to seek help, and it didn't go well.","While I wait for my school counselor to give me an update on the whole online school therapy thing, I was convinced to check out a confidential, free, and text based crisis hotline. It's apparently designed for teens like me who have noone in their life that they could talk to. Now, for me, personally, my experience was subpar.

I don't want to disrespect the volunteer work there, but after the 2 successful attempts, one in the morning and one just 3 hours earlier, I felt like I was just a number on a waiting list. The system constantly kicked me out of the conversation, and the one time I actually had a decent conversation, it felt like they were trying to cast me aside as quick as possible. 

As soon as I mentioned that music helps me organize my thoughts at times, they told me to just listen to music and the conversation closed immediately after. Maybe I'm stupid, or maybe it's just my anxiety and paranoia, but they seemed annoyed. I guess it would help to say what I was expecting.

I was thinking it would be a deep dive into why I feel the way I do, but it was more just a short session of giving me a metaphorical ice pack and sending me home with an old, stale lollipop. If I didn't feel worthless enough already, then well...

As for the 2nd ""successful"" attempt, it was even shorter. They asked me how I was feeling, they asked a question to confirm what I said, I answered, and then the very next message was telling me that I must've stepped away and that the conversation had been closed.

The automated reply also hit me with a stinger saying ""you matter."" It doesn't feel like it. It doesn't help that I had to reply ""STOP"" over and over because I kept getting auto replies from the bot.

Needless to say, I have less faith that online school therapy will even put a dent in how I feel.

I feel like I am living life blindfolded [VENT],"I am 20 years old and genderfluid (they/she/he), and every day I am alive, I have no clue what is going on. My depression is mostly caused by my other disorders (ASD, ADHD, and OCD), and I've had it since junior high. Often, I feel so hopeless because those disorders all have their own comorbidities that mess with me on the day to day. I struggle with writing, spelling, understanding verbal words, social cues, my own emotions, if my thinking or the disorders, and more. There is just so much happening all the time at a nightmare level of complexity. It exhausts me and paints the world dull. I feel like I am always on the verge of imploding and exploding at the same time. People get mad at me for things I didn't know and expect so much from me, when right now this is all I got. My goal is to move far away, onto a hill in the middle of nowhere. It seems like the more the world asks of me, the less I do. Instead of a big moment breakdown, its little ones, like a car sputtering to a stop. 

This all being said, I know that my life will keep moving forward, and things will change. But right now it's just so hard to believe that.  As if the world was against me since day one, ya know.

I’m having literal breakdown because of ikea bags full of clean clothes that I have to sort and put into closets.,"I’m just so tired I can’t do anything. There are 3 bags full of clothes and me took one and a half hour to unpack less than two of them. I also made a mistake of leaving myself with my own thoughts, so I began to spiral, starting with me being angry at my ex and ending on me having flashbacks from primary school (when I probably was also depressed), when I was every day after school sitting at my desk, trying to study or do homework, but I couldn’t even start or focus due to adhd and executive dysfunction. I was every day sitting at my desk after school, guilty over doing nothing and sitting like that until sleep time, only to get yelled at next day for getting another bad grade for not doing homework. 

I just despise almost everything in my life, my parents aren’t supportive at all, except providing therapy and meds (which is a lot, but they’re one of the reasons why my mental health is so bad since I remember). 

I can’t do anything and I’m useless, I might need to repeat my school year, cause I missed a lot of classes due to me literally being unable to get up. I don’t have energy or time for my friends, but I constantly vent to them and I know it’s annoying as heck for them, even though they claim that I can vent as much as I want to cause they do the same, but I just can’t go without telling someone how shitty I feel. And even if they read that stuff, they just respond with one word reply or sad emoji. My ex constantly stresses me out with his weird ass messages and I have to see him at school every day. 

I just feel like everything is just too much and definitely a lot more than I’m able to do. The biggest challenge in my day is waking up and taking any care of myself, but I’m also expected to help out with chores, study a lot for finals, be at every class and to not make everyone uncomfortable with how bad my mental health is. 

So right now I’m sitting and having mental breakdown (for hour and forty minutes already) with three bags of clothes waiting to be sorted, while I have private lessons in 20 minutes and my dad will get angry as fuck at me if I won’t get this done before those lessons. The worse part is just how no one even cares about that, not my friends, not my parents cause in their opinion I’m lazy and probably no one here too. The only person that cares is my therapist, who is paid to care about the fact that I more and more feel like killing myself over the simplest things like chores.",nothinkybrainhurty,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tl7l1g/im_having_literal_breakdown_because_of_ikea_bags/
I just really need to vent,"I'll go back to the beginning. I started dating a girl I feel I really fell in love with. It lasted only 4 months, but I really felt something for her. There were a few times I asked to be intimate with her, with the last time her telling me she thought she was asexual. I was fine with that and was trying my best to adapt. She wasn't a touchy partner but my love language is touch. Whenever she asked to tone it down, I did everything I could to tone it down. Though, in hers and my whole friend group's eyes, I didn't try hard enough.

She broke up with me over text with a long paragraph, not in person because our friend group probably told her I was shaking from anxiety. That morning, I talked to a friend who wasn't in the friend group about what I knew was going to happen. The girlfriend got very upset with me about that but I felt like I couldn't talk to anybody about it without them telling the girlfriend about how scared I was. I admit, talking to someone else instead of her was wrong, but I felt like if I talked to the girlfriend about how scared I was of the break up, it was going to get worse.

She told me I made everyone uncomfortable, that I don't listen or have boundaries. After reading that long break up paragraph, I spiraled. I ran somewhere the group wouldn't find me and I completely broke down. It was so bad that I was taken to the hospital because of my thoughts of self harm and worse.

I lost that friend group, that girlfriend, a lot of people from that place. There's only one person in that friend group that still talks to me and I think she's annoyed with how much I dream about everyone.

No one in the group talks about me anymore. I was easy to get rid of and easy to forget. What sucks more is that this isn't the first time this happened in that group. I always knew that one wrong move and I was next. And then it actually happened.

I haven't been able to keep track of time or my own memory. I haven't been sleeping well (either too little or too much). I've been using pot a lot more than I had before and I'm exhausted all day every day. All I want is to die.",Mission_Cow5108,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkt0z6/i_just_really_need_to_vent/

I need help,"I just got a new girlfriend. We both had sex last weekend and it was great. We’re both 16 and love each other. 

I’ve been pretty depressed during the past year and when i met her, everything changed. I though she would be my new world and she is. But something she told me broke my heart, and made me depressed again. 

One of her Crackhead mom friends had been touching her in the private area when she was younger. She told me this because she got flashbacks from that moment while i were doing the same to her.

She didnt want to hurt me so she did not say anything. This made me furious and sad. I want to kill that motherfucker so badly. And now everytime we have sex she is going to be thinking about that moment.

After this i told my self to never let this happend to her again. Although she will always be hurt it hurts me almost just as much to know this

A post wherein I sort my thoughts,"I'm 30 and I'm alone and it's tough to pretend I'm a whole person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't made a friend since high school. I'm starting to befriend someone at work but it's giving me a lot of anxiety because - when am I going to say The Thing that makes her hate me? It feels like I have to do everything right to be social, or maybe I'm missing something that everyone else has, or maybe I'm just not cut out to be social. But to have friends you have to answer them -when they fucking text- regardless of what's going on in my life, and I just don't have the energy to keep up with that. I recently had someone tell me I was probably not doing well on Bumble BFF because I'm a slow responder. Sometimes I don't know what to say, sometimes words aren't happening in my brain, sometimes I'm just too tired. Maybe missing out on social things for all of my 20's is something I'm never going to be able to recover from. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a lot of workplaces where I was ""the loser."" I had no friends, I'd catch people saying mean things about me, they all get together with each other and I'm not invited. I've been in multiple situations where groups of people don't like me and do shitty, passive-aggressive things to me every chance they get. I don't know what I do wrong. I try to just be a genuine, kind person. I get feedback that I'm nice, I know I'm not perfect but at least I've had some feedback that I'm not totally delusional to think I'm a nice person. But there have also been a few times where I know what I said. There have been a few times when I can pinpoint the off comment that makes someone turn on me, and it must be more than one off comment because it's always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me. It's terrifying to feel like at any moment, I can slip up and someone will just decide I'm not worth their time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I never feel like I say the right thing. Some of my coworker's responses are lackluster (think ""lol"") and I just wonder if she even wants to talk to me? Making friends gives me the same anxiety that trying to date someone gives me. That's kind of fucked up, I should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend. But also it affects me. I feel like I'm not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided I'm not worth their time. And honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment I realize I've internalized all that rejection and got to where I don't feel good enough for friendship. Why would someone pick me when I'm a ball of nerves? Why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feels like half a person? 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've been doing okay relative to the last 10 years. I finally got a job that doesn't feel like Chinese water torture. I'm on medication and that helps a ton. I'm a lot better about not letting myself slip into negative thought patterns. This week I haven't been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because I finally got medication that isn't expired and I'm taking it regularly. But every time I think about social stuff, it just gives me this.... squished feeling? I can't name the feeling but it's visceral, my body feels shitty. I'm going on a vacation with my mom and her work friends in a month and I'm so fucking nervous because what if I do The Thing that makes everyone hate me? I don't even know what the fucking thing is!! But spending four days with people who are talking crap about you in a small space.... I did that around this time last year and it was so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a solution-oriented person and part of my problem is that I don't know how to fix this part of my life. I don't really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship. It took me eight years to figure out the solution to hating myself, and honestly even though it's a struggle it's also worth it to fight through those feelings and find an even timbre. Social situations are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective. I've googled ""How to feel less lonely"" and the fucking answer was Make Friends. How do you make friends when you feel like nobody wants to be your friend (And for good reason!)? Therapists have basically told me to find a group and the friendships will happen naturally, but there's not a huge meet up scene in my area and I have a ton of anxiety about going to one, and the few I have been to were not great. I couldn't read the book on ""How to Influence People and Never Feel Powerless Again,"" I got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss-ass bullshit, but this time I'm not even getting paid for it. That book makes me feel like I have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know. I'm going to keep trying different things. I'm going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing things the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome.

Do particular events cause symptoms or does depression sometimes just happen?,"So my wife has clinical depression. She was diagnosed two years ago and has actively been taking medications. I won’t lie, it gets hard sometimes but I’m trying to understand this more and more so that I can maintain my own stability and mental health while helping her when I can. Anyhow.

So from an outsider’s point of view, sometimes it feels like my wife experienced something or does something and then the depression symptoms happen. Sometimes they boil over and sometimes you goes back into therapy to help. When I ask she says nothing specifically happened she just doesn’t feel good. 

Is this common? Can yo help understand how some of you experience an onset of symptoms?

I let myself too close to the flame,"I can't cope with being alone again. Why am I so envious of my closest friend being happy with others while I am here by myself, heartbroken, and given delusions that I have an actual special relationship with her.

""You told me that I was your closest friend, but why don't you treat me like one? Why do you look happier when you're with others?"" 

""Why do you always make me look like a fool when I show my affection, but appreciate any other person when they show theirs?""

""I've always helped you at you at your lowest. But why did you give up on me at MY lowest?""

There's so much that I want to ask her, but I would look pathetic if I do. 

""You always tell me in person that I am important to you, but why don't you want to spend time with me like the way we used to?""

How can I get used to being alone again? It's like I'm being choked then allowed to breathe for a second just to get choked again right after. My envy won't let me go. I still want her. I am still hoping I could fix this.  I want to be happy too. 

But now, nobody cares. If I show sadness, I'll be seen as weak. Why do others get loved and have dependable people with them? While I, am left alone, trying to find answers from people that are lonely too.

May I ask, how can I depend on solely myself again? I need to learn how. I opened myself too much, and now I feel like a husk with everything taken out from me.

i'm tired of trying but sadly i'm insistent or maybe i never actually tryed something?
im alone since ever, i've never had friends or someone special, never dated, anything. the only relationship that was all the time on my head was the one with myself, or maybe how much this relation was needed. and it feel the same about having a family, i think of leaving them and start living for me and my own and only life for literally the first time... 
im going to a therapist now, it took me long and hurtful years to accomplish this, im really proud of me for taking this step alone and even hyped kinda faithful
but honestly... i'll never recover around my family, and that sucks cause i don't have money yet and not even a job, im not able to work thanks to depression, my family pay my shit and make sure to remember me this every day, that's my biggest shame, but on the inside i know that i can't do that for me now 
but the feeling that i'm a total waste of life will never fade away, cause i never did it. i never lived but i saw too much. i have so many meS on me that i don't know which one is the actual me. i believe i'm still a child, 7 years, when my first trauma happened. there's no memories from moments before or after this age, only from my emotions and fears... and it's scary af cause they're all fears of a little girl. 
it's all the same cold, not sure of anything but know a lot, not alive enough to feel but feeling too much at the same time. and i'm the same girl, alone, scared and sad, willing for help but with no one to ask besides me.
been living through other ages and others versions of myself every one with their personalities and the 7y me me living the alternative stories that in the end is probably another part of another time of my existence...

I need to mention that we weren't technically dating, and I've only been ""together"" with him about a month.

You wanna know the best part?  I was the one who actually hurt him.  I can't even claim to be the victim here.  Every shitty emotion currently pinning me down is 100% deserved.  All because I was having a bad day, and decided to smother my emotions in the company of another dude.

It was only a month, nothing has really changed in my life.  I'm still 19 years old, I'm still going to college, I'm still not attending classes and I'm still just as shitty as I was before.

"Please some advice, I am broken","I am not sure if this is the right place for it but last Friday one of my classmates told me ""jokingly"" to jump out of a window (she has been doing that joke for over a month). I've had it up to here so I said I'd blow my head off. 

On the weekend I tried to hurt myself and went to the emergency room on Monday. They prescribed me some Lexapro and I went home, relieved that I finally got some help. 

Half an hour after I returned home 6 cops stormed my apartment saying they received a hint from the school that I was gonna hurt myself and they searched my whole apartment for a gun (which I don't have so they obv didn't find one) and restrained me. They then took me to the same hospital I was at just half an hour ago and I spoke to the psychiatrist there again, who told the police I am not a threat to myself or someone else. So they let me go again. 

During that they took my phone and it ran out of battery and I didn't have access to it for like 3 hours or more. During that time two of my classmates messaged me asking why I blocked them and they attacked me, not knowing my phone ran out of battery and that's why I didn't answer. They then blocked me and I explained to them on Instagram what happened and they read it but didn't care apparently. 

My classmates apparently told our headmaster they were ""worried"" and then he called the police. I am getting the proper help from all of my teachers and my headmaster and I have an appointment with our schools psychiatrist soon. 

It's just that this whole police incident has left me panicking and crying when I see a police officer/car and everytime someone with heavy boots walks on my apartment floor I sit up thinking the police will come back again. I also can't sleep properly and can't distract myself because I keep having horrible flashbacks of the scene when the police stormed in which leaves me breaking down. It left me broken, traumatized, overwhelmed and desperate because I don't know what to do.

On top of that my classmates all blocked me, are ignoring me and not even looking at me. Talking about being ""worried"" and not even one person asked me if I was alright or how I was doing. 

I am considering going back to the emergency room and talking to the same psychiatrist from before but it's not really an emergency you know? 

Sorry if this text is long, I am just overwhelmed and don't know what to do anymore. All I know is I am traumatized as fuck and broken.

I am alone. In every possible way,"I am 34 years old, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depressive problems since I was 18.

I have no one. I don't have anyone to talk to when I have a problem.

My family, it's not even that they don't want to help me, it's that they don't want to listen to me. They have even blamed me for part of their problems. My father tried to kill himself over 20 years ago when I was little and I have always been afraid that he would do it again. A few years ago, I was very bad, and my father told me that when he saw me like that, he wanted to crash the car into a wall. How could I share my problems in such a situation?

I do not have friends. I may have had at some point years ago, but never particularly close. And the one who was closest to me, when he found out about my problems, he started to distance himself from me, apart from telling many more people what I told him in private.

I have no one to vent to, no family or friends. I left my psychologist to whom I paid 70 euros per session, because she came to call me selfish for being depressed and not being in the same situation as a beggar, a cancer patient, or a person from Ukraine. This last one seemed totally outrageous to me.

Worried wife of a suicide watch.,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to go to but I don't know where else to go. My spouse has struggled with severe depression his whole life. It is genetic, his dad was the same. Any amount of pressure makes him worse. He constantly feels as though life is not worth living and he's a lost cause, he will never feel okay and just wants the pain to go away. We have a baby coming any day now and I was worried that pressure was gonna send him over the edge. We have been talking about having him voluntarily go to a psych ward and see if they can help, kinda as a last ditch effort before I just give him permission to end it.. 

Today he talked to his counselor about going to one in a few weeks after the baby was here, and they came and picked him up an hour later. He is pissed, doesn't Want to be there, which I understand Is normal. He feels completely betrayed by his councellor and never wants to go back. I'm worried that now he is going to pretend like he is fine just to get out. The point of this is to get help why won't he just take it? I'm scared the mental hospital won't help at all. I just need you guys who have been there before to be honest with me. Did it help? What things helped and what made it worse? If it does help or when he comes back home, what are some things I can do to continue the healing process, or just make his life easier? Anything else you feel to share please do.

How to control my trauma (that brings me anger and resentment and pain),"I hold a lot of pain and trauma in me, and I’m not good at sharing it with others except for a very select few (I have started therapy recently).

Sometimes this pain really takes control of me, almost puts me in a black hole where I can’t stop, and it takes a big toll on me and those closest to me mentally. Therefore, I am hurting the people I love most in my life. And the pain only gets worse.

I wish I can stop but I get so deep in this hole for that moment of time and I can’t escape it. When I realize how awful I have been to everyone else, it’s too late, the damage has been done. They understand my trauma and what I been through but people can only handle so much. 

I don’t want to hurt those around me anymore. What are the best tips to stop or just improve over time? Thank you",rieslingmagic,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkmhtb/how_to_control_my_trauma_that_brings_me_anger_and/

My Therapist Dropped Me,"I have been going for 6 months to a new therapist and originally the goal was to just do self care like shower, eat, take my meds stuff like that. I had graduated college and moved to a new city to start my first big boy job and I was struggling with the life transition. Now I have everything together, I take care of myself, i have a stable career, I go out on the weekends, I have a strong healthy relationship but I’m still depressed. 

Every session it seemed like she was seeking goals out of me but I just don’t have any. I have everything but I’m not happy and I can’t come up with anything that would bring me happiness when I have everything I would need.

Last night the topic of session was my connection with people which I had made a goal out of last month but after getting to the end of it I made the statement that I don’t know if I even want to make or strengthen these connections and she got frustrated with me and mentioned taking a break until I had a goal set and that my depression could just be my personality at this point since I have been dealing with it since I was 15 (I’m 23 now).

I’m just upset with myself and I don’t really know what to do. I’ve had 3 therapists in my life and none have really helped, I know I have to do the work but it’s hard for them to guide me when I don’t even know what direction to go in.
I guess I just need to get another or more antidepressants or something, idk.",idrk144,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tksuht/my_therapist_dropped_me/
Struggling to keeping it together,"I'm 28 years old and I've been depressed since sophomore in high school. During those years, I've tried my best to keeping myself together (not showing my true emotions, try to make friends, make people laugh, etc) and of course I still go through battles within myself but I've been the victor so far. Recently, it's been incredibly difficult. I've been contemplating suicide more often than usual. Now, I am not saying that I'm going to go through with it because it would absolutely destroy my family, especially my mom. They love me and I'm lucky to have friends that care about me as well. However, I can't help but notice that my life is a complete and utter joke. I've made no accomplishments, really nothing of value that I've made as a 28 year old person and it's getting to me. I'm not an intelligent person, I have no ambition, I have no drive and I have no goals in life. Compared myself to everyone else, I'm a loser. I'm a loser and I know it for a fact and I feel like my friends and family, even my peers at work, know it as well. I'm a joke.

Now, it has been a struggle to keep my emotions and thoughts under control. People start to notice a change in my demeanor when I talk to them, noticing how I'm not acting as my ""usual"" self. My true emotions is starting to show itself and unending thoughts of suicide has gone rampant. I believe I am losing myself day by day and I'm trying my damnedest to keep up appearances and not letting people worry about me. Of course, I can't afford to go to therapy sessions or get my hands on prescribed medication so I'm only left with limited resources. Hell, I just got denied health insurance without a clue as to why. Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm expecting by posting here.

Major depressive episode hurdles to start feeling better,"Im talking about the kind of depressive episode where you lay in bed all day for days/weeks and struggle to find energy/motivation for simple functioning such as eating and showering. Just lay/sit there having negative thoughts and feeling hopeless, useless and pathetic.
I have these episodes a few or so times a year.

My question is: Do you generally have something in your mind that feels like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode? 

For example sometimes for me i just feel like *if only I could completely clean my house*... I'd start to feel better. 
Other times it might be something else on my to do list or a few things i feel are the obstacles to feeling better..  

the obstacles always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state as if I'd have to put on a ton of body weights and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued. 

Its bizarre because ive noticed over the years that completing whatever it is that I've decided as my *obstacle* is generally the 1st step to leaving my major depressive episode...I can't describe the mental workout it is to get something done sometimes though..like I may attempt to get it done 4 times in a week to just end up giving up and going back to bed.

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets this? And sets up *hurdle type things for themselves* when they are super depressive ???

And do you ever eventually complete your ""obstacle"" &amp; does it help you to coming out of the episode?",JasminJennifer,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkp3cz/major_depressive_episode_hurdles_to_start_feeling/

Lost in college with no motivation,"I’m a college student who has changed their major 5 different times and am currently pre-med although I have always struggled in my science courses. For about the last year I have had zero motivation. My GPA is slowly slipping as I never study or go to class. I used to smoke weed all day (I was high most of 2021) but I quit and now I just go on my phone in my room or watch movies.

I have no friends here and don’t socialize. I usually only leave my room to get food or to study for a test (usually the day before or day of). I get jealous when I see everyone hanging out and enjoying their college experience while I go to the movies alone or find other ways to distract myself.

I keep telling myself I have to change but I never do. I feel like my advisors have given up on me. I don’t even know if I want to be a doctor but it’s a clear cut path that will allow me to help people and provide job security although my real dream is going to Hollywood and trying to make it as a screenwriter.

I have been depressed and have cycled through a lot of medications with my doctor…none of them work. She now thinks I may have ADHD.

I just struggle to think long-term and have been extremely burnt out since senior year of high school. Before then I was always a good student.

I don’t know what happened to me. I often fantasize about suicide or dying and lately have just been wishing to stay in my room and just do drugs all day.

-------------------------------------------
first and foremost, no im not going to kill myself. let's get that out of the way. but i do think im depressed. i was telling myself it was just a life-slump for a long time. then i was telling myself it was just sadness from the slump. now i've literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i gotta talk about it with someone, even if someone is this phone screen. 

-i've always had major self esteem and confidence issues, not really sure what it stems from but i have always felt inferior to those around me. which btw i cannot believe people live life happy with their appearance. that is a blessing that people take for granted. anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and i believe that, over the past few years, a mix of rapid lifestyle changes and stress related events has caused me to have depression.  the part that confuses me is that, while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of things, i don't feel like it's a bad life to live. i have wonderful friends, family, i have a great scholarship to a good school, i do fun things and go to parties and drink. i feel like an average person put in my shoes would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passions at all, which i do not. probably why i fuck everything up all the time. 

-it is common for me to have suicidal thoughts. i really don't know why since, in reality, i wouldn't want to kill myself. i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm. i am self aware of these thoughts and i have attempted breathing and thought altering methods to get rid of them, but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger. it physically hurts. they are not always about suicide, but they are always very negative targeted at myself. i just can't help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nuts to finally end it all. sometimes i can't look at myself in the mirror because i know it'll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me. and as sad as it is to say it i really just do not like myself. i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am. objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy. im 6'2 and im physically fit. but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different. there have been a few instances in recent months of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can't. i literally can't. i don't see it, i don't know where you guys are looking, but i truly don't see what you see.

okay it's not just about my appearance. i find myself annoying and awkward. i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time, usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes. but behind my smile is most commonly a frown. im fucking annoying. my thoughts scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect. i talk too much. sometimes i say things i dont even mean or agree with just to say something. i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot. im volatile and irritable and ugh
  
-i fuck up most things i do, work, school, relationships, you know how it goes, the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal. something about the way i was made is just wrong i guess. that's another one of those negative thoughts that repeats in my head a lot. born wrong. today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself, beating my own face in, felt great honestly wish i could've made it a reality 

-i can't find happiness in any of the things i used to enjoy. ive gradually stopped all my hobbies except for the gym, which is where i take my anger out usually(i have a lot of that). i can't even sit through a movie without thinking ""what is the point of me doing this."" WHAT IS THE POINT?! life feels numb. pointless. i go about my societal life just like everybody else. i study, work, play, sleep(rarely) but it all feels the same. a gray bland mesh of nothing. even something like eating delicious food i just don't get enjoyment anymore. the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone makes a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh, but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh. 

-honest opinion of myself? i fucking suck. im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck. i constantly make poor decisions and can't seem to learn from previous ones. im ugly. the only things im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself. i say dumb shit and get shit on for it. what kind of asshole has the privilege and opportunities that i have and is still sad and lazy like this? im the type of person that was actually just wired wrong in the head, and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can't disgusts me. to be honest i don't even know who i am. a few months ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is. i replied ""nothing. i don't have one."" i really don't have a talent or something im good at, and seeing people around me do amazing things and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurts. 

*** i do not feel like this 24/7. id say about 10% of the time i forget about all my stresses and worries and appearances and fuck ups and im actually HAPPY. then when the happy goes away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all comes flooding back. im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless highs and happinesses that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them.

-the question i find myself asking often is why. why am i doing this. why do i feel this way. why did i say that. why did i do that. why am i a certain way yadda yadda. i am a realist. i also truly believe there is no point to this. life. why do we all live such stressful unrewarding lives, putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever? i read comments on posts like these saying that life is beautiful, meet everyone you can, experience nature, get help, it gets better it CAN get better, but the thing is, no, it can't. everyone's situation is different i guess, but where im at and what im doing, nothings gonna change. im not going anywhere. even if i was it wouldn't matter. societal standings and fancy job positions mean nothing. humans are not made equal. everyone is different, special, in their own way. therefore, some people are biologically and factually better than others. whether it's stronger, larger, smarter, faster, people are different and some traits are preferable. i just happened to get stuck with the traits that make me FUCKING SUCK at life. no amount of meditation or antidepressants (fuck big pharm) is going to change who i am. people don't change. painting a leopard red doesn't remove his spots, it just hides them temporarily

--well it's 4:27 and im going to the gym at 7 and then lecture after that so i guess i should sleep a few hours so my motor functions stay working so i can keep going on in this endless cycle of pointless effort, thanks for hearing my ted talk, wish me luck on my chemistry exam, good night all &lt;3",4blueberrybear,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkrwdn/vent/

not only all this, but recently i’ve been dealing with more health problems. my hearts been racing even when i’m just laying down, and it makes me feel like i can’t get enough breath in. like i’m constantly breathing but not fully or something. 

i also have been having horrible cramp-like pain, and after getting a ultrasound apparently i have a bunch of cysts on my ovaries (but this apparently isn’t the cause of my pain??) and that terrifies me. they think it might be the testosterone and i’m scared i’ll have to stop taking it. and they’re not even sure that’s what’s causing the pain. 

i’ve been trying to cope by hanging out with friends and my boyfriend online and other stuff like that but it can’t distract me enough from the physical issues. so i’ve been using weed and alcohol, but i know i can’t keep using these to cope forever. i know it’s likely i’ll become an alcoholic and part of me doesn’t even care as long as it distracts me from the pain enough. 

i’m trying to apply for government assistance for disability but it’s a lot of work and i feel like it’s pointless and they’ll just reject me again.

Five years later and I'm still here!,"It's been five years and a couple days now since my first major attempt. I'm not too sure how I feel to be honest. Has life improved? Well not really. Of course after that first attempt, I tried a couple more times. I think if we look at the net value, I'm relatively in the same spot as I was five years ago vibing on the bridge. Thankfully, I'm not too upset about that. I think sadness and my inability to get out of said sadness is something that I will have to live with. I'm getting better at fighting it, that's for sure. Are some days tiring and fucking unbearable? Of course. But now I'm just content with existing. Sad days are hard, some days are easy. 

I think I'm just shocked that I'm still alive. Well I definitely know that younger me would be shocked I'm still kicking around. Maybe he'd be happy that I stayed for this long.

lost in this place called earth,"You know that feeling when the days and nights drag on? The tears stream down your cheeks, your vision starts to tunnel. The feeling of being lost with no where to go. The movie staring yourself is playing and all you can do is sit back and watch as the world starts to slip away from you slowly. 

The first time I tried taking my life was 8 years old. I was physically and mentally abused from the moment I was born, and still mentally abused to this day. This time its me abusing myself. I got so used to being alone and not wanted, so what's the point in trying anymore. 

2020 was a bad year for everyone but that is the time where I started losing a grip on my life for the last time. My world started spirlling out of control. What did I do? I woke up at 330am walked into the kitchen grabbed a knife and drug of deep across my throat. I walked into the bedroom where my wife was sleeping. She woke up to the sound of gargling, only you find me trying to hold my throat shut. She immediately called 911 and just looked at me in aw. With a single tear falling down my cheek. All she could do is watch as her husband is slowly dying right in front of her. When I woke up 3 days later in the hospital,. She was no where to be found... This is when my world came crashing down over me, hearing those 4 words whisper out of her mouth "" I want a divorce"". That was the day I died inside. I lost my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, and the mother of my child. 

I lost everything that day, family, friends, my daughter, my house, my truck, and my heart. Every day I fall asleep crying. Begging to take me back in time, but in reality I know I can't. So what is there left to do you ask? Die... 

Life for me has ended, I have nothing more left in me anymore. I have been suffering from depression for a very long time. I'm exhausted, I'm tired, I'm alone, I'm lost. All I want is to end this story of my life called misery. I want to leave this world so I don't have to disappoint anyone ever again. I am broken, I can't do it anymore. Everyone says life is precious. Well to me life is a waste of time. 

I have nothing more to give, I have nothing more to learn, I have nothing. 

I am depressed, I am hurt, I am sitting in the theater watching as my screen starts to fade to black. This is it I tell myself. I am no longer going to sit here and put a fake smile on my face for everyone else. I am done helping out others with there problem. 

Why doesn't anyone ask me how I am doing, probably because I would lie. I am going to die. I am ready. I hope and pray the my daughter and my ex wife can forgive me. I will always love them until the end of time. 

With that being said, I am signing off... I have nothing left in the tank. 

Goodbye cruel cruel world, until we meet again. Daddy will always be looking over you guiding you in a direction I never was pushed towards... 
I may not have any friends, but I will be leaving a mark on legacy. My job here is done.

Good bye ....signing off.",Stallion069,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkrh92/lost_in_this_place_called_earth/

I really need to get my life together,"I am 21 years old, junior in college. I have multiple problems that I need to address. To start, I have gotten carried away with smoking weed. I have been using it almost everyday since I was 18 and I can no longer control it. Im always buying it when I can't always afford it, I spend a good amount of my time at home smoking weed or using THC products. I have also been drinking a lot more than I used to, and I have even picked up a nicotine habit from my friends. I am not doing as well in school as I should be and I really need to be more proactive and motivated, but I feel no motivation some days to even do anything school related. I havent been eating well a lot of days, been eating a lot of fast food and skipping meals some days. 

There are nights where I barely get enough sleep because I end up staying up most of the night being on my phone, watching TV, or playing video games. I have set goals for myself that I want to workout more, build myself up, and eat better but I never stick to them. I feel very anxious and depressed a lot of the time, with the only relief I have felt comes from hanging out and talking with friends. I have some really great friends that I am very close with and a wonderful family that would do anything for me but I can't help but feel alone.  

I feel a great need for companionship and I have been trying to get into a relationship for a long time, going from one person to the next but nothing ever becoming of it and we become strangers again. It has taken away a lot of my energy and exhausted my motivation and drives me further into my loneliness and adds to my anxiety. I have been on an emotional rollercoaster the past several months talking and going out with multiple girls (not at the same time) and it ending the same. I just feel a void in my life some days and lately I have been spending a lot of time around friends to try and fill that void, more than I usually do which could also contribute to me spending less time on school and a lot of other important things. I have barely been home in the past week because I was with friends.

 I feel completely empty and hopeless somedays and feel like my life is over. I see others living their best life, exciting things happening, having opportunities, connection with others is just natural to them, and just having a great time with life and then there's me who wishes I could be that way but I know I am different than them and no one will ever see me like that. I will always be by myself wherever I go, and I used to be such a happy child, excited for life, not afraid to dream big and wonder about the future, and just live in the moment but things happened that turned me into what I am today. I feel like a shell of who I could have been and that my younger self would be dissapointed in me. I wish I could go back to when I was about 5 and not taken it for granted and go through life again with what i know now. 

Some days I really do not like the person I am turning into. I do not thing that I am doing what's best for myself mentally, physically, and emotionally. I feel like I'm on a treadmill, walking through life but not actually getting anywhere while watching everyone else pass me by. I really need to break out of this mindset and change my life around if I am going to survive in this world and live the good and happy life that I always wanted and not a wasted life.",LemonadeMan3,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tk8h3h/i_really_need_to_get_my_life_together/

Living a rollercoaster,"No clue where to put this so it’s going here. 

A while back I was asked “what caused you to start drinking so heavily?” My default respond to that has always been “it’s just how I am”. Which for the most part is correct, deep down I think I always knew the real answer. Now I am finally realizing it’s truth, it’s love. 

A little more context: I have been sober for over 8 years now, and to be honest, recently it has really been tested and I’ve come closer than I ever have to relapsing. It is worth mentioning, I’m not the type of person to actively seek a romantic relationship. I have had a few very brief flings over the years, but nothing I would consider serious, and for the most part I have been okay with it. But now, I have actually caught real feelings for someone, and I am falling hard. So hard it’s really scaring me, it’s causing me to want to hide from the feelings as I used too by drinking. 

After years of counseling I was given better “tools” to help process certain feelings that could lead to me drinking. Which I do believe they have helped me recently because I actually did something I didn’t think I was capable of. I told her how I felt. Too my surprise she actually didn’t tell me no, but, she didn’t exactly say yes either. Which is why I am feeling the way I am now I believe. 

Now I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster of highs and lows. I see her and talk to her daily as we do work together, however some days she seems so distant and shut off, others it seems to me she’s overly flirty. We have gone out once, it didn’t really go as planned but it was still nice. 

Now to the stuff that is really eating at me. She had just gotten out of a relationship a while back. I know it didn’t end well and when I told her how I felt she said she still was trying to get over her ex and she was confused. Which is understandable, and I want to give her time and space but at the same time I don’t want to miss my chance, especially because I have not felt this way about anyone for over 10 years.  To make things worse her ex is also a coworker in our department and I have seen them leaving together after work multiple times a week. Which to be fair is really her business, but if she really would rather be with him, why don’t she tell me. That’s what’s killing me, I feel like she is using me as a fallback or a second choice. I really hope it’s not the case, I do not think I could handle it. I just wish I knew for sure how she felt, I can handle being rejected it the limbo I feel like I’m in I can’t handle. And honestly I don’t know what to do about it. I’m so scared I’m going to slip one day and have a drink, if that happens I know I won’t recover from it and I’ll loose everything I worked so hard to achieve. 

There’s more details if anyone has any questions. If anyone can tell me what I should do please feel free, anything is better than how I feel now.",iceman92066,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkm5kf/living_a_rollercoaster/

I give up. I won't ever get better. My life will be the same for the rest of my life. My youth is already wasted. I'm rotten inside. 

The pills on my desk are a constant reminder, but also a comforting way out anytime I would want to. The light from my window is a reminder of how the world will go on and forget about me.

my entire future rides on whether my boss decides to report a 5 minute mistake,"So I recently was put up for a promotion at work to a position that would allow me to work less hours,less days and make more money while also furthering my future. I have never been happier

Until recently

I'm in the final stages of the process to get hired but I'm still CURRENTLY in my previous position. We have a rule at work, you can be late once per 30 Days, if you go over that you get written up and put on a ""disciplinary level"". Which wouldnt be so terrible if one of the stipulations of being put on a disciplinary level is being unable to transfer positions for a year.

So on sunday morning I wake up and start making breakfast, what i do every morning on my day off, I've been off every other weekend for the past 6 years so I go into autopilot and sit at the table, look at the clock and think ""I'd be at work right now"" so 8am rolls past and while I'm wating I see my phone buzz so I pick it up and look at the screen and see the words that make my heart climb into my throat every time

""Boss: Where are you?? You were scheduled for 8"" 

I scramble upstairs so fast I knocked over the table and chairs and took some picture frames off the walls of the stairs,  but I get to work and think ""it's fine its okay I just cant be late for 30 days,easy enough"" 

3 days later it's an unbelievably slow day, so we all order sushi and I drew the short straw to pick it up. Takes me 25 minutes to get there, pick up the food and start heading back, so I'm at a stop light about 5 minutes from my job when I see a car blast through the light and TBone a truck causing a huge accident and blocking my path back to my job, 

I feel my heart sink and my ears ring, the closest way back is an extra 10 minutes at least, this asshole running a red light may cost me my job,

I'm not proud of it but I sped the entire way there to get back to the hospital, I sprint out of my car(leaving the food) I get inside and dive to the time clock and swipe my card

""Time punched 17:05 LATE"" 

At this point I just stand there for a second, unsure of what to do, do I tell my boss? Do i try to fix it? Do I lie? 
I finally decide to text my boss and explain the whole scenario in detail, expecting to get back a next step, a scolding, reassurance or anything. Instead I get back one word 

""Ok"" 

Ok??? What does that even mean??? I want to press it further but I'm so scared of fucking up even more, I've taken on extra responsibilities this week and picked up 26 hours of overtime over the next 2 weeks as a subtle way of saying ""please dear god dont put me on a level I need this promotion"" 

This all happened 5 days ago and I'm living in panic every one of these days since that I'm going to get the ""Hey can you meet me in my office. Now"" call thatll signal the end of my dream to progress

I'm not sure what to do at this point but I just had to get this out

I've spent the past couple of months dealing w anxiety, depression and depersonalization, and trying/changing medications. I am on a part time work plan where I work remotely in the afternoons.

"help, unable to force myself to go to work","I'm on mobile so please excuse me, I'm also a first-time poster on here.  28 female.

I quit a job I had for 5 years, last year in May of 2021. I was really good at that job, one of the top people even if it was just a warehouse job, I was a trainer I knew how to do everything and a lot was expected of me everyday. My boss was incredibly verbally abusive to everyone, I didn't realize it for a few years but my last two years being there she was talking bad about everybody behind their back and just being a horrible human. I finally quit one day when I got a different job with an old coworker. I was working that job for about 2 months before I started to struggle going. At first it was because I felt inadequate and tired all the time, I have a problem with being new at things. It progressed to a new coworker there was starting to push my boundaries a little bit, older man telling me what to do and making me feel dumb, which I know is my own issue. I realize this whole post is my own issue.. but anyway.

  I ended up leaving that job because every time I was there I was going to the bathroom to cry at least once and I couldn't make myself do it anymore and between that place and the job I'm at now I had three other jobs, one was Amazon delivery, the other was a daycare, and the one before that was just instacart. I couldn't make enough money on instacart to even be a part-time job, it was also putting stress on my car. But I loved being able to work for myself basically and create my own hours. I hated how the kids at daycare were treated and it disgusted me to the point I couldn't work there anymore, and Amazon hours were terrible, and I wasn't getting home until 9:00 p.m. which does not work for my 8-year-old son. 
I finally got this job in January of this year and so far it has been pretty good but I've noticed that I'm struggling to go a full 40 hour pay period, in the past 3 months I've missed seven days which is a lot I suppose. I just wake up in the morning and struggle to go and a voice in my head tells me that I don't need to and everything will be okay even if I decide not to go. As long as the excuse I have is good enough. And then I get so anxious about going back that I decide to stay home the next day and the day after that.
 I'm currently on my third day of being at home and even though I have a good excuse I'm sure they don't believe me a little bit. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been a hard worker and up until my breaking point last year, I didn't know what this was. I still don't know what it is that I'm feeling. I'm not feeling entitlement or anything like that, I just feel empty and numb and what's the point of going? I have to have a verbal argument with myself, let me say that again, with myself. I literally have to talk out loud to myself and argue that I have a house payment, I have bills, I have a kid, who also has bills. What is wrong with me? My family on both sides has history of depression and I have unprofessionally diagnosed adhd, my mom has anxiety disorders.
 Last year when I quit my job I left because of the work environment and how bad it was, and now my new job it's more laid back but it's the same kind of job, nd I'm constantly worried I'm being talked about and that I'm not good enough to be there. My anxiety from the other job is transferring here. For no reason. Everyone is incredibly nice. 
I'm also struggling internally because I really want to go to college and get a better kind of job but I don't know what I want to do yet. I'm feeling overwhelmed by it because I'm a single mom and I don't know how I'm going to be able to go to school and work at the same time. So I guess for the past couple months I've also felt pretty trapped. Feeling like I'll never work for myself and I'll never get a good job because I can't figure my life out.

But has anyone experienced this kind of feeling at my age? I don't know if it's burnout or if it's related to my cptsd that I have from a physically abusive relationship from years ago.

I live for my shitty supermarket job,"Nowadays I find that things simply don't make me very happy, like video games, reading, watching tv. I have felt pretty neutral over the past couple of months but God I feel so stupid saying that the only thing that makes my day feel like it has meaning is my shit supermarket job where I rearrange products and basically ruin the day of whoever works in that aisle.

I just like being told to do something and getting away from my not-so-nice home life. I'm exhausted during every shift and have passed out twice at work before but its the only thing that makes my life feel like it has any point.

And I really try to take care of all of this problems but it's exhausting. And for what? 

To live in a world where everything is getting more and more fucked up every minute. The pandemic, the war, the famine that's probably gonna come soon as a result of the war.(I'm Polish so very much can feel the effects of what's happening in Ukraine) I'm also vegan and knowing that so many animals are still suffering... 

And the prices of everything are going up i don't even think I can afford to live anymore. 

And I'm really trying, going on a walk in the forest everyday, doing yoga, eating healthy, just generally taking care of myself like a normal person would. But I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Hoping someone will read this..,"A little about me first... i have always been the type of person to see things only black and white. I live my life through facts and being direct. Im very detailed and observant. I observe peoples behaviors and see who they really are (are they genuine? Fake?). Im also the type of person who analyzes everything. Could be over thinking. I analyze every conversation, every behavior, every tone, and i start to over think. Does this person hate me? Did i say the wrong thing? I dont think i can change the way i am by not caring because i had a lot of pressure of being perfect or good enough growing up. I define myself as a perfectionist and a people pleaser. I hate who i am and i push so many people away in my life because i dont feel like anyone actually cares about me. I feel alone and im sad. 

I started a program at school that is very competitive to get in. I was hoping to make friends there since we all worked so hard to get in. Its been about a year and i dont see any of them outside of school. No one texts me outside of school. And during school, no one talks about anything OTHER THAN SCHOOL. Its like no one actually cares what i did over the weekend. Or how my life is. I would put myself out there and be interested in others lives and even invite them to do stuff but i always get turned down. Every time i get turned down its just another step deeper into depression.

I need help,"Before I start talking, I want to apologise for my english skills, since it's not my mother tongue. 
I just need to vent somewhere but I am also asking for help, but most importantly, I need someone to listen to me right now. I have no idea on what to do. 

I am a 16 year old student who goes to an art school, staying in a boarding school under the week. I have good parents and I love them and they love me, but have little understanding that depression is actually an illness. Due to my depression, I am very limited in talking about my feelings, since its exhausting and I do not know how to express myself. So when I'm usually confronted my them I say: ""I dont know"" ans they've grown tired of it. 
I have been feeling more depressed but also suicidal, starting to plan my suicide. I wanted to take my life in late april, probably by hanging myself. I dont exaclty want to die, but I just couldnt see any way of me feeling better. But I want to feel better. I dont want to take my own life, I have a lot ahead of me. 
A dear friend of mine and I talked to one of the workers in my boarding school and I told them everything, since I was afraid of taking my own life. But I didnt talk to my parents since on my side, its very difficult. 
To explain this, my mum is one of the few people that got damaged by the covid vaccine. The doctors didnt take her serious and she suffered so much the past few months, breaking down and falling down the stairs one time. My dad is a very busy man and I feel like he is just...I dont know how to explain, but emotionally not there often. I know this is just my point of view and does not reflect reality, but I basically feel like this towards my parents. 
The worker in my boarding school made up 3 options: 1. Stay in boarding school and looking for a therapist tomorrow 2. Calling my parents to take me home and 3. To go to the mental hospital immediately. 
I just didnt know what to do. So the worker had to call my parents. They chose to take me home. 
Even tho the worker said that my father sounded on the phone like he was understanding, the reality looked different. My parents where of course overwhelmed and angry, I tried my best explaining everything. For example, my mother said i didnt even try to get a new therapist, but I did my best. 
When we got home, it got worse. 
My father asked stuff like how I wanted to take my own life, I didnt want to tell him. Later, my mum came downstairs and we all talked. Well, not really. 
They were overwhelmed and seemed angry, tho they said they werent. My parents screamed at me saying I didnt try to reach out to them, questioning why I didnt talk to them. But they said that they cant tell me reality or else I'd start panicking an crying, they told me that I cant accept the truth and I'm panicking because of this, that I'm acting up cause I was crying like a madman. I felt like my world was shattering. They screamed at me, that I wasnt trying my best and that I didnt even try. 
I tried to explain to them that I was scared to tell them and stuff. I tried my best, but I dont think they really understood. They want me to go a mental hospital but I know this would make things worse for me. I neez my friends in boarding school, but I know that this cant keep going on. I know that school itself makes me feel bad, but I have all my friends there that help me so much. 
But they said that it's too late for me and I should have made the decision earlier. 
I'm just totally...I dont know. 
I cant stop crying. I was speechless to how they screamed at me, breaking down in front of them. And I dont know what to do or how I should handle the situation. 
We wanted to go to my old therapist (who isnt really good) but we cant reach him. I don't know what to do. I am home right now, but I wanna go back to my friends. I really need them right now. But if course i cant. 
My mum is still saying how she cant keep up with me and shes overwhelmed with me. 

Can someone help me please? Or at least can I have some comforting words?

Understanding and Helping new Girlfriend with Depression,"First off I have very little experience in dealing with anyone with Depression I freely admit that.

Over the past couple of months I have been Chatting with and Hanging out with this amazing woman I met on a Dating app.

She has Severe Anxiety, PPD (Postnatal Depression), Suicidal Thoughts etc 

We'd hit things off pretty well just from chatting over the app from what I thought. There were a couple of times where she'd wanted to end her life so she tells me but she managed to get past that.

The first time I met her in Person was amazing I had never ever felt so at ease taking with a woman before it went really well. At that point I knew this chick was worth the time we just clicked that well instantly. 

Since then we've done a couple of day trips places and that went very well, also one of those times was with her young child. (less then 1yo) she doesn't have a lot of time for herself and finds it hard to get a decent nights sleep partly to do with the young one waking in the middle of the night. 

Lately she's had a couple of  very low moments, her home life isn't the best. (Still living at home because finically she cannot afford to leave) she gets Abuse from her mother constantly and also seems to live in fear especially when her child is being loud it could wake her Mother.

As of last week she admitted that she really liked me I have been clear all along that I really like her! just so she's not thinking that she's in limbo.

I live over an hour away from her but I do travel up to her home town for work at least twice a week sometimes less sometimes more. 

There's some weird thing where she doesn't want her mum knowing about me. So consequently I cant see her that much unless mum is not home which really sucks. 

I find it hard to deal with when it feels like she's giving me the cold shoulder. I know it's the depression that's doing it not her true feelings. One of her Red Flags about dating me is that I don't know/understand her mental health. However the way I see it is if you don't tell me then I can't understand but apparently that was not the way to approach that one...

I'd love for nothing more then to give her a big hug that in the hopes that it might make her feel a little better about things but unfortunately I don't get the opportunity. She knows that I will come up any time I don't mind driving at all so I don't let that be a barrier plus I can afford to do so.

I'm scared to loose her because I really want her and I to work. 

At times I want to just say stuff it and walk away but I know that's not what I want.

I used to be happy... not sure how to get back there,"I think the pandemic hit me hard. I moved out of my childhood home of 30 years, 6 weeks before the pandemic hit. I had worked 2 jobs and saved for 4 years for a deposit on a place of my own, which, in the very expensive city I live in, was 50kms away from my family.  It felt like such an amazing achievement at the time.

But ever since then, mentally I've never been the same. I am so lonely yet I enjoy living alone.I am a highly anxious person. I always was but now I just worry all the time. I move about life with a permanent storm cloud over my head. I struggle to regulate my emotions. I am getting more and more overweight and cannot seem to stop eating bad food. I quit my job in 2021 and got a new one, but I have never quite been happy or settled there.

I have tried mindfulness, regular exercise, breathing techniques. Everything you can think of. I went to the doctor for help with regulating my low moods and she put me on the pill which has made things even worse. I am feeling things lower than ever before. I had a really bad day at work today, and for the first time ever, I  thought (not in any way seriously or actionable, but the thought popped into my mind) how suicide would be an option to not have to deal with things.

Everyone around me seems to be so busy with husbands, wives, kids, activities etc. I seem to be getting left behind.

How do I forgive myself and stop hating myself,"This is a really long rant, but I just needed to get it out. I feel like I'm starting to become a better version of myself, one that people like/respect and want to be around. And I just can't stop beating myself up for not being this version in college. When I was nearly suicidal and I lost some friends who kept abandoning me and affirming the horrible thoughts I was already having.

Last year, one of my roommates lowkey bullied me and I started to believe I was a terrible person and was overthinking everything I ever said wrong, especially when a couple other friends abandoned me at the same time over something they were upset I said (which I think could have been resolved with communication but they didn't try). But I talked to my other former roommate recently and she said that I was fine, that I didn't deserve any of it and she didn't know what I was going through at the time. As she said, ""don't just turn the page, close the fucking book."" And I started to feel like I was getting closure about stuff.

So I thought I would text one of the other people who sort of ""broke up"" with me. It's been a year, I just apologized for how shit went down in the friend group without blaming her or anyone else and really poured my heart out about how dark my mental health was at the time. And I said she could apologize to the other girls (who I believe blocked me) if she wanted. I know it was a little selfish to unload like that, but I made sure to say that I didn't expect anything of her and she didn't need to respond. And she didn't reply. But she did like my instagram post today.

I know they don't owe me anything and I swear I'm not mad, but I think part of me was still holding on hope to some form of closure. Part of me hoped that they still cared, that maybe they would care a little if they knew how dark it was for me at the time. I know that's selfish, but damn the last few times we hung out were just me doing her favors and giving her rides before she ""broke up"" with me as a friend, so to speak. But no one cared. As soon as I wasn't a ""fun friend"", they bounced at the first sign of conflict/mental illness. 

And again, I'm not mad, I'm not gonna harass anyone with texts/expectations. But it really fucking sucks to feel like I've been going through this horrific and terrifying period just to discover that no one cared.

Depressed and Suicidal. How do I get help?,"Title says it all really.

Bit of context: I've been depressed for the better part of 3 years. It started late into high school. I've been referred to multiple mental health services, none of which have helped. I was first referred to CAHMS when I was 16-17. I stopped going to these sessions due to me not being able to open up.

I was then referred to SAMH about a year later. This was also no help.

Finally, I was referred to the Community Mental Health Team Lanarkshire. These sessions were in person where I spoke to a ""qualified"" mental health nurse. I honestly have no fucking clue how this guy got his job. He was totally unprofessional, had this patronising attitude the entire time, was rude and condescending at points and even laughed at me when I said I felt mediocre. The one silver lining here was that he had the ability to refer me onto a psychotherapist, which he said that I was on a 6 month waiting list for. I didn't continue going to these sessions, however I assumed I'd still be on the waiting list. I remember my final session with him, I told him I was suicidal again.

Cut to about 3 months later, I phone them back up to check the progress on the waiting list and when I'd be seeing a psychotherapist. I was told by a receptionist that I'm not on any waiting list. This was very distressing to me because it felt like I had been waiting all this time for nothing. It turns out that they discharged me because I didn't continue going to the sessions.

I'm at my wits end here. I keep trying to get help but the NHS is just straight up incompetent. I wrote a letter to my GP explaining the situation and I got a phone call basically telling me there's nothing they can do and that I have to phone the Community Mental Health Team to see if I can get back on the waiting list.

I'm so annoyed. All this time spent waiting to finally get some proper help, and this happens? I don't know what to do. Please, if there's anyone out there who's been through a similar experience, tell me what to do.",Internal_Bus_3493,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkpjv4/depressed_and_suicidal_how_do_i_get_help/

When does it get easier?,"It’s so strange waking up everyday with this sense that you want things to “go back to the way they were.” Like your brain has its own lil Trumpster lying to you telling you your childhood was better before, or you were happy before you started this job, etc.. 

The truth is it’s always sucked though lol. There are brief moments now where you feel like things are okay, but it’s more of a lack of feeling. 

I’ve always thought I was broken because this has been my constant state since I was so small. I thought I’d grow out of it… or I wouldn’t, but life only continues to throw “curveballs.” 

To others, I seem high functioning, though kind of emotional. 

But I can’t get myself to focus on anything. I can’t wake up on time for work. I work in insurance sales, so I hate what I do. I have to pretend to care about people and their problems, but it just hurts so bad all of the time.

I know my boyfriend doesn’t understand. He’s in medical school and has his own struggles, but I know he feels love. He tells me he does. I don’t, and even if I do see briefly in his eyes that he does care for me, I quickly forget. 

Depression has made me into a terrible person. I should be so lucky to have someone who loves me so much, to have “my looks,” my wit, and the opportunities I’ve been afforded; but I can’t help but feel so completely destitute. He has helped me find some confidence in myself with pursing going back to school, but I’m just so tired of it. The sales calls, the applications, car issues, bills, health stuff, and every other fucking thing. 

When will I be able to do the things I need to do? Like eat 3 meals a day? Have the energy to learn new things? Exercise?

My depression has turned into full rage and anger,"I’m a 21 yr old female and I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 when I was 18. Almost been a month but I’ve noticed that my anger has totally converted into full rage when I was just depressed a month before. 

It’s been 12 years since my dads death but it isn’t a normal death. He was murdered in cold blood because he was running for politics. 

I have been trying to seek help from therapists but it isn’t enough for me to let go and move on. My older brother and boyfriend have been trying to convince me to move on, but it’s not easy. I don’t think I can.

I’ve been feeling very vengeful, more than before about this situation. But every time I let out my anger, I go full rage, and when that episode is over, I can’t help but feel hopeless and fucking worthless. I cry my heart out. But then I’m filled with anger and rage again.


Even conversations with my boyfriend would make me snap, but instead of taking it out on him, I simply tell him I need to call him back then I self destruct. Sometimes I feel like he doesn’t really care since he sends me one worded texts but it’s whatever, it isn’t his problem.

Understanding my depression,"I come from a pretty african evangelical household where mental health wasn’t talked about or addressed growing up. 

In the last few years, i’ve noticed intense waves of sadness and internal pain turn from short stints of time to practically everyday now. There will be time periods of elation, but for the most part my disposition has remained sad.

on an almost daily basis i feel anger/irritability, deep sadness about the way things haven’t worked out for me in the past or currently, or intense rejection from others who may not  intend their actions to be rejection. 

for example, the housemates i live with are a married couple who i was in their wedding, so we’re all friends. when i first moved in, they would always have dinner with me, asking me what i wanted to eat for dinner. but that has tapered off and tonight i walked in from work late and saw they had dinner together and were enjoying tv. it broke me and i went to my room feeling intense inner pain.

2. Never had a night out or went to the mall with friends or classmates
3. Never went to disneyland when i was a kid
4. Never went on a mall shopping spree
5. I've only ever been too the mall twice in my whole life. And I didn't even see all of the mall
6. Never went to dave and busters
7. Never went to an aquarium
8. Never had a female friend
9. Never even had a casual conversation with a girl
10. No gifts for christmas
11. No gifts for my birthday
12. No friends, no one to talk to.

And a million more things that are normal for childhood, I didn't experience that. My childhood, i dont even want to start on that. I used to live in poverty in a 1 room tiny house with a cracked wall, and insects because my dad left us. My dad left the house when i was some months old, and he took the car and drove sluts in it. Regardless i wanted to speak to him. I still visited him and forgave him. But then he asked if i wanted to live with him in a bigger, nicer country with more opportunities. I said yes.  I experienced true mental torment in that house and the worst part is, i didnt even know, i thought my parents were the victims because they brainwashed me so much about some things that i still sometimes struggle if i should believe them or not. In that house i was brainwashed to the point where i couldnt even think for myself, i couldnt tell what was true, i couldnt think anything for myself. I experienced some not good things. They said i can visit my mom in her country, and they pick me up in 4 days to go back to the airport. Waited 4 days. Waited a whole week. They never came. They left me and abandoned me and just left me in some other country, and fyi, that country is one of the poorest ones in my area. The house im at now with my mom, my sister, grandma and 2 uncles isnt perfect. In fact, sometimes i feel like im losing my mind there. They're pretty creepy sometimes...(except for one of my uncles in the house). They dont have any malicious intent or anything, but i just dont want to get into it right now. Im a few pounds overweight and almost got an eating disorder. Its not even my fault that im fat. My mom said its because i took a medicine when i was little and it had a side effect of weight gain. I literally eat 10x less than a normal person. I dont even eat breakfast like 99% of the time on school days. I used to get bullied shitless for my weight. No social life, no friends. Thats another depression aswell. 1 more ticked off the board... no big deal. My life so far has been full of depressing things so something like this doesnt seem that big anymore.

This is only 50% of my life's shitness. If i went into everything then id prob have to spend like 1 and a half hours typing.  My life has just been an absolute mess, and what you saw my post is just a fraction of my life so far. 1 persons trauma is just a small fraction of mine. Those people who has a 'dark phase' probably had a good phase. They had a normal life and they at least had a period in their life where they were happy. I just want to enjoy my life... is that too much to ask???

I feel so jealous of those people who can live a normal life, in a normal nice house with 2 stories, with friends, with people to talk to. My life has just been bullshit after bullshit.",3sperr,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tk12jx/i_just_want_to_have_a_normal_life_i_feel_so_angry/

living is hard,"i can’t remember a time when i wasn’t struggling…i’ve wanted to die for as long as i can remember and i’m worried i’m no longer afraid of death. i just don’t understand myself. i can get up every day and do everything i need to, put my retainers in and wash my face before i sleep, get great grades but no one knows how much my body aches and how hard i have to push myself to do all those things. i joke around my friends and plaster this fake ass smile on my face around everybody but i contemplate my death every night. every. single. night. and i can never sleep before 4am anymore yet i wake up bright and early as if i didn’t almost kill myself the night before. there was a point in my life where i didn’t get out of bed for months, didn’t brush my teeth for weeks, failed every class, never spoke to anyone and got sickly skinny from loss of appetite. it was so awful and i never want to return to that state again that i let myself fall apart now trying to keep my composure. and no one knows. there’s not a single soul in my life who’s aware though i try to talk about it without dragging everyone down with me. 

i’ve also caught myself dissociating a lot more these days, can’t remember shit, can’t feel excitement at all or any other emotion other than despair and exhaustion. and the terrible brain fog. i just don’t know what to do anymore, don’t know how much longer i can keep my act up, i’m repulsed by the idea that i’d have to do this forever. don’t want to talk to anyone about it either in fear that i’d just be a burden. friends and family call me over dramatic and don’t even take it seriously because they’re never there to see how bad it is and idk how to show them. don’t even know what the point of me posting this is. i doubt anyone would even see this or waste precious time reading through this long ass post.",ouinee101,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkp9pb/living_is_hard/

Someone was posting my nude photos online without my consent and I have been struggling really hard since," In 2018, I found out a former ""friend"" and person I used to have sex with in 2016 was posting my naked photos to a nude sharing reddit page/kik and trading them with strangers on the internet. We lived in two different countries when I discovered this and the only thing I could do was call/email with the police in his area and inform his girlfriend at the time. The police didn't really do much, but they were able to track him down and tell him (by phone or in person, not really sure) that he should delete the images he has of me. That was all that came of it, the police couldn't really even ensure he had deleted them. His girlfriend broke up with him. I did speak to him and he sounded sorry to have been caught, he didn't seem to feel bad at all for how he made me feel. Ever since I have been struggling with this. I feel extremely violated and stupid, especially since he could still have the photos and be trading them with other people.

I was only 20 and he was 35 when we were sharing nudes and having sex, and I feel like I did something that could potentially follow me forever. I was struggling hard with mental illness at the time. I also had very little sleep and a stressful schedule, I feel like I went into some depressive spiral and I started doing dangerous and promiscuous things, including being with him. I know it's not an excuse however.

Most days I just try not to think about what happened, but some days, it comes so strong and I get an intense urge to do something bad to myself. I am currently married to the love of my life and he was an amazing support when I discovered my images online in 2018. I know doing something bad to myself would absolutely crush him, but I feel so worthless sometimes. I still feel so violated. I have the guy blocked on facebook, but I know who his current partner is and I occasionally type in the usernames he used to share images to make sure there havent been any posts since then. He still seems to have a kik username active under the same name, but I have no idea if he is still using it. The police told me it would be hard to prosecute for something like this, so telling me that I should try to get legal help is useless. I obviously can't tell most people about this, only my husband knows, so thank you for listening. It's been years now since this all happened and I still occasionally feel extremely suicidal over it, I don't know what to do to stop this. I struggle with depression and anxiety on top of this, but I usually don't feel suicidal unless this comes up.

Failed Therapy,Has anyone had trouble with making progress in therapy? I’ve tried therapy a fair bit throughout my life and I’ve never really gotten anywhere. This year has been exceptionally hard for me and so I have thrown myself into therapy and put a ton of effort both into finding therapists who were a good fit as well as really trying to put effort into it. Unfortunately I seem to be a failure at it. I’ve had four therapists tell me after a few months of seeing me that they didn’t think they were making any progress and although they all offered to keep seeing me if I wanted they didn’t want me to waste my money. I feel like a complete failure and lost cause. I honestly don’t know what it is that I’m doing wrong.,rawnifty,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkdr0u/failed_therapy/
Everyday it gets worse,"**Why am I like this?**

Sometimes I think about what people reactions would be if they found out I committed suicide. Sometimes I think it's the only way for people to understand and feel the pain I am feeling. I know deep down I won't do it , Cowardice and my mom still being alive is the only thing stopping me 

I travel to and from work and I would always cry on the way. I feel depressed , I know I am depressed but if you would ask me why  I wouldn't know where to start or what to say. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm depressed , I just am. Things are seemingly going well and nothing bad has happened yet why am I breaking down all the time and lashing out at others , why do i feel this familar  feeling in my chest , like I'm holding something back. Like I'm on the verge of a break down?

I'm not sure when it started but I'm so scared of people. I know my brain is telling me not to trust anyone or get close to anyone because I'll get hurt but I do it anyway. I choose to believe that this time it would be different. Now Im alone and I have nobody because I've tried to protect myself from others . Look at me now , trying to seek comfort from strangers . I feel so pathetic and useless. 

I want to be happy , I want to not care about what others think of me , I want to stop comparing myself to others and getting jealous of people my age who are more accomplished than me . I want to be happy with who I am. I want to love myself . Every year I would write in my journal my goal for the year and that would be at the top of my list. 

Do you know how tiring it i to pretend to be strong all the time ? Its my own fault. I did this. I put my guard up and pretended to be knowledgeable as if i didn't suffer from anything . Imagine , I'm the one people go to for advice. If only they knew how weak I really am . How stupid I am. I'm so tired of reading body langauage , facial expressions and voice tones and trying to decipher words to see if it has hidden meanings just to see if they are genuine . Living in fear of people and what they think of me. Absoutely breaking down at any mention of someone not liking me or liking something about me or what I did. 

Being cold and keeping people at arms length. Searching online ""meet people online"" and ""how to make friends online"" I'm 22 years old I've been typing it in for years , it dosen't work

I'm so lonely. I have ""friends"" but none of them know who i really am. I put up a front for years , now no one knows how to approach me or what to say to me if they see me . I don't reply to text messages because to me it's a waste of time because they aren't my real friends . If I don't keep them around then I'm truly a loner . 

I go out of my way to be there for them but nobody asks me if I'm okay . Nobody asks anything about me , everyone assumes I'm okay . I feel so unfulfilled. I'm unhappy with my current academia but I'm procrastinating and making it worse. I feel no motivation to study all I'm doing is destroying my life. What do I do? I cant trust anyone .

Am I a coward for not standing up against my abusive parents when I'm 18? Depression is eating me alive.," 

TL;DR: Have been abused mentally and physically by both parents throughout my childhood and even now at 18 years old. Very depressed and have suicidal thoughts, failing school and have poor social life. Afraid to fight back because it will end up in conflict, someone getting hurt, and me getting kicked out of the house for the millionth time. I still care about my parents for some reason and love them, I dont know why and am hesitant to go to authorities. I have nobody to move in with, not much money, no car. What do I do? Am I a coward?

I am currently in my second semester of community college. I have lived through physical and verbal abuse throughout my entire childhood (Asian family). Beaten the crap out of every other day by drunk father, my mother is mentally unstable and controlling and also hits and insults me. Don't want to get into specifics because it would be lengthy and theres too much, but lets just say the worst thing my father has done to me was crack my head against a table and I had to go to the ER to get staples, lied and said I knocked my head into the table by accident. My mother burned me with a hair iron when I was around ten and she says stuff like I am worthless, should have never been born, etc daily. I am not a bad son, very respectful my parents just have a lot of issues that stems from being abused from their parents too and are very controlling. For much of my life I thought this treatment was normal. For example, my mother would start hitting me if I didn't address her as ""Mom"" when talking to her when she felt moody. Stuff like that, not warranted. Last semester I took difficult STEM classes to be an engineer and on the morning of my calculus final my drunk father punched me in the mouth and I bled because I did not wake my brother up for school when he overslept. I failed the final. After that I told them I wanted to join the Marines because I was sick of home, they apologized and promised to change. They still talk shit to me but haven't hit me until last week. My mother socked me in the back of the head for leaving the lights on in the staircase of the house. I felt betrayed, since this is the first time they hit me in three months and I thought they really did change. I screamed ""DONT TOUCH ME"" and glared at her fists clenched and got wrestled to the floor and swung at by my father, then kicked out of the house. Only allowed back in the house yesterday after sleeping on a park bench the whole weekend and eating fast food. (they called me and told me to come home) They apologized but I know they didn't mean it just like every other time.

I am hesitant to fight back against my parents because apart of me still loves them and who they are when they aren't angry. I also know if I yell back or hit back (never hit them before) I would get kicked out of the house so I just take it. I want to separate from them, but I have nobody I could move in with and My depression affected my social life throughout my childhood, with few friends that are all dorming at uni across state. Other extended family believe I'm a bad kid because my parents twist the stories around and make it look like I'm the bad guy, not close with any of them. I have no car, all the money I got from financial aid and scholarships my parents made me pay off their property tax. The only thing I look forward to in life anymore is when I talk to a girl I like in one of my classes, never told her about my situation. Everyone I have opened up to this about tell me that I'm being a pussy and should fight back, but that would get me nowhere but back on the street or possibly hurt and injured, and I don't want to hurt my parents. What do I do? Am I a coward? I just feel like life is not worth living anymore, and I have lost all interest in school and my career.",centeraw,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkiolg/am_i_a_coward_for_not_standing_up_against_my/

PPD &amp; Work?,"PPD &amp; Work?

Hi everyone… I’m 6 months postpartum and for the past couple of months I’ve been calling into work… A LOT. I’ve had depression/anxiety for years but during my pregnancy it got wayyyy worse. Anyways, I’m grateful that my job hasn’t said anything since I always have a sub (I work at a high school as a paraprofessional) but I just can’t come around to wanting to be at work anymore. I don’t want to work. I don’t want anyone watching my baby. I just want to be home with my baby. I haven’t been to work all week and want to call in tomorrow. I cry at night with the thought of going into work. I’m trying to push to the end of the year so I can get paid thru summer then quit in the fall, but I don’t think I can even last these next 2 months without missing so much work. 

Any advice? What should I do? My boyfriend tells me to push thru until the summer at least when we’ll move into a cheaper home situation and he can be the sole provider, but I’m also about to get my income tax and I know that can compensate for my working wages until then. I’m just so lost. Idk what to do.

Emotional pressure leads me to unhealthy behavior,"Hi together, 

I'm working up a lot with myself lately, as it's difficult to get help in my country (in Europe) right now. Long waiting times and little chance to get good therapy. I was diagnosed with a mild depressive episode a few years ago, however I have not been well for several years. Therefore I think that this is not the whole truth

# Stress feeling

I have noticed that a lot of my behaviors can be traced back to feeling stressed.

This feeling of stress is, in my opinion, triggered by a high internal ""pressure"". This arises, for example, from the fear of being abandoned or not doing something right for someone, which could also lead to interpersonal punishments. Unfortunately, I learned in my childhood that if I criticize my mother or say something wrong, I am quickly punished psychologically. She would get loud, not talk to me for a while....

The stress also comes from the outside of course. Time pressure, self-made time pressure, fear of failure.... I am doing my PhD and have been moving up quite fast in management consultancies. The last two years have been a sprint and it has left its mark.

# Behavior

Back to that stress feeling. It takes on different dimensions:

* I unconsciously ""hurt"" myself by delicately biting my arm or scratching my nail bed. Often I just see the marks afters and think ""Oh I did it again"". I can reproduce it e.g. by playing a difficult game (e.g. Dark Souls). As soon as I die against a boss fight, I unconsciously bite my arm in the loading time.
* I get an extreme craving for sex/masturbation (multiple times a day) and would describe it as Compulsive Sexual Behavior. The orgasm is then no fun and I feel exhausted and bad afterwards. Still, I do it.
* I behave in a clingy way and thus ruin relationships because I ask several times in a short time if everything is okay or write messages to get confirmation e.g. that I miss my partner.
* I am completely exhausted after a few days, but cannot sleep",g0bit0dic,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkocl2/emotional_pressure_leads_me_to_unhealthy_behavior/
"I used thinking about suicide as a way to make my problems feel inconsequential. I'm on meds now, and now longer think about it. But the problem that caused those thoughts is there still.","I started taking depression meds a few months ago, and it make my suicidal thoughts go away. It was somewhat amazing, i had such thoughts every day and now I barely think about it at all. Even when the stray suicidal thought pops up, it feels different, less scary.

My problem is that such thoughts would help me through the day, ironiclly. If I was getting stressed I wohld think about the end of all my problems. I even began to mutter 'I'm gonna kill myself' unddr my breathe and mask during work. This was insanely unhealthy, and where I am now is much better comparatively. But the thing that worsened these thoughts is still there.

I hate my job, I have no friends, I don't know how to open up to people, and I'm terrified about having to choose what my life will be. I want to go to college, study sociology, maybe creative writing as well, but when I go to take any sort of action, I'm terrified. It's illogical, I hate it.

I work at an Amazon facility, I stow packages, I pick up boxes, and I push carts. I've working there part-time for 3 years. It was, to me at least, pathetic. So i moved to a longer shift, a small bit of action, I hate working there, but I'm terrified of trying anything else. My new shift is 10 and a half hours long, with a 30 minute unpaid break, and two 15 minute paid breaks. Yesterday was my first day. After 3 hours I went to cry in the bathroom.

I drove to work 40 minutes ago, and soon began crying. It was ugly crying, I was shivering and whimpering, on my drive to work.I didn't use to do this, when I was depressed I was much more apathetic. I had my coping mechanism, but now I don't.

I'm not saying that being depressed was better, I hated my suicidal thoughts, they would ruin my days. But I'm now noticing that they did help me get through some rough moments. It's just not something I expected. 

I know that I should speak to a psychiatrist, maybe a therapist as well. I know that quitting my job would be better for my mental health, I am lucky in that I have the ability to do so and still have somewhere to sleep and eat. I know that I think about my future, if not college with a sociogy degree, then an electrition. There are other options for me, I'm just scared and anxious.

The reason I wrote this here was to make it all feel real. Ir's easy for me to move on from these moments. But I should realise that the fear and anxiety from change can't be worse than the anxiety, and especially the self-hatred, that I feel now.

Sitting in my work parking lot, writing this out, and I took the day off. I'm scared to confront my Mom when I get home, but it's for the best, and It's what I should do.

How do i (19f) tell my mum im dropping out of first year uni because of my mental health and want to repeat first year next september?,"ive been struggling with my mental health for a really long time, even throughout secondary school. the only thing is ive always pushed it down and gotten away with achieving my academic expectations despite how im struggling, ive never told anyone about my problems - not even my mum. i guess i never wanted to worry her and also took alot of pride in being able to “handle myself” and not needing help from anyone. 

i guess the combination of leaving it untreated and uni stress has made it get worse and worse to the point its spiralled out of control. i dont know the last time i actually ate a meal rather than just snack food all day, the light is broken in my bathroom and i cant call maintenance to fix it because of the state of my dorm, i have a nocturnal sleeping schedule and i rarely shower or leave my room. 

i cant apply for special circumstances and try to finish the year because i cant even get out of bed let alone catch up on loads of work and missed assignments. i really just need to go home and eliminate the stress in order to seek medical treatment and get better but i dont know how to break it to my mum because she thinks im perfectly fine. like how does it go from being completely okay to me being in a full blown crisis just like that for her? its not that i dont think she’ll understand but i feel like im a completely different person than who she sees. 

no idea of anyone will see this but id really appreciate some advice/support because ive never spoken to anyone about my mental health and idk what to do",fxirywings,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tko3am/how_do_i_19f_tell_my_mum_im_dropping_out_of_first/

Depression Fuxking Sucks (20),"Depression makes no sense sometimes. I have a great life: Family members who love me, friends who care about me, everything going for me in terms of college, relationships, life, etc., and despite all of these things, I still find myself thinking about ending my life. Suicidal ideation is something that I have dealt with since I was a young teenager, but lately it has become a half dozen to a dozen thoughts of taking my own life every day. What I really don't understand is the fact that almost everyone else around me doesn't feel the same way I do, doesn't see the world in the same way I do. Sometimes when I wake up, I'll just have my mind scream at me that no one and nothing matters, that despite what we do all of us will end up dying one day, etc. Sometimes I just really don't see the point of life. All of us are on a journey with the only things promised to us are sorrow or death. We are taught that we have to make our own happiness and value out of life. But if that's true than there is definitely something wrong with me that can't be fixed; Because some of us just aren't made for your fairy dust fucking world, and anyone who isn't thank you cause there are too many stupid ass happy people in this fuckface of a wordl we live in",Rough_Masterpiece_34,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tknwdx/depression_fuxking_sucks_20/

im falling my family,"It’s been a while since I’ve had depression episodes and I think it has come back, but worse. I’m the first daughter of immigrant parents, therefore I have to be perfect and be an example for my little sister. I’m falling a class in college and can’t seem to get my grade up, I can’t focus, I can’t concentrate, I stay up until 5am doing homework and studying but even though I try my best I feel like I’m not progressing. 

I don’t want my parents to think I’m a failure, I want to make them proud but I can’t find the inspiration to keep going. I feel like sh*t, anxiety haunts me everyday and I just want this to stop. I want to talk about how I feel with my mom but I don’t want her to have a bad image of me in her head, she knows I have depression and anxiety since I was diagnosed but I told her months ago that I was okay, I’m not now. 

I know that if I tell her that i feel depressed again she’s just going to tell me to keep going, my mom is not a bad mom, I love her, she has done everything for me but she doesn’t show us affection. It might been the way she was raised, but I need to her her say that she’s here for me or that she loves me. I can’t remember when was the last time she hugged me or said “I love you” I don’t feel appreciated in this house. When I try to be friendly or make a conversation with her it always ends up with her being mad, I’ve gone several times to her room just to hang out with her but it seems that bothers her, when I try and hug her she tells me to stop. I know she’ll be very disappointed in me if she discovers I’m not doing well in my class. 

She has criticized me because of what shows I watch, if I’m enjoying a video game too much she’ll tell me “that’s all you know how to do, why don’t you do something else instead of playing your little game”, she hates the music I enjoy listening, all I want is to have a mom-daughter moment but it doesn’t happen. I’ve talked to her about this several times, she cried once saying it was hard for her too and I understand hard, I know it’s hard having a touched-starved, mentally unstable daughter, that’s why I don’t want to bother her with my problems. 

When I happen to have a problem with a member of my family (aunt, uncle or cousin) she’ll always be on their side, it’s like she wants to please them, I don’t feel heard. Im 19 and on my 18th and 19th birthdays i cried, I wanted to spend my 19th birthday doing something I wanted and my parents said yes, that was until my step-dad changed his mind and choose to visit his sister on my birthday 5 hours away hour city, I was mad, I feel like I had the right to. My mom told me that I didn’t have to come with them, that I could stay in the house until they arrived Sunday night (my birthday was on Sunday) I choose to go because I didn’t want to spend the day without my family, I didn’t got to do anything I wanted, I was pretty bummed, my mom and stepdad noticed this and yelled at me saying I didn’t had to be here, that I could’ve stayed in the house, my mom did bought me a cake and ate it when I arrived home and I was grateful for that. My aunt and uncle noticed how my mom and stepdad acted on the day of my birthday and felt bad for me, they told me I should’ve stayed with them and they would’ve took me to the mall. Funny how my mom goes all the way out for his birthday or my sisters birthday. I feel like I’m a failure to them, I’m not the perfect daughter they wish they had, it’s like they just gave up on me, at least is how I see it. Every time I talk to my mom she looks at me with an annoyed face, when I told her that I’m kind of struggling with college she shrugged and told me that it’s my fully because I choose this career, it’s true but I was looking for some encouraging or caring words. I feel what I need is a break.

Note's done. Noose is hung.,"The note is done. Written, edited, signed, done. The noose is cinched and hung. All that's left is for me to decorate the door.

I stood staring at it for what felt like an eternity.

Today, every second had felt like eternity.

I had writhed in agony watching each minute tick by, as if a lifetime had passed. 

I had tried everything I knew and I'd been told: dunked my face in cold water, but my forehead had felt red hot; meditated and focused on my breathing, but I'd retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air; took a scalding bath, for a moment I was in my skin again but then the water and I felt as one; I tried to nap, a reset was always in store, but I woke up still at death's door.

I hadn't done it yet, though. I'd never been closer, but I still hadn't done it. Before I hit send, before I decorated the door, I told myself I'd go for one last run to get out of my head.

I've been treading water the last week, just barely keeping my head up. I tried mushrooms a few days ago and for the first time in what felt like months could accept myself. In fact, I discovered I was stuck in time, two months earlier when I'd been dumped. My heart hadn't moved on, but the universe relentlessly had. And for 24 hours the mushrooms gave me clarity that I needed to move on, and even had. There was a moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly I was vaulted forward to the present. Over and around the intervening months. I was present again. But just as sudden as the revelation had fallen upon me it was stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more. 

Shakily, I put on my running clothes. I considered my route, an old standard. Roughly 3.5 miles. It'd buy me a calculated 24-27 more minutes to think about this decision. I cinched my laces, I hate these shoes. I struck out the door.

When my feet hit the pavement I realized this wasn't a regular jog. I wasn't running to run. I was running to kill myself. Or not. I'd find out along the way. Suddenly the route and distance didn't matter. I knew I'd be going further than I'd thought. I started out at a normal pace and began upping my tempo. I knew I was out of shape. I knew a single 7 minute mile would be my limit, as it had been on several of the past days. But today wasn't those days. I couldn't feel the exhaustion, the pain of my body. Moments earlier, all I could feel was my body exhausted. I was trapped in my head. I could push my body well past it's limits today, because I wasn't leaving my heart or my head until my body hurt more. 

Around the first mile I started muttering to myself: you've never outrun yourself before, but today is the day you beat yourself. And I kept running. I came upon a long flat stretch, a narrow catwalk along the water's edge, and I broke into a sprint. I was going to break myself now. I pushed until I could feel the burn in my legs, my throat and my lungs. I hadn't pushed myself like this in days, weeks, months or maybe even years. I'd forgotten what it felt like. I started feeling light-headed. This was to be alive?

But it couldn't last. I ground to a halt and walked. Finally outside my head again, but still thinking. Finally not drowning in my thoughts.

I'd realized earlier what it is in those last moments. It is quite literally drowning in your thoughts. My brain takes over, dwelling on my past failures, rejections, losses. And it's as if every iota of my brain power is diverted to these fruitless forays in my hippocampus. Every drip of processing is diverted. Suddenly my breathing reflex kicks in. I haven't been breathing. I've been drowning in my thoughts. And with it a sense of fear and dread; adrenaline courses through my aorta, spreading across my chest and dilating my bronchi. Fight or flight, from my own past?

Pushing myself achieves this same end. But what am I running for? What am I running toward? I don't know, and I feel so lost and unbound. Adrift and asea. 

I thought again ""if this is your last run, you're going out strong"" and started sprinting again. I ran, and I ran, and I ran. I ran through throngs of people amidst cherry blossoms who didn't know I was probably running to my death. But suddenly I didn't want to die anymore, at least not yet. Not now. And I started a new mantra ""this run saved my life."" And I realized I could say that every time I ran. Or biked. Or hiked. Or sat with friends. Or worked on a project. Or spoke to my mom. But to do so I'd have to get through those long, dark minutes of pure and intense pain. I'd have to learn to hurt myself, again, running, hiking, biking.

But I kept running, as fast and as hard as I could. I circled back around on my path, it was a lollipop route and I was completing the candy. And I pushed myself until I was back on the inner leg of it, the stem. I pushed myself so hard I started vomiting. In a homeless camp of all places.

I'd had nothing to eat today, and little yesterday. I was subsisting on coffee. The bile came up black, sour, bitter. Much as the coffee had been going down. It seemed a funny parallel. And I decided then that I wanted to write about this. 

I wanted to share my story, because today: I didn't kill myself. I might have, some part of me wanted to. But I ran away. And I'll keep running. It's tough. But I think I found something to run for again. I'd mostly stopped running ages ago, but I think this was the motivation I needed to start again. The rest of my life is in shambles and I don't know what I'm doing. But I can keep running. 

I'll start running with a group, I think. And each time I'll let them know at the end ""this run saved my life."" I'll let them decide what that means to me, and them.",hobohuffer,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkejqb/notes_done_noose_is_hung/
postpartum depression / ocd,"im 21 and 4 mos postpartum. i don’t know if i have ppocd, but the intrusive thoughts are becoming unbearable. my baby is healthy and for the most part happy. a lot of the time, i feel like a shitty mom because i work full time while my boyfriend is at home with the baby and when i get home, im too exhausted to clean house or play with my baby. i carry so much guilt about other people watching my son on my days off so i can get things done, because i’m his mom and i should be able to take care of him and everything else myself. tonight he was losing his sh!t bc he was overtired. his screaming made me feel like i wanted to hurt him or myself. i would never hurt him but the thoughts get so loud i can’t seem to escape them. i was in a psych hospital last month but it didn’t help at all. these thoughts are a constant. sometimes i feel like having a baby was the wrong choice and i ruined my life and the only way to fix my issues is to end it. i just feel so alone",saturnswhore,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tkmz4u/postpartum_depression_ocd/
"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,251,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/

I can't go on,"English isn't my first language so apologise

I've been like this since I was 7 years old, Im 26 now but after going to so many  therapists and with them doing things far worse for me. I can't help thinking about using my  psychiatrist's pills to end it all.

I'm just really tired of being rejected by people or being haunted by the memories of my childhood when I was constatly tortured, honestly the only thing  missed in my childhood was being raped, I'm not exagerating, I swear. Or things like:

Get told everything bad that has happened in my life was my fault or I deserved it

 Get told that I'm ugly, stupid, worthless, that I do not have redeem qualities, that one one could ever love me,  that I'm hated by everyone, or being called F....T  only because I wasn't a pervert like my classmastes at school or that when I grow up I would be a criminal almost all days, again I was just a toddler at the time.

Getting told to kill myself a lot of times. Or that I'm just a weirdo because the way I dress or the colors I wear, the way I eat, talk, etc all of this while I was really depressed because my grandfather was with a disease and I was the only one taking care of him with my grandmother and also I had to cure his ulcers when I was a teenager and saw in agony really crushed me

 I know my conscious is clean , I always did the right thing, I put my well being or things I wanted in life for others but 'm just tired of be treated like like this this, My grandfather died a couple of years ago but I still miss him despite everything, also I hate that my father who had the audacity to left before I was even born tell me I lacked love as a child

I can't even daydream anymore.,"The only thing that helped distract me from the constant suicidal thoughts was living in my own head. Imagining a life I could never have, a family, a partner. Being successful in ways I know now is impossible. It was better to pretend and spend hours, days and years fantasizing as oppose to living in the horrible reality that I'm a suicidal loser. That suicide is my best option. 

But now I can't even do that. Whenever I try to break away from reality for a bit my mind reminds me very cruelly that I'll never have those things. How can I imagine having a partner when no one wants me in real life. How can I imagine going to a good school or doing well in anything when I've failed in everything I try. How can I imagine being loved when no one has ever loved me, not my parents, friends. Nobody. I keep getting snapped back into reality.

"I recently found out that meningoencephalitis is the reason I'm so ill. I feel more connected to the character Abed in the sitcom Community than almost everyone in my life. I've decided that my life isn't worth more than my boyfriend's time and energy, and I must die.","The character of Abed in the show ""Community"", despite not ever being designed to realistically depict all the implied (or explicitly stated) mental health issues he has, is the most relatable character in any media and it makes me emotional. 

TW: suicide, abuse, somewhat significant spoilers for ""Community"". It sounds really stupid, because pretty much anyone that has met anyone that's autistic would know that autistic people aren't really like the character Abed in Community. It's also pretty clear that psychosis is a serious mental illness that doesn't have some sort of sense of closure, that isn't a metaphor for something, it's not something that gets solved with an emotional speech. It's not like that's even a bad thing, it's a sitcom not a documentary, and I find it really funny. I've been trying to escape into a TV shows and S5:E5 ""Geothermal Escapism"" made me so emotional it's hard to even process it, and it feels stupid feeling like this over a sitcom, I mean I've seen people die and could think to myself that they're just an arrangement of atoms the same was a rock is so in the end it doesn't matter. I've been feeling so dumb and detached lately and that it really feels like everyone is just matter the same way an inanimate object is. I learned not to vocalize this, because it's often mistaken for me being unable to feel affective empathy, but it's more than I find it easier to cope with the fact that nobody really cares about me, and that the fact my biological mother hates me and has abused me my entire life is because she's a series of electrical impulses and chemical reactions. It also helps me cope with the fact I say ""biological mother"" because it makes it seem like I have a real one. I have a lot of disorders, but a very glaring symptom is my inability to naturally physically express emotion, which I barely feel anyway. 


A couple days ago I got out of a psychiatric hospital because I tried to kill myself. I remember saying that I knew that I'd live but I wanted people to take me seriously. That was a lie, I wanted to die but didn't want to admit I'd leave everyone behind. I've been feeling incredibly ill lately and have had debilitating headaches constantly, apparently I have meningoencephalitis but nobody realized it because I can't express things. I don't even remember trying to kill myself. I remember thinking about doing it, I don't remember doing it though, just brief flashes of being in an ambulance. It's so incredibly painful and I barely know what's even going on, painkillers don't work mostly because this is opiate level pain but people don't believe me, because even if you can visibly see on a scan of my brain that it is inflamed, a nurse knows better than to give me morphine. It probably wouldn't work anyway, I used to IV fentanyl when I was younger quite frequently. Even though tolerances should eventually reset, I feel like to a certain extent they aren't resetting. My ears are constantly ringing, and when I saw my boyfriend he had to type we had to type in notes to talk and I didn't even want to be around him because I'm so drained all the time. I wouldn't know if that was a week ago, an hour ago, it feels like it's all losing meaning now. I don't want to be the one to end my life, I want whatever version tried last time, when I didn't remember. I just don't want to have to think about whether or not it makes sense to die. 


When I saw S5:E5 of Community, the there was a scene where Abed was finding it difficult to let go of his friend, so much that he made an imaginary world for himself. That made me so sad, because that's what I do all the time because I can't talk to people. I've been having this feeling like I'm going to scream, and my jaw shakes slightly and I can hear my teeth clatter. The episode S2:E11 ""Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas"" had a similar effect, but I can't even talk about that one. It's nothing anyone else can notice. There have been four periods in my life this has happened, the first is when my ex partner said I was a horrible, selfish, narcissistic maniac that never loved him, when my mother compared me to the antagonist in the movie ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"", when I decided I had to give up opiates, and now when my boyfriend is talking time away from university to comfort someone that has already made up their mind in wanting to die. I think these are moments when normal people cry. There's a lot of positivity about neurodiversity, but the truth is someone like me isn't part of any community, I'm too different from even the different people. I wanted to say this because I feel okay enough to type right now. I wish I could tell my boyfriend I love him like a normal person does, I imagine it constantly but I never feel like someone could ever truly get someone like me even if they tried.

Should I just kill myself?,"I'm trans which automatically means more than half of the world wishes me death, suffering, or containment. Great start. I have trauma that's basically just my fault. If I wasn't trans I wouldn't have been sexually abused and harassed the way I was. If I wasn't trans I would've had people in my life who could understand me. I'd finally be part of the majority and I wouldn't have so many people harassing me daily and saying I'm not real. People hate me for something I can't change and I'm miserable pretending it isn't real. Why should I live when no one wants me to. If I wasn't trans I would have parents who I could have a real relationship with. Maybe I would've had someone who truly loves me. But I don't. I can't just stop being this way. I can't just erase my childhood of severe trauma and replace it with a normal one. 

The only ones I have are my dogs, and they'll die soon. I'll be left again. I'm always left. No one really loves me. It doesn't matter how good I am. I thought that if I could prove I had worth by excelling maybe people would like me, and I was right a lot of people did like me, but I was just put on a pedestal again separating me from others. I'm always a victim. It doesn't matter how good I am at things or whatever ""potential"" I have because in the end I'm just a tool. I'm disgusting unless exploited and I'm not allowed to have opinions. I want to die. I can't live like this. I can't live knowing no one is there for me. No one is like me. I'm so alone. I don't even hate myself it's just that I want to protect whatever broken child is left there from all this bullshit that keeps coming from the world, and at this point I'm sure that the only way I can do that is by dying. At least if I die it won't continue. I can't be hurt anymore. I can't be used anymore. I've been suicidal since I was 5. 5 years old. My life has been so cruel that even before I was old enough to spell ""great"" correctly I was already comfortable with the idea of not existing. I didn't even really know what death was yet but I just wanted to shut off life. No one has helped me. I've had to grow up teaching myself everything.

I'm pretty sure if I keep living I'll end up getting even more desperate for someone to care about me that I'll just become a sleeze in order to have any semblance to closeness to another person. I'd already probably sleep with anyone at this point just for that hit of oxytocin.

I just wish someone cared about me enough to be there. All I'm asking is someone who *tries*. Someone who at the very least doesn't intend to hurt me. Someone with good intentions who tries at all to understand me or be there for me. But the closest I've gotten to that was teachers. I feel disgusting. I can't separate my emotions because I'm so broken that everything is basically just lust. I want someone to hold me. I just want someone to support me. I wish I had someone other than myself to depend on.

I thought my life would turn out okay but I’m 29 and want to die more everyday.,"Single 29 year old female with 2 dogs and 0 kids and 0 friends. I’ve been extremely depressed since I was a kid but always thought I’d grow out of it and life would fall into place. The last 2 years have destroyed a lot of progress I made mentally because of working from home/living alone and being in complete and total isolation for over 2 years now. Was lonely before but this has been an absolute mind fuck. I have been trying my best to maintain sanity and have a shrink and decided to finish my college degree but the loneliness just stings no matter what I do to fill my time.

But lately I thought things were on the up &amp; up. Interviewed for a new position at work that’s higher paying, met a great guy I felt a connection with. College graduation is close enough now that I can see the light at the end of the “poor as fuck” tunnel. But out of nowhere, last Wednesday I got a notice that my rental company isn’t renewing my lease (not sure why, no infractions but don’t have the energy to fight it) and I can’t afford to move on such short notice as I drained my savings (which wasn’t much, just a couple thousand) about a year ago moving into this place (never live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building) and right now I only make $18 an hour so I haven’t been able to replenish savings yet. This place was a little out of my budget to begin with but it was on the lower side for rents in my area for 2 bedrooms (need an office). I just don’t have the money for a deposit, pet deposit, first months rent and paying for movers in my bank account right now. As a result I’m moving back in with my parents, 14 year old brother, and severely autistic 17 year old sister in a small house. I moved out after highschool at 18 because my mom is a high strung and mean crazy person, and with my sister being autistic and having outbursts all the time the place is a fuckin’ zoo. But this temporary move in with them will allow me to save money for a few months. 

A couple of months ago I met a guy who I really, really like and for once he seems to like me back. We made lots of plans to do a bunch of outdoorsy things like foraging and fishing because I’ve always wanted to do that stuff and he does those as hobbies already. We used to talk everyday and hung out probably 6-7 times and while we were still getting to know each other I felt like we had a good thing going with lots of potential. I told him about my having to move temporarily, and even though I’ll only be 2 hours away and work from home/have my own car so I can come see him as often as we wanted - he has dropped me as a result. Has just gone totally cold no contact and I feel like fucking shit.

I know I shouldn’t care, we weren’t dating yet. But I have such a hard time meeting men let alone decent men that reciprocate attraction. That in tandem with the extreme loneliness I’ve been stuck inside of since being forced inside back in March of 2020, this is just such a huge let down that all seems to be coming out of nowhere. Having someone to look forward to talking to and see on a regular basis meant so much more to me than I think anyone else can understand. I am almost 30 and I’m nowhere near getting married and having kids which is honestly all I want to do with my life. So the letdown from this seems like it should roll off my back but I just cannot win. 

I cannot get close to anyone and I won’t ever be able to find a partner and live the simple life I so desperately want. On top of that I’m going to be 30 in June and I am moving back in with my parents and that living situation is going to be stressful. I’ve never been farther away from where I wanted to be. I feel utterly broken inside. If I didn’t have 2 chihuahuas who would be left unattended/unfed in the numerous days it would be before anyone noticed something was “off” because that’s how isolated I am - I would have killed myself in the garage yesterday. I made an appointment with my therapist but I can’t see her until 2nd week of April. I just don’t want to do this anymore, I’m so tired of feeling nothing except hurt and lonely. I don’t have anyone to talk to in real life so this post is just me trying to get some of the shit out of my system. Thanks.",bingbong182420,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnrxcu/i_thought_my_life_would_turn_out_okay_but_im_29/
"I want to kms. My parents have abused me emotionally; physically and sexually for my whole life, the girl who I’ve chased after for years blocked me, and the last thing I want to do is push the burden on my friends. Please tell me either a way out of this situation or a quick way out of my life.","I’m a ginger junior male in high school, and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka Mormon bc President Nelson told us not to say that anymore) and I really want to go. Trigger warning for anyone who has issues with any sort of abuse.
My parents are monsters. I was uncircumcised birth. My dad was strongly against it, despite circumcision being better in every way. Due to me having a very sensitive foreskin, I wouldn’t clean it. My parents found out about this, and decided to forcefully start cleaning it. I was monitored in the bathroom, pinned to shower walls and beds and essentially tortured from when I can remember to fifth grade. It haunts me still today. I was beat multiple times a week as a kid, some of the times being completely unreasonable. The worst ones were when I was twelve. I accused my mom of abusing me after a beating once. She acknowledged that and openly said she was going to show me real abuse, tackled me, punched and slapped me until we were both trembling from crying. I was mowing the lawn once, and my dad was watching me. I went over a large and flat patch of grass, which it didn’t cut effectively. My dad told me to go over it again, so I did. It had no effect. After telling him this, he got very upset. I don’t even see him coming. I only saw the sky before I was slammed to the ground. I was punched in the face repeatedly until I had nearly lost consciousness. A few hours later when we were at my grandma’s house for a celebration, he gave me the most half-assed apology I’ve ever heard. Through this trauma, instead of hiding away, I swore revenge. I swore that I would kill them one day and avenge myself and my siblings who’ve gone through it too. Although I’ve taken abuse many more times than them, I swore to be their hero. I’ve gained my black belt and I’m one of the fastest runners in my city due to my determination. I’ve openly let them know that I hate them. Yet, they still love me and try to fix their relationship with me. After I snapped at them a couple of weeks ago, they tried to send me to family counseling, to which I refused to do. When they set up an appointment, I ran away for a couple of hours. My mom tried to talk it through with me and try to help, but she just ended up defending her actions.  God said that sexual sins of any kind were unforgivable, so I swore to never forgive them. No matter how much they love me and try to fix this relationship, I refuse to do so. I’ve trained my whole life to kill them. I will always hate them, no matter what consequences face me.
My school life has been terrible as well. I was moved from my original school because the school system wouldn’t put me in an advanced learning program, but I was too smart for the base level classes. I was bullied at the new school for a long time. Once I made friends at that school, I moved again three years later. My mom didn’t like a kid in my class changing genders. I was bullied to near suicide at the new school, but I eventually made friends. My mom made me go to a different middle school because she got tired of driving my brother to the bus stop of the school that I wanted to go to. So I got the short end of the stick, and went to a completely different school. I luckily got along with everyone there and I haven’t moved since. But I still suffer from their decisions. I was beat for not getting As all throughout middle school. When I was diagnosed with ADD, they just increased their focus upon my restricted freedom and lost even more trust in me. This still happens today. I typically get very good grades. My worst grade up until last quarter was a B+. But due to the pressure that began to weigh on me last quarter, it’s fallen to a B. I feel terrible, but I at the same time, nothing would feel more freeing than not caring about my grades for one quarter. I want to so badly, but I know that my future might be significantly worse if I do that.
The one person that took my mind off of all the abuse was a girl that I met in sixth grade. She was pretty, kind and caring.
Even though I did some incredibly mean things to her, she always forgave me. I fell madly in love with her, and I still am. She even liked me for a little while, even though she didn’t tell me. But my mom made me move because of the bus situation. Leaving her was so traumatizing, I started breaking God’s commandments to help cope with the pain. I started cussing, watching porn and jacking off all because I wanted to feel a feeling that was a smidgen close to what it was like being with her. Now, I’ve been watching porn almost every day for over four years, jacking off almost every day for two years, and cussing for longer. I miss her so much. I’ve avoided girls who’ve liked me because she’s so important to me (they were also kind of crazy so it’s justified). I would do just about anything in the world to have her back.
Recently, my entire life and my goals have flipped on their head. In seminary, I watched a video on why we need to forgive others and it showed an example of a man who forgave a drunk teen for killing his whole family in an accident. That tore me, because that’s worse than what I’ve gone through. But at the same time, murder and sexual sin are unforgivable in the eyes of God. Then why did the Church approve its message? I still don’t know why, but my seminary teacher told the whole class to forgive everyone we haven’t forgiven yet, no matter what. I lost a big chunk of me that day. I’ve crafted my entire lifestyle around never forgiving them, but now I’m suddenly expected to forgive them on a whim. Why would I have forgive them if God won’t?
The girl that I like emailed me sometime last year telling me that she missed me. Of course , I was ecstatic. We started talking, but I got too nervous to talk to her. We talked on and off for a few months, but we hit radio silence. About six months ago, I remembered that she turned sixteen, and we could date while not breaking the rule the Church set. We started talking again after some communication difficulty. For some reason, the message I sent didn’t deliver for thirteen days. We were taking inconsistently until winter break, when I started texting her frequently. I told her merry christmas on christmas morning, and the message still hasn’t delivered. I assumed that she hadn’t blocked me, because the message hadnt turned green in iphone. I saw a concert earlier today, and I saw the girl that I like performing in it. I was star-struck. Everything around me went black, and she was the only thing that I could see. I almost said hi to her after the concert, but she was talking with her family, so I didn’t. I tried calling her, but it automatically went to voicemail. I tried masking my number, and she picked up the phone. I sat in disbelief for a long time after realizing that she blocked me. Apparently, I fucked up so badly that the nicest person I’ve ever met blocked me.
With my two motivators in life being completely shut down in just two weeks, my mental has taken a severe drop. I’m performing poorly at races and I’ve been doing badly in school. While I want to try being bad at school, mom won’t stand for that any day. Racing is my passion, and now that I have my two motivators and my passion mostly stripped from me, the only thing I have to live for is my friends and siblings. Although my friends and sibling live and care for me, as I do the same thing for them, I can’t help but feel like killing myself nonstop. I want to keep my friends out of my situation because I don’t want shove my burdens onto them. Either I kill myself quickly or I suffer knowing I’m the biggest clown of all time. I don’t care about the consequences God sets on suicidal people. Suicidal people go to spiritual prison for some odd reason. I know that the Church is correct, and just don’t understand why that is. If iI kill myself now, I’ll have less memories to be tortured over in spiritual prison. I know I’m going to go there due to my masterbation addiction. If there are any solutions, please tell me or dm me. This is a very shortened version of the whole situation.

Sometimes life gets so stressful that I feel like ending it will be the most peaceful solution.,"I’ve had thoughts of suicide since I was very young. What stops me is knowing that someone I know is going to be the one to find me, or the people I know will feel guilty that they didn’t do something more to help me. In reality I hide my depression very well from others. I’ve had to come out to people and tell them I suffer with severe depression and they always give me this weird look like “are you sure” or tell me sincerely that they had no idea that I could be struggling with that. 
I tend to keep to myself so most people don’t know about my struggles, especially the struggles that deepen my depression. I recently got a really great treatment for my depression that helped more than I could imagine and haven’t had serious struggles for almost three month. Which is the longest period of time I haven’t dealt with depression since very early in my childhood. I’m 26 now. 
After a rough week of different things getting worse every day, I had suicidal thoughts again. I don’t plan on every committing the act, I don’t think I ever could. But I do get these thoughts about how peaceful it would be. And for whatever reason my mind thinks that if I ended this life then I would get to restart another life, hopefully less depressed and with less life struggles and less trauma the next time around. I know that’s not how I would be thinking if I was being my usual logical self. But life is just so rough and unfair most of the time and it’s so painful.",nutbutter_butternut,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnblei/sometimes_life_gets_so_stressful_that_i_feel_like/

I don't know what to do,"I'm 24(M). I got married at 22 to a beautiful girl, then had a baby the following year. The moment she was born I struggled, and I don't even know what with. I just felt like a terrible dad. This got slowly worse until last October time I decided my wife would be better without me. I distanced myself from her, started basically making her feel like I didn't love her. I was lazy, inconsiderate and never helped with anything. My work went downhill, I barely do any work. I'm lazy there and because I work at home I get away with the bare minimum, doing things super last minute and just hanging on.

I stopped my wife from selling her house (lived in it together but she bought it before we got together) because I thought she'd be better keeping it and having it on her own than owning a house with me.

Then in January we broke up. I had been so distant and awful that she left. Within a week I regretted my decision, because I really love her. So much. I just feel like a terrible dad and terrible husband. I tried to be better, and we did well.  Then I went away with work for a week and I just fell back again as I sat in the hotel at night with my own thoughts.
I came back and just distanced myself again. She's better without me and I know it. We broke up a week ago.
I really love her and I miss her and I really just want to tell her that I've genuinely considered killing myself because I feel like such a bad dad. Not for attention, I just know she's the only person I can talk to. I'm that typical guy though who doesn't want to talk.  I never spoke about it and now I've lost her.

I'd love to speak to her about it but I also know she's going on a date soon now so there's no point. I've booked to go to Finland at the end of April, and I am planning on not coming home. I figured at least if I went missing or killed myself there, it wouldn't be friends or family finding me.

This world is so fucking exhausting,"The endless grind and monotony, the constant clamoring for worthless produce and commodities just to earn the right to sustain your life — I've grown so sick of this tedious state of being and the vapid, meaningless culture we've built around it. I'm so sick of capitalism and how the current economic system seems to only function to bleed most people dry, pressuring them to shave away the better part of their lives wasting away in a state of suffocating malaise, only for that monetary value they spend their years producing to get funneled straight into the pockets of some self-absorbed, narcissistic rich fuck that could never possibly understand the concept of empathy and altruism. I didn't ask to be born, yet it seems as though I'm also filled with the crippling weight of having to constantly justify the space I occupy and the resources I consume every waking second of the day, with the constant dread of being reduced to some starving, homeless bottom-feeder tailing not too far behind. This state of being may be exciting to some, but it isn't to me. It wears me out.

I wish this world was kinder — as hospitable, as generous and accommodating as they so desperately want you to believe. This state of unrelenting, cut-throat competition might hold appeal to some, but it doesn't to me. It wears me out. The incoherent squabbling and vicious warring for chunks of land and food to eat hasn't budged one bit from our prehistoric days, nor has it become more sophisticated — we've simply used these ancient impulses to justify acting upon this behavior in a much broader scale, as though vain self-indulgence is the only real virtue in this world. The sheer scale of damage that the human race has caused in this pursuit is unfathomable, and it only intensifies and exponentiates with every year that limps by. It wears me out.

I wish I wasn't an actively suicidal, blubbering mess — I've tried, I've really have, and I'm climbed a good deal out of the bottomless pit I dug for myself in my teenage years, but it's not enough. They say it gets better, that there's some glint of optimistic waiting for everybody on the other side, and while that might be true, I don't have the strength or willpower to go searching for it anymore. Suicide is a systemic problem before it's a personal one, and as long as society at large fails to recognize this, all they can do is sit in apparent bafflement as their token sympathies and shallow social programs still inevitably result in annual suicide rates racing upwards. 

This wound up being kind of long-winded and tangential, but hopefully some of you can relate. I'm writing this petrified of what I'm about to do soon, but hopefully I can take comfort in the idea of slipping into sleep and waking up in a better world.",Monno_LeCranc,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnxvyw/this_world_is_so_fucking_exhausting/

"My life is good, but I can't fill this void in my chest","I have a good job (government employee), I make good money and been told that I'm good looking, but I just can't feel happiness anymore.

I just can't feel like I used to anymore... I just feel this dread and sadness all the time, like there's a hole in my chest that weights like 1000kg and sucks all my happiness away.

I never told anyone this, but I have suicidal thoughts since I was little, but I could like easily control them... Like I used to have them only when I was sad, but now it seems like even when I'm suppose to be happy, I feel this thing on my chest, and a heavy feeling of dread and sadness, even if I'm surrounded by people I love and having a good time.

When I'm very drunk or high in heavy drugs (cocaine or something like that), that feeling just magically goes away, and I enter an euphoria-like state. But I just can't be drunk or high forever, nor do I want to get addicted to them.

I thought that when I got a good job and good money I would finally be happy, but it just feels the same.

I don't think I really want to die... But I don't know how long I can take this... I look at other people sometimes in a worse situation that I'm in, and I just can't understand how they can be happy and smile...

I need reasons to not kill myself today,"Hi there,

I’d like to share a few words that may help me and others in this very intense emotional pain.

I (girl, 28) broke up with who I loved deeply in November, 2019 as soon as she displayed emotional and physical abuse on me. Shortly after that, I met someone with who I experienced a connection I have never felt before, I just lost her as well this week, after she told me she can’t see herself in a committed, traditional romantic relationship with anyone. Long before this I was with a married man for so long that only thinking about it makes me want to die. My family is broken and careless about each other’s emotions while I am a caring human being who suffers with other people‘s suffering, specially the type that is unnecessary and destroys family homes. All I ever wanted was a family, and they took it from me.

I know, intellectually, that we come to this world to learn and experience, that suffering doesn’t last forever and better days are coming but this is so different to the way I feel inside. 

I feel so alone in the world. Nothing excites about being alive. All I want is someone to love me and be there for me, to stay yet I rarely like and are able to connect with someone. 

Today I went to the supermarket and I had to come back because I start randomly crying any time any where. My chest feels heavy and tight and all I do is overthink about this girl and check her social media, I’ve deleted her from my network but her profiles are public so that doesn’t stop me from doing it. I haven’t eaten since yesterday and to be honest, I’m not hungry. 

I feel so alone, I don’t like my job yet it’s on me to financially support myself and save to perhaps buy a house of my own and settle. Yet I’m so scared to settle, because I feel it doesn’t matter where I go, the problem is within, is me. I live far from my family - and that it’s a good thing as they are very hurting and toxic - in a country that is cold and grey most of the time, yet coming back may be a financial suicide. And also it may not improve my well being. I’m just so tired and I feel there’s no escape.

My husband is suicidal and I'm not sure how to help,"My husband has struggled with money all his life. He has a very specific mindset about working in a capitalism society too. He hates that everything revolves around money and he wishes for a better world that I'm afraid he'll never get to see.

I've been supporting the both of us financially but the ship has been sinking as we're thousands of dollars in debt. He lost his job back in January and hasn't had another job lined up since, and I've been dealing with a lot of uncomfortable conversations with people we're borrowing money from. I've been trying my best to be supportive of him and allow him time to figure himself out, but like I said my income isn't enough to keep us afloat and our resources are depleted.

Today I spoke to him and tried to explain that life will always come with problems to face but he kept countering me with ""It's always to same problem with money."" He's convinced himself that suicide is the only way out of this problem with money, because he'll never get to live the life we've dreamed of: homesteading.

Gambling leads to suicide,"If I was asked by other people about reasons for suicide, I think for 99% cases I would come up with some support and reasoning not to do it. In my own case I think it\`\`s rather reasonable. Where am I wrong?

I\`\`\`\`m addicted to gambling on stock exhange. I lost 2 apartments and the scale is big.

I lied to all friends begging for money to gamble back. Wife left.

Bancruptcy in my country is complicated and unlikely to relieve all debts. More likely some creditors will put me in jail.

Currently writing my suicide letter,"Will write last will &amp; testament shortly after, in a separate document.",mahboilo7,36,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tn8j37/currently_writing_my_suicide_letter/
i am a complete failure and i don't know how to change things around,"i am 23 years old and i am a failue. i have no idea what career to pursue and i am almost completely lonely.

i am currently studying media studies at university without any real passion for it. i'd change it but the problem is whatever thing i may choose are things that can't really give me any job opportunities, especially here in Italy. i don't really have any ability to pursue stems degrees since i don't have any talent or passion for those, otherwise i would have already tried it even though i don't really like that field. but i can't and so i am stuck doing what i am doing. i probably won't get many decent jobs at all and my life will suck. i have asked and looked for advice however i could - internet included, but it seems no one is truly able to help me. Not even my therapist seems to know how to help me and she's basically suggesting to simply continue what i am doing so that i will at least have a degree. even if i am able to do it, i'm afraid i'll be too old for the job market as it will take me between three and five years at best. i just can't think of any alternatives and it seems like no one else can. i am also lonely as i have almost zero friends and i've never had a girlfriend. Not having friends doesn't really bother me that much strangely, not having a girlfriend does and it gives me pain. i am always afraid of being too ugly or unlikeable to be liked by someone. i get told that i should focus on myself but i just can't. especially since my life is going down the drain it seems. i just can't focus on anything and it seems like there's no hope for me. i just want to cry, i don't think i can handle it much longer",CalmFrank,19,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnp0mh/i_am_a_complete_failure_and_i_dont_know_how_to/
"it all makes sense now. god/the universe/spirit wants me to kill myself. That's when I'll finally have peace. All the abuse, trauma, triggering messages, ""tests"", challenges, toxic people- they couldn't say kill yourself. I had to know myself. I had figure it out. But I'm finally gonna be free.","Think about it. A life of abuse and I escape and there's more abuse. I'm out of money.  Every problem I solve, there's ten more coming for me. I was born ""pretty"" but people matyr anyone who dies young. I've been obsessed with people who died young my whole life. I thought it was because I took it as a reason to keep going and trying but it's because I'm supposed to be one of them too. 

 Maybe my purpose is served after death. Maybe it'll inspire someone or something idk. They always show those black and white photos of people who died young and talk about how they were so pretty and had so much ambition etc etc. They'll talk about my unmet goals of being a dancer and model. How it could've been great. But I'll finally be free and have everything I wanted when I'm dead. There won't be anymore worrying about money or abusive people. No more mental health issues. No more surviving in a crazy shit world full of crazy shit people. 

why else would it keep getting worse? Why did they send those triggering messages on tiktok last night? Because they can't drive me to suicide but I had to choose it myself. True freedom. All the tests and challenges, it was to help me get here. I asked for peace. Stability. surrounded by good people forever. no more worries and trauma and pain. you wont find that on earth especially as a human. that only exists when everything is over.

it all makes sense. I just have to do it this morning and then I'm free.

I feel like Rapunzel and the only escape is jumping from this tower.,"I never leave this room. I'm scared of everyone and all the terrible things that can go wrong out in the real world. I used to be so colorful, but now everything is just grey. My mother is mentally ill as well and my family blames me being around her for my depression...but it's just not that simple. Yes, I have trauma but most days I just don't care...like about anything. Like everything feels pointless and meaningless. I'm not sad about a particular thing really...it's everything. And nothing. All I do most days is lay in bed and listen to depressing music while I hurt myself. I have no friends, but to be fair I really don't know if I want any. Sometimes I convince myself that I'm just this thing without a soul. I look like a person, but I don't have dreams...desires. I wrote in my journal today that I feel like I'm just a vessel for terrible and selfish coping mechanisms. I don't do anything in pursuit of something greater...because I don't think there is anything greater. When I was in grippy sock jail for an attempt I lied to everyone about everything. I told them I didn't want to die, and I blamed it all on my parents. That they hurt me and I just wanted to escape. They did hurt me...but the truth was I just felt nothing. I always feel nothing. And anything I do is just an action to hopefully inspire some sort of feeling...But it never works. I make music. I paint. But it's all just nothing. It's nothing. I want something more. But it's not coming. I stare at the same damn walls. My family tries so hard to inspire me, and it hurts that they love me so much. They bring me food, they call my doctors; sit and listen to my pessimistic ramblings...and It's not enough. And I hate that it's not enough. I tell everyone around me how suicidal I am, and I can hear how pathetic I sound. I'm like a broken record. ""I want to die"" ""I want to sleep and never wake up""...I keep praying every day for the courage to try to end this again. I miss eating without worrying about calories, or my arm without scars. I've been so terrible to myself. And I am so very sorry. I know I don't deserve this. But I wanted to feel what everyone else seems to feel...so I had to destroy myself. I'm so sorry. I love you.

I see no point.,"Forgive me but if anyone would indulge me I’d appreciate it. I’ve tried calling helplines countless times and got nowhere.

I see no point in me living. I don’t live anyway, I can only exist. I’m 23 and I have autism, but I’m not here to blame everything on autism, because people with autism can have happy lives. It’s just my personality as a whole which is the issue. I’m also an INTP, for anyone who buys into that stuff. I’m not sure I do tbh but I feel it gives a decent explanation of many of my traits and behaviours.

I’m just so utterly depressed. No one gets me at all and I can’t blame them. I don’t often get other people.
I’m so stuck in my own head I can’t just live, no matter how hard I try.
I’ve tried counselling with 3 different people, different medications including citalopram and fluoxetine to no avail.
The fundamental problem is me.

I’d been considering TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) for a long time and yesterday I decided screw it, I’ll try.
I never spend any money and I’m very usually very tight, but I decided what is the point having money if I’m miserable, so I’ve given them £4,000 for the treatment. I start next week and is the last bit of faint hope I have of anything working for me.
The chances are still very small and it likely won’t work any miracles.

I’m trying to hold out till next week to see if the TMS helps, otherwise I’ll kill myself knowing I’ve tried everything.
However I just keep having the thoughts and it’s painful.

My family loves me and my mum took me in for the last 3 months because she was worried I’d do something.
I just don’t see the point of living, even for them.

I don’t say all of this just to go boohoo me. I understand in some ways I’m actually very lucky. I have a family that loves me, the means to rent somewhere of my own to live and stuff like that and I remind myself of that everyday.
Lots of people have problems in their lives and I totally understand that.

I just feel so separate from everyone and I don’t see it ever changing. I’m distant from everyone I’ve ever known and the idea of having long terms friendships or relationships is off the cards for me.
For starters, I wouldn’t get a gf just on looks alone, because I’m ugly.

I’ve just had my braces (had them on for a jaw issue mainly) off and I look even worse now than I did before.
I’ve had a couple of girls ask me out in the last year and that’s literally it.

This is going to sound really childish and I’ve never told anyone this, but I am a bit resentful. Not in a screwed up way so don’t worry I’m going to be violent or something. I don’t mean like that.

I guess my brother, who also has autism, is taller and bigger than me and better looking and actually had a personality.
For starters, I’m only 6ft1 and I’m skinny as hell (I know the skinniness is something I could work on).
Im lazy and get lost in my own world. Always have done. He wants to get out there and impress people. I just don’t care to for whatever reason.

Having said all of that, I’m actually happy for my brother. He has autism too like me and I relate to him more than anyone else. I’d say we’re kind of close in a love hate way as is probably common with brothers.
He’s always said he looks up to me and he got all his interests and ideas from me growing up, but that’s only natural anyway because I’m the older brother.

I’ve heard things like ‘just get out there and see what happens’ but it doesn’t work because of how I think. I’m too stuck in my own head to enjoy 95% of things. I feel like joining in with others or becoming involved with people is ‘cringe’ in some way. It’s weird and it holds me back but I can’t change the way I see it.
I would never ever want to be shallow.
The obvious answer is to get over that thought but I can’t rewire my whole brain.

I could whinge for more paragraphs but it would be pointless. A lot of shit’s happened. If anyone bothered to read this mess of a post thanks. 

I just needed to get some stuff off my chest. I’m still strongly considering ending it all and I’ve just had a rope delivered, but on the off chance I have a sudden change of heart, thanks for your response.",musejonno,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnq8ow/i_see_no_point/
Almost Actually Committed Suicide Yesterday,"I've been suicidal for a long time now -- since I was about six years old. It was around that age that I also wrote my first suicide note.

I went through some pretty tough stuff in my life. I grew up in an abusive household (thanks to having an abusive father) until I was thirteen, my mom got cancer after that, and my brother has had autism all his life and I can't get to see him because he's with my dad (the court decided that he should be with him regardless of his abusive nature and only mainly because he has the financial capacities -- yeah, our justice system is pretty effed up). When I was around twelve, I kinda pretty much felt hopeless about life, and I sort of lost touch with emotions. The only emotions I could feel are despair and sadness. Happiness appears from time to time, yet it remains fleeting -- and in a VERY quick way. Waking up every day feels like a chore and even if I want to help around (although I pretty much do, because I study hard and have two jobs -- but that isn't enough because I can't do the chores properly since I'm always fucking exhausted and useless), I can't, because my mind always feels like it's all over the place and like I'm going crazy. I suspect I might have OCD or any other underlying mental health conditions (my counselor assumes so as well, but I totally ghosted her because I wasn't feeling well) which makes living every day even HARDER. That's why every mistake ends up with me attempting suicide.

Yesterday, I made another stupid mistake and my mom got angry at me. This resulted me into finally thinking that I really should kill myself. I wrote a suicide note and everything and had the medicine to overdose myself prepared. I stopped, though, because a notification of a message from my best friend whom I told I was going to kill myself popped up and she offered to call me. I did end up calling her when I suddenly got back a bit to my senses and I broke down in the middle of the call.

I'm recovering now from last night's suicide attempt and I pretty much logged it into my suicide attempt records which is a notebook I designed together with a suicide first aid kit so that I could see my unhealthy patterns of behavior and shake myself back to my senses. My mom is still pretty much angry at me but it's not like she knows everything that happened since she was out last night.

I think I'm going to go back to counseling services to do my best to break this unhealthy behavior. Wish me luck, I guess?

So, that's it. I just felt like I needed an outlet to put all of this out. Thanks for reading!",thatoddball8,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnb0c1/almost_actually_committed_suicide_yesterday/

Please read🙏🏻,"Well.. Don’t not know what's happening and why. I've been trying to commit su!c!de since the end of last year. As you can see, it doesn’t seem to work. Every time. So I'm here to explain the reasons for the failed attempts, and to possibly get answers to why this is happening. 

The first time I tried to attempt, was dy!ng of freezing in my room by opening the window completely. (It was winter, snow outside, the weather was freezing cold and the temperature was minus). Before I even got started, there came a terrible and cruel storm and hurricane that hadn’t been in my country since 2013. It lasted for a few weeks. Which we were all forced not to open our windows or drive outside. The storm and hurricane were so strong that most of the trees fell, and all the houses, apartments and buildings shook like crazy. Therefore, I had to postpone. When the storm and hurricane disappeared, the snow melted too, and it got a little warmer. Therefore, I left the freezing method and moved on to the hang!ng method. 

Many of the other attempts were constantly interrupted when my mother, who leaves me the whole day and is in her room because she hates me, slams my door to get in, (She doesn’t even know I'm about to hang myself), and it happens every time and only a few seconds before I plan to jump off the chair. That's why I never get peace to do it. 

I decided to attempt again when she one day leaves the home to buy medicine. She did. And I hurried out to the bathroom, tied a scarf on the curtain rod and hung myself. I stood there hang!ng for about half an hour. I suffered a lot. Without anything happening. Neither unconsciousness nor death. Just pure suffering. (The ensuing symptoms killed me the rest of the day and the days ahead, shit). Then I hopelessly chose to end the experiment. 

Subsequently, I tried to attempt again. Just as I was about to kick the chair away in the bathroom to hang myself, my mom came. She stayed standing by the bathroom trying to get me out. She kept disturbing and wouldn’t go, so I decided to go out. Again, all the times she has neither seen nor known that I would commit su!c!de. 

The last time I tried to hang myself, something scary happened. I went out to the bathroom and wrapped a string around my neck, sat down and waited to be strangled to death. After about 10 seconds, I looked at the toilet. (By the way, the toilet lid was closed. The toilet is like a mirror, you can see everything in front of it). When I looked at the toilet, (still while I sit down and wait for my death), I could suddenly see in the toilet mirror the shadow of an insanely creepy (witch) I guess, with big, round white eyes, long white dress and black, thick, messy hair. Out of fear, I panicked and hurried to tie up the knot, and frightened I rushed out of the bathroom with my heart galloping. It has scared me ever since, which has kept me from trying again. 

The many other attempts at suffocation with plastic bags and swallow pills didn’t work either.

Sorry my long novel, I even tried to make it short. Anyway, what the hell is going on? What was the scary thing I saw in the toilet mirror? Why am I prevented in my attempts every time?

I think it’s time,"I’ve been holding on for my wife of fifteen years. But she’s moved up in her career and has outgrown me; I’m just going round and round in circles in a bullshit and pointless line of work. She has grown more distant as her status and mine diverge sharply, and no longer confides in me. Which is all understandable as we now have less and less in common. I’d give it six months before she works up to divorcing me.

I jettisoned my dreams of making art, sensibly, to pursue work that will pay the bills. So now I’m just some 40+, middle aged loser with an empty life. I feared I’d lose her when she finally grasped the brass ring, but I made the decision to support her through all the trials and difficulty because I love her and it would be terrible *not* to do it.

What’s left of my family is half the world away and my friends have moved on as they started their own families and started moving up in their own careers.

The world does *not* need unattached middle aged males in stunted worthless careers. When I end it my wife will get all the accounts and our place, which should set her up nicely.

Struggling to live for them,"Everyday I feel more and more drained. I've been skipping my medications/appointments more often and I honestly cannot make myself care. Sometimes I wish I could just get over whatever is stopping me from finally giving up, but I know it would hurt the people I love and care about.

 My friends are struggling to keep up with my mood swings and I feel so terrible. I feel like a burden. It's embarrassing, I burst into tears over the smallest inconvenience and frequently ruin previously fun situations. My best friend and I are slowly drifting apart due to this. He tries so hard to reach out, but I'm struggling to even voice my thoughts anymore. We no longer have the same bond we had before.

 I haven't been to classes in weeks or brushed my teeth, and I'm switching between barely eating, or overeating to cope. I feel disgusting, the only thing I can do to take care of myself anymore is shower. I'm terrified that my behaviors are going to drive away my friends, who are all I have to live for at this point. I really do want to try but I just cannot find a way to motivate myself. I'm so unhappy. I know that I'm young and that there's got to be more to life than this, but it's so hard to see that sometimes. I've made promises to my loved ones that I'll get through this but I honestly don't see that happening anymore.

 Sometimes I have these daydreams where I'm free from all of this pointless pain, where the love of my life comes in and sweeps me off of my feet like some knight in shining armor. I really thought meeting someone who romantically interested me would help. I mean it seems to do the trick in fiction right? I would find the perfect person and we would help each other through our issues in a beautiful way. I could get away from my empty life and go live in domestic bliss with the people I need right now. I could function like the average person. I could get a job, maybe even go back to college at some point. But then reality comes back, and I realize that life isn't that simple. I will never have that perfect dream where I'm ""normal"". I will never have a fairytale ending and I will never be content. The reality that my mental illness does not go away is just too much to handle. I no longer care to get better, because I know that there is no fixing this.

Everyday,"I used to only have suicidal thoughts occasionally but I’ve gotten to where I have them every single day now. I have them at home. I have them at work sometimes. 

I’m definitely in the second worst depression of my life right now. (The first was when my mom passed away.) I’m not in any immediate danger to myself. I would never act on it because it would hurt my friends and I have pets that rely on me. But life is just so f***ing hard for me right now and I feel like a huge burden unloading it on my friends. 

The majority of the time I wish I didn’t exist. I’ve been struggling with depression for 16 years now. No medicines work for me because they always give me dangerous side affects. (I’ve tried nearly every med under the sun.) Therapy is alright but I can never stick with the things I learn or often forget them. 

On top of the depression, I have anxiety and it’s completely crippled me. I second guess myself constantly at work even though I know I’m good at what I do. I don’t reach out to friends because I feel like a bother. The anxiety has made me into a paranoid little baby. 

I don’t do things I used to enjoy because I just don’t feel joy anymore. I feel like my brain is completely broken and I don’t have the will to try feeling anything else besides anger or sadness anymore. I just give in to the sadness or constantly dissociate.

School is already a living hell. I can’t do this anymore,"I’m young, real young. I turned 15 this week. I myself can admit, I’m a bit weird. I’ve been diagnosed with moderate adhd these past two or so years, so that confirmed what was so different from the other students.

At this point I’m fucking stuck, jammed like a stone in cogs and gears. I’m in a toxic friendship, so toxic I’d die from radiation before I jump off some nearby cliffs.

Let me explain. There’s this one guy, he’s taller than my whole friend group, (I’m the second tallest so I’m not the short stack) he constantly has relationships which only last half a month cause I myself know that he’s a dick to everyone. He’s such a fucking narcissistic shitbag that he puts himself ahead of others, steals my credit and isn’t afraid to smack me on the back or neck hard when I make a small mistake. I’m sensitive too, and I can’t do jack shit about it, so the smallest insult now is like a blade in my chest, though I hide it to not look like a pussy. He can insult you but you can’t say anything to him, he cursed on my mother and grandmother which was sick at the time and he knew this would hurt me.

By now you’re saying, well? Leave this guy he’s a bad influence. No. It’s not that easy, I leave this guy and all his sheep (actually good friends to me) will turn against me. Not because they want. Because they’re scared that he’ll give them a beating or he’ll dehumanize them like he did to me many times.

This has been going on for a year. I still have straight a’s and some b’s but I’m doing homework 30 minutes before class or at 4:00am because I purposely take my adhd medication which can keep you up as it’s a mental stimulant. I haven’t slept in 5 days because of this, I’m not addicted or overdosing as I am keeping the 3 pills daily in mind.

Still remember being told my art aspirations are hopeless.,"Was said to me by my mom too. The sentence still rings in my mind, not because of how much it irritates me but because of how inherently true it is. And not long before that, she also felt the need to tell me directly that she doesn't care about how I feel, nor if I hurt myself. Thanks for supporting me, mom.

After already struggling with a potent and vicious envy, tormenting and tearing me apart from the inside out that nobody besides myself can comprehend the degree of, I've reached a breaking point beyond what I've felt before. Living life, unable to stop thinking of someone who feels the exact same, just better.

Disturbingly similar attributes, ideas, and one particular concept. A concept they executed first, because unlike me, they're smart, and put their years of childhood into crafting something awe inspiring, something I should've done by now. It all perfectly lines up and enunciates all of my shortcomings. Constant crying, nightmares, panic attacks, and many points of a gun to my head. I'm nineteen, and they're a year younger than I am, which really tells how close I was.

All of these desires and concepts, too bad they were stuck in a frangible brain like mine so I could only watch everyone similar sprout and bloom into something significant and prodigious. Something I should have done. Unfortunately, I clearly wasn't meant to accomplish any of that.

So I've tried drawing boxes, and figures, but in the end, I know better. How it'll take years of struggling with this before anything I create even resembles anything I want it to be. I don't have the willpower to do it, nothing to overcome my feelings of valuelessness.

I've just wanted to impress people. Endlessly feeling boring and disposable takes a toll on you, especially when you see other people very similar to you shining like stars. And this means there's technically no more passion in me. Passion is the heart and soul in the concept of art.

So there it is. I'm not capable of true art. I can't comprehend true art.

Sure, whatever may be unique about me will die with me before any of it could come out. But you know what? There's a lot of people out there who do it better. There are people who's unique ideas are more intuitive and inspiring than mine are.

The artist I envy has executed concepts and ideas with disturbingly strong similarities to my own, just better, and there are many alike him as well. So if people would like whatever is unique about me so damn much, they can just go to that fucking artist instead. The one who didn't fuck everything up. The one who could handle the hardships he was dealt. I'm done with it all.

Sorry for wasting your time by reading this,"This summer I'm gonna hit 30 and I'm done. I can't see any reason for me to continue living. I've been through so much shit already.. I can't even tell you my whole life story because my fingers would probably die from typing. Just some examples: -Grounded by family when I was 18yo, because I defended my mom against my alcoholic father, but at the end she ended up on his side. That day he kicked me out of the house I've never been there. 12 years 
-Ended up on the street, totally broken by betrayal by those who should love you forever no matter what. Because I was homeless I couldn't finish high school and all of my friends turned their back on me instead of helping. 
-I was over 6 years sleeping on the street, looting food from garbage etc. 
-Sometimes when I was hungry af, I was stealing food from shops. For this I've been charged 2 years in prison. 

Way more bad things happened, but those are the most cruelest things that simply broke me down. 

For 11 years I blamed myself that it's my mistake that my family just abandoned me, the way I lived was for me something like punishment. I was on purpose hurting myself by this lifestyle, because I thought I don't deserve better life. 

Somehow I managed to get a nice job, I'm paying my debt for health insurance, court charges etc. I have roof over my head in Salvation army asylum, paying for a room with 2 beds. And it looks like that finally I can have a normal life. 

The problem is that I can't see a reason why should I even try it. I can't find any sort of motivation, trust me I'm thinking about it 24/7. Why should I continue slowly getting my life back together if I'm so lonely. It's impossible for me to make friends because of my trust issues. I'm actually trying to meet some people and getting to contact with them. But I just can't trust anyone and after any kind of misbehaviour from them (lying, forgetting thins etc) I'm cutting them off forever. I'm not able to forgive. 

Why should I even continue in this shit. It's so easy to  end it. It's pointless for me to struggle by putting my shot together if I don't have any motivation. Better life? I don't care, since I was homeless for such a long time I can go back to this lifestyle faster then you blink. 

I'm so tired, sad, frustrated and angry. Tell me why shouldn't I just hang myself on the 1st tree. What is the point of fixing my life if I can't even figure out what I would like to do.

What did I do wrong,"For years I’ve struggled with body image, confidence, social life, and something that has always had a large impact on my mental state is seeing other people who never see this side of people, who have a healthy relationship, who cares about their own safety, and who has found their path in life. 

For a while I thought I had found my path, but for some reason I find myself becoming more and more curious, sometimes giving in to intrusive thoughts. I haven’t yet planned a suicide, but for a long time I’ve firmly believed I peaked in hs, and that I won’t live to see my 30s. I totaled my car last year, and I honestly don’t care. It was expensive, and I straight up don’t give a fuck. I bought a motorcycle because that’s always been a small passion in my otherwise useless life, and now I ride recklessly because I figure I’ll either get there faster l, or I’ll die trying And my family won’t feel guilty. It works out perfectly, and yet here I am.

Feeling moving closer to the edge.,"22 M , Unemployed, Crippling drug addiction to benzodiapines as a result of my panic attacks. I dont feel anything anymore. Im just numb all the time, I wanna cry so badly but I cant an idk why. I've been this way since 8th grade when a girl rejected me and my life stopped faster than a kamakazi pilot. I know, I already sound fucking pathetic but please let me explain. I am a pathetic loser but have you ever looked at someone you have no idea who they are and you just fall head over heels for them. That was me, except my crush was a nerdy book type that kept to herself and was always quiet. I dont know why and I cant explain it, I know how fucking stupid it sounds but I was a socially dumb kid. My parents pulled me out of school alot and I never got to have a 'normal' childhood. Years later I've achieved nothing but ruin my GABA receptors and smoked pot. I dont care or want  a relationship. I just want to die since knowing I will never have a family or kids. I will never have a intimate relationship. I will never be successful or achieve my dreams. Yet im too much of a pussy ass coward to take my own life, I told my mother ""I dont care if I die or end up in jail or homeless"" and she said Good for you. So there's my family dynamics.

- panic attacks daily. 
- barely eating and I can't get myself to get groceries
-self harming

Attempted last week,"March 13th I tried to OD, I had a problem with alcohol, and unfortunately cheated on my (ex) bf while blacked out (not looking for comments on this). 
I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for over 10years.

Actually seeing how much of a POS I am set me off. I want out of life due to shame, guilt and how much I absolutely fucking hate myself for being scum and not being able to stand my ground and say no like I wanted too. I hurt someone I was supposed to spend my life with, my childrens stepfather is gone. I ruined 4 life's.

 I ended up in the hospital for 4 days, and I'm now on Wellbutrin.

I'm home, doing well on the pills. I don't regret trying to die, I wish it worked because I still can't look in the mirror, I'm disgusting, I hate myself. 

The only thing keeping me going is work and my kids.

After getting home from the hospital, the kids were immediately dropped off by their father (he had them when I attempted, i was alone at home and he called me while i was starting to pass out and he called 911), and I have had no one offer help or ask how I'm doing.

No one has said they're glad I'm alive.

I know my kids are, but they have a huge support system on their dad's side.

It just hurts seeing how alone I actually am.

No one has said they're happy it didn't work.

My story,"Hi my name's David and I'm here because I lost my girlfriend last year and I have never been so sad and lost in despair in my life. My mom killed herself 5 years ago, then I lost my son, then I met the most beautiful and amazing woman on earth, and then she died. I abandoned my job, and relapsed on heroin and fentanyl after years of being clean. I overdosed many times and I didn't care for my life anymore and wanted to die. One night I sat in my friends living room with his gun in my hand and thought about it for too long. He got home and took the gun away. Another time I overdosed and stopped breathing for 5 minutes and my friends daughter brought me back. I yelled at her and everybody else for saving my life and told them to push me out of the car somewhere next time. Anyway, my girlfriend has a daughter who is only 10 years old and I have never met her but she is the reason I stopped trying to die. I'm a union carpenter and I make enough money to really help her by investing in her future, so I have decided to stay alive and make money so I can save it all for her, now that her mom can't. That's why I got clean again 3 months ago and stopped trying to kill myself. Anyway, I still hate my life and I don't want to be here anymore. I'm so sad all the time and I cry myself to sleep almost every night.

I’ve been missing extreme amounts of school (including early pick ups) and one day she snapped on me to tell her what’s wrong. I told her that I genuinely can’t tell her not because it’s about my trauma (she knows who my rapist is) but because everything as built up so far to the point where I don’t know what’s wrong I just know everything is wrong. While we where in the car she said “I feel so sick at work not knowing when I’m going to get the next call that *Im feeling suicidal*” I just want to know if there’s something I can do.

"I feel like at some point in my life, I’m gonna kill myself.","I’ve been super depressed this year, sure, but I don’t think it’s gonna come yet. I remember when I was young, when Robin Williams killed himself it really shook me because like, I understood. Like my response wasn’t being sad necessarily, it was “well, I get it.”

It’s weird, I don’t know, I almost don’t even feel emotional saying this. One time a couple weeks ago, I was smoking weed and my heart kind of skipped a beat in a weird way, and I thought “good.” I was like, “this would be an easy way to solve everything,” like it would be a relief to die then and there. People don’t think that, right? That’s weird that I thought that?

Why don’t I fantasize about good things anymore? Why don’t I have Oscar acceptance speeches in my mirror? Why don’t I think about my dream girl? All I ever think about is how hard it’ll be to get where I want to be, and how I’ll probably be 38 when I meet the LOML and I’ll have no time to do anything fun with her anyway. All I ever imagine is the bad stuff.

I think if you told me that there was some kind of afterlife, that some religion was right, I’d do a little research to know what to expect and then probably jump out a window. It just makes sense, right? Like what am I living for here?

Yeah yeah I have friends and family that love me, cool. But is that really what’s keeping me here? Guilt? That’s not a great reason for living!

And then it just gets me, it’s like… am I gonna work for another decade before I can get to a place I wanna be? Am I gonna be going on 40 by the time I’m actually feeling progress? In the meantime what the heck happens? Am I just sad and hurt all the time? Not worth it.

I been molested at childhood many times that affected my personality forever, i got builled the entire school and even outside school, literally my entire life because im just a joke and nothing than a burden, Every action i do i do it wrong and end up embarrassed from it, no one gives me a single responsibility because i will fuck it.

No friends either, they all got away even my best friend for 6 years left me without caring because im so fucking boring and I'm introvert, girls avoid me and telling jokes about me, i believe my mind is beyond fucked and can't be repaired in any way, my personality is weak with zero confident, everyone ghost me when i talk with them
Peoples hurt me so much and continuing to do so.

I'm weak physically short and slim, and emotionally weak, no one even take me seriously and i can't change i tried but no success and the future is even darker, hope is nothing but morphine to me.

And much more permanent problems, that's it im done from living in worry, fear and shame everyday, can't walk outside without a hell worries, im sorry i give up, im sorry mom you loved me so much, im sorry dad that i will disappoint you but no worries i will leave you sweet and warm note expressing my love.

I will just throw myself from the bridge into the river near my town within two weeks, no one will be around and i don't know how to swim so once jump it's game over and will finally have my peace from this madness, im sorry river, you don't have to feel bad because i will die in you it's not your fault.

I am so f*cking angry rn,"Soooo, mother's day is coming up and I just had a big focking argument with her (step mom, but that's another story) and I don't think I've ever been so focking angry and upset. None of them know I sh and none of them know how focking close to the edge I am, I want to kill myself sooo focking much because she's such a cunt. But I also don't want to leave my dad, or my brother, or my cat. I also don't want my birth mom to be disappointed in me (she's dead and I hate religion so much but I'm still scared of seeing her in any sort of afterlife and her being disappointed in me). But my focking god, I'm so upset. I'm just sat here, slowly getting more drunk, wishing I had the bollocks to kill myself. But I don't, which make me hate myself even more. I'll probably sh tonight though cause of our completely focking, unimportant, menial focking argument, but she just has to be such a cunt. She absolutely HAS to to find a problem with absolutely focking everything. But the absolute worst part of it is that I don't want to hate her. I love her so focking much but she's such a cunt. She provided me with a mother figure where I wouldn't have had one (potentially) my whole childhood. But I absolutely focking hate her at the same time. My brother has always had issues with her because he was older and he saw her as both who she actually is and he also saw her as trying to replace his mom. I was too young for that point of view but now, I'm 20 and I absolutely see how much of a cunt she is. I love my dad more that pretty much anything in the universe and I'm so scared that she's draining him. Making him doubt and judge himself when he is such an absolutely focking amazing person. But again, she helped him so much when my mom died, when he was vulnerable and in need of help. So for that reason, among others, I can't completely hate that selfish, cruel, ignorant bitch.

I'm so, so, sorry for the language and for potentially triggering people. Also for potentially sounding like a spoilt cunt, but I really had to vent. If I can, I'll mark it as nsfw, because of the language. I'm also sorry for the grammar, if it is incorrect, I'm a bit of a grammar Nazi when sobber, so I hate reading back sober and seeing mistakes.

As a disclaimer, I appreciate anyone and everyone who may comment to support me. However, I am terrible at talking/replying to people. I have pretty much pushed every single one of my friends away because I can't bring myself to reply to them, asking where I've been or if I'm ok. I don't want to drag them down with how much I hate absolutely everything about myself and it's the same with you guys.

"I told myself I would never live to be 18, and my birthday is next month","When I started really feeling depressed for the first time, when I was maybe 13, I told myself I couldn't die yet- wait until you're 14. Wait until you're 15. Have your first kiss first. Learn to drive first. Get your first job. Etc. None of those ever happened, except for me aging.

I feel like the past five years have been nothing but a blur, full of trauma and hurt and change and isolation. I became both homeschooled and homeless (the first time) as soon as 7th grade ended, and since then it's been pure chaos.

I'm going to be 18 fucking years old, but I feel perpetually stuck in time. I haven't had my first kiss yet, let alone a single friend since middle school. I don't know how to drive, since no one will teach me. I can't get a job. My education is fucked. I don't know who I am or what I like or what I want to do in life, and yet in a month I'll be a legal adult, and a month after that, I ""graduate"" high school. I feel too broken for this. I feel too broken to be alive. I'm sad. I'm not funny, or fun to be around. I'm stupid. I'm weird. I used to be outgoing and enthusiastic, with big dreams and good grades. I used to be so sure of myself, so sure I'd go to a good college and have good friends, that I'd have a good life despite my fucked up childhood. Now I feel like a hollow tree.

I've tried twice before. Once when I was 15, and once in December. It obviously didn't work either time. But three is a good number, right? Three is a final number. ""If it happens once, it'll never happen again, but if it happens twice, it will surely happen a third time."" Maybe I *won't* live to be 18. I always get insanely suicidal around my birthday, and I guess it's just early this year. The first two times, I tried to overdose, but this time, I have access to a gun, and a gun doesn't fail. It feels fucked to go out the same way as my uncle, and my uncle's uncle, but I just don't think I can do this. Maybe my family is cursed or something. I don't want to hurt my family, or leave them to deal with me alongside everything else going on, but I feel like I'm an explosion waiting to happen no matter what. I don't want to always be the sad brother, or the sad son, that no one knows what to do with.

Finally accepting that I am not meant for this life,"I have always been afraid of death, but now I'm accepting my own mortality and I have come to the conclusion that if I'm going to die anyway, then there is no point in suffering. There was only a group of people that I've related to in my entire life and everyone in that group despises and mocks me. The few friends that I have had over the years no longer talk with me and I don't know how to talk with them because I don't know how to talk with anyone.

It's been years of hoping for things to get better only to be disappointed and I realized that as long as I am me, I can't be happy.

New here,"Found this subreddit today while searching for suicide methods. It’s interesting finding a place where so many posts are so relatable. I’ve never told anyone about my suicidal thoughts before so I’m just gonna type some random things that I’ve never been able to share with anyone else. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts every now and then starting around high school. Some days after class I would go up to the rooftop of our 8 story apartment and try to jump down, only thing stopping me was the fear of surviving it. And even until now in my early twenties I often think about buying a gun or maybe burn coal in the bathroom or start a generator in my car. Recently saw the trailer for Girl from Plainville and I wish I had a girlfriend like that to push me and give me the courage to do it. 

And honestly I don’t know why suicide is seen as such a bad thing. I’m just trying to find ways to peacefully end my life and all google can show me is the hotline phone number. They’d really rather me do a bad suicide attempt and potentially become a vegetable than just die. The only method that seems 100% to me is shotgun to the head cause I’ve seen a video  and no way is anyone surviving that. But other than that I’ve seen stories of people surviving jumps or hangs or CO poisoning or even pistol to the head.

I never bothered to tell my parents cause they would just say I’m lucky to be born healthy and not have financial problems, so don’t think about that cause other people have it worse. And I know that, I am lucky. But life to me is just enduring one day after another. There’s a saying that goes “life is not to be endured but enjoyed.” Yea that’s freaking bs. I don’t have anything to look forward to. The thought of other people enjoying life makes me jealous. I wish I loved traveling cause people look so happy traveling. I’ve traveled before to some different countries and not that it’s bad but it’s not something I’m willing to work everyday for. Yet I still work cause I’m a coward and don’t have to guts to do it yet.

Anyone else find it so fucking annoying when your brain just jumps to suicide.,What’s up with something mildly annoying me and it makes me wanna die. Or even make a comment like “this shit makes me want to kill myself” obviously I wouldn’t say that but that phrase comes up constantly in my head. I cringe at something stupid it’s suicide. Something is to loud ope wanna die. Something tastes bad I wanna die. And the funny thing is it’s not an actual desire at those points I genuinely don’t want to die I don’t want to hurt myself.

I need help,"This post won't stay on for long, because I'm too paranoid someone will find it even anonymously. 

I had a call from my psychiatrist today for an assessment he thinks I have a depressive disorder with displays of emotionally unstable personality disorder, I am not diagnosed with the latter. 

I'm sat wide awake again feeling rubbish over everything again. I am overthinking everything, I feel my partner will leave me because they're having a rough time. And I hate myself even more, they've been open about having a rough time and I'm being selfish thinking it's because of me/they re going to leave me. 

I'm too paranoid to go into too much detail about my life but it's not great, they're aspects that look promising but it feels like every month I have these fucking spirals where I panic, nothing matters anymore and I should not be here. 

I really just feel like I should not be here, I'm trying really hard to suck up my problems and be there for my closest person when they need me but I'm also hating myself and feeling I'm not good enough and making their life worse right now. 

I self harm usually, I have not done this for a while but now I just cry all the time out of frustration. Now it is nearly 4 am writing this and I have work in 4 hours, I'm so tired but stuck awake.

it may come as a surprise but there are things in life i wanted to be and wanted to do. so so much more than this. it just never really got easier for me. every day i put my life and my death on hold. i tell myself daily for as long as i can remember “tomorrow will be better” “i can change” “things will change”. but it never changes. it has only gotten worse. my life is not a rollercoaster but more like the super shot. just a fast, jolting drop down. except there’s no real end. just a never ending fall, legs in the air and heart in my throat.

It’s always been there…,"Since I was 15 (now I’m 24) I have romanticised my suicide. Not because I wanted people to be at my funeral crying or anything. I wish I genuinely had no one that cared about me so I could die and not destroy anyone’s life because of my actions. 
My first attempt was when I was 19. I swallowed a cocktail of pills and woke up in the hospital and was out of it for days. When I was 20 I was in the middle of a traumatic situation with my ex boyfriend and decided to reach for a blade and take a bath. Before I jumped in the bath I tested the blade and it left a big enough mark to scare me. I needed stitches. I was in and out of psychologists from 15-22. But life started going really well…
I was studying medicine, exercising daily, eating healthy, spending time with good friends. I was like this ‘perfect’ girl. But there always that thought that I would take my own life. Except over the last 2 years I was thinking “oh Ill wait until I’m at least 30 or maybe 40. Life is pretty good right now”. I left my degree due to a lack of passion, I sunk into a mild depression. I began self harming again. I’ve been having issues with my friendships. I feel unappreciated and unworthy (I understand that’s the depression talking). I’m not really religious but on the 5th of January I asked God/Universe/Higher Power (whatever) to show me one small reason to keep going. Just one good thing before the 30th January. If not, I’m done. A few small good things happened. Life was looking up but as soon as February came around, it went downhill. Now (late March) I can’t get out of bed. I’ve tried to get help. But I can’t stop myself from fantasising about my death which I have planned for the next couple of weeks. There is a huge part of me that wants to live. It’s like a tug o’ war. But I’ve committed to the fact that on a specific date in April, I’m out. I’m calm. I feel slightly peaceful except for a raging headache. I’m starting to detach myself from my surroundings. It feels the same as when I was 19…that night I wasn’t even sad. I knew things could get better but I had made a promise myself to go through with it. I know no one can save me and that I just help myself but does someone have any ideas of things that I could do that could change my life and let me live?",Ancient-Soup2098,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tngfym/its_always_been_there/
This world is cruel,"I don’t really know how to start these things off but I am a 21 y/o F, I will be 22 this year. I have been suffering from depression for 13 years since a young age and it’s all been so real and vivid and painful. I think i became awoke/aware of things around 4 when I saw my father try to kill my mom. Which was the beginning of me being conscious and aware of everything in the perception a 3rd person adult would see things, as if they where an outside observer watching crazy shit happen and think that will never be me . but this caused depression because I had no control over the things in my life. 

Which I had made it my life goal to be in control of my life and work hard for the things I want. But as I grew up watching more and more fucked up shit happen in my family and realized how it negatively impacted me causing mental illness(bpd, depression and adhd) it became harder and harder for me to deal with it. I have had multiple attempts through my teen years trying to find an emergency door but always failed. Drugs only numbed the pain till I had to come back to reality and deal with shit. And then I got sober after I tried shrooms and felt a sense of life I hadn’t felt in years around 18. I was motivated and worked so hard to where I am right now, but I am still dealing with new trauma from my family that has severely affected me, my siblings, my mother and my relationship with my significant other for the last 2 years. I am so tired and I know I have so many things to be grateful for in life, and that life is beautiful and that I am strong but I am so so tired. I just want it all to stop moving it’s moving been so fast and I don’t feel like I can keep up with it all. And I don’t express my feelings because I try to be strong for everybody else around me but when it comes out I just can’t control it. I’ve always felt like this. I just ignore it everyday and hope one day I don’t have to ignore it. But I would much rather give everything up at this point and roll the dice of life and see where it ends up. But with that being said if I fail Like I did previous times I will lose everything. My awesome job, I’ll be even more alone and even more depressed that I fucked up and then hate myself even more.

Trying to be a good person can ruin your life.,"If I just had the courage to get mad at my toxic friends and cut them out of my life when I was a teen then I wouldn't be friendless right now. If I did it, they would get humiliated for being bad people and make the classroom awkard for us but it would've made my life better.

If I just had the courage to speak up and scream at my father  for ruining the family, wasting money, and being neglectful then I wouldn't be so useless right now for not having developed my skills when I was younger. If I did it, he would've abused me even more and possibly killed my mother because he's not the type to listen but it was just a big risk that I didn't take.

If I hadn't been such a good kid and just cursed a lot then I would've gotten much more personality right now. I'm already an adult but I still can't do it because I swore to never  swear in real life(I am comfortable swearing online) when I was a teen and I just don't feel comfortable doing it now.

I'm at my wits end and I dont know if I can take the stress of being this big of a fuck up. I'm just ready to take an entire bottle of concerta and die.",anonymous-9999999,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnfnps/my_sexuality_has_been_stressing_me_out/

me living is no longer a priority,"the only person i've ever truly confided in about my suicidal feelings was my mom. over the past 6 months, she has developed steadily progressing dementia that makes it nearly impossible for her to understand speech or speak herself. she was the only one who could have ever gotten help for me.
now the rest of my family is tasked with taking care of her as she loses the ability to live day-to-day and they don't have time or patience to deal with my depressed bullshit the way that she did. they dont care that i want to die because she is actively dying before our eyes. part of me thinks i should kill myself quick so i dont have to see her go, part of me thinks i should wait a few months until she forgets who i am and she wont miss me once im gone.",raisinthusiast,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnfj6d/me_living_is_no_longer_a_priority/
I’m more suicidal than I’ve ever been.,"It’s terrifying. I’ve always struggled with dark thoughts and some form of depression, but lately I’ve noticed it’s gotten much, much worse. It’s weird, as I’m arguably in a better social place now than I was back then. I have close friends, who I can turn to and who will listen to me. I have support available, so why do I feel even worse than before? Why do I want to off myself even more than I did before? Why has it gone from maybe once a week if that to daily wishes to die? 

It’s all exhausting, and more than ever, I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up.",56ThrowawayAccount56,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tnfj0y/im_more_suicidal_than_ive_ever_been/
I wish people would just let me kill myself already,"In advance, I’m sorry if this comes off as extremely selfish and hateful. It’s just I’m so hurt and alone and I’ve been betrayed and abused by so many people that I just have a strong aversion towards the human race (my hatred for humans is so deep that I’d really rather not discuss the details of it, trust me, they’re bad), and please don’t say that “you are a human, too”. Yes, I’m aware. That doesn’t mean I associate myself with the rest of the human race, though. Anyway, this is really just a vent. I don’t expect any advice or anything, but if you do, I highly appreciate it, and thank you in advance.

I’m so sick of people calling suicide “selfish”. The people who say this are the same people that constantly invalidate me and tell me to “get over” my problems. I’ve been through too much, I’m tired of it already. I don’t see any value in my life whatsoever, why can’t people just grasp that?

Im aware that by succeeding, it’ll affect my family, but I really wish they’d understand that I’m literally MISERABLE, and I’d be doing both them and myself a favor by killing myself. Maybe life isn’t worthless in *your* mind, but I’m literally **suffering** just from the fact that I still have to wake up every morning, realizing that I’m still here and that it’s just another day of reluctantly pleasing the human race with my general presence. I HATE this cruel, vile world! I’ve had enough with the dickheadery. I don’t want to be associated with this world anymore. I’m sick of forcing myself to continue living just to please others, while it’s making me 10x more miserable in the process, like don’t you realize it’s literally **crippling** me having to realize I’m still alive? This curse has gone on for too long. I’m OVER IT! It’s not a hard concept to understand!

I feel like I’m forced to believe in these bullcrap “you’re so strong” narratives when it comes to my trauma and I feel like I’m only alive just to please my family. I feel like I’m living for them and not myself. I feel like I’m forced to stay alive because I keep believing people when they say that life actually gets better, but nope it just gets worse and worse (just recently, my bf sexually assaulted me AGAIN in my sleep. Yep, sounds like it’s getting sooooo much better, amirite?). I keep falling into the dumb “life gets better” trap, and I just want out already. 

Abuse didn’t make me strong just cause I’m miraculously still alive. It’s just another bullshit excuse for others to fake-care about me and get me to switch subjects so they don’t suffer the consequences of being uncomfortable. In fact, the trauma has made me weaker than ever. I can’t get out of bed. I barely bathe and brush my teeth cause I simply can’t get myself to do it unless I literally **force** myself to do it (like threatening self-harm or suicide in my head to trick my brain into becoming active). I’ve been struggling with eating disorders due to the constant trauma, and now I’m fat. I’m on-and-off with the self-harm. I’m craving a sharp knife against my skin as I’m typing this. I’m tired of work, and I’ll never become a professional illustrator, which was my biggest dream in life. I’m sick of *me* having to do all the hard, painful work to heal because *other people* have cause me to be in the rabbit hole I’m in right now. I’d much rather numb the pain with lots of weed and alcohol and call it a day. Better than waiting for an outcome that will probably never happen.

Honestly, I  don’t see myself living past 21, and my 21st birthday is in less than 4 months. I honestly don’t know if I can force myself to live up to that milestone. Im not sure I can even last another week here. I’m tired of forcing myself to live just because other people have a problem with me dying. I’m tired of dragging myself into psychiatrist/therapy sessions I don’t want to go to because I know they’re gonna invalidate me and hit me with that same “you have to work for it”, don’t you think I’m trying? I’ve been trying for the past 7 years with literally *nothing* changing and things only getting worse as each day passes. Whether or not I wanna and actually do commit suicide is MY business and MY choice, goddammit!

I hadn't had any thoughts of self-harm until this week, which I think may have been one of if not the worst of my 19 years on this earth. I can't even grieve over the loss of my dog who was one of the closest things I had to a way to take my mind off stuff and that I loved with every ounce of my body, I didn't feel anything It feels like the hole in my heart had just been torn even bigger after coming home to her not being around anymore without even a last goodbye. On the same day, the girl I have endless love for that has been one of the first people in my life to show me genuine love and care, decided that it wasn't meant to be between us and that she had found a new guy that she wants to try new things with, I don't even understand what I felt. How do I lose the only two girls and things I loved on this planet on the same day. I can't even understand what I could have done wrong to deserve something like this to happen to me on the same day. I haven't been able to eat and barely sleeping it feels like I can't even talk to anyone about it because I'm a guy, I can't get help from anyone because I have always pushed these emotions down so it seems like I'm always happy, I don't know what to do, I'm scared of what I am going to do to myself.

on being depressed with a passion for life,"Most days are anxiety-inducing. I spend the majority of my life in my bed. No job, struggling to complete my coursework, or even just to take a shower.

As of the last year, these days that I have struggled with since I was ten, have become many and far in between. I wake up dreading the fear that the day will bring, the arguments, the pain, and the inevitability of my own suicide. I know one day the suffering will be too much to bear and without doubt, I will hurt many people. I have felt for months that day is getting closer than ever.

A few days, when the arguments subside and I feel a little more hopeful about where my life is going, I am filled with a passion and love for everything about life that I hate. I want to strive to get a job, get my license, succeed in college again, reach out to people, and take care of myself in ways that I can't bear to do usually. I still have hope. I crave to escape the hole that I am in, but it feels inescapable. Whenever I try to turn my life into something more positive I am met with another detrimental setback that puts me at square one all over again. It makes me fear being happy because I know those periods will only last a few days at most.

I feel so desperate to not feel miserable. I really don't want to die but I am sick of this cycle. I see other people so content, in loving relationships with families and I crave it so badly.

I'm now insecure of the only thing that I liked about myself. I don't want to live anymore.,"I don't like anything about myself. My weight (BDD), my face, my feet, everything. Everything but one thing, my hair. When I was younger, it grew over my eyes a lot because I couldn't get it cut, but it ended up comforting me because of the trauma I was going through at the moment. Now, it's covering my eyes. I know that others don't like it much, but me and my friends like it, so that's all that matters, right? Well, I am horribly insecure about my face and I wear a face mask as well (I can't even take it off to eat sometimes) so my face is unseen. My hair wasn't looking the best today and my day was pretty shitty. I was out with my family and it was constant nagging from all of them, my mom wanting my hair out of my face while my little sister wanted to go home. I just wanted to have fun. That caused me to not be able to fix my hair, which I'm assuming looked shitty, but it was still covering my eyes and that's all that matters, right? Well, long story short, my hair was called atrocious by someone who wasn't even trying to hurt me. I was informed of it by someone and it hurt. I have no will to live now. I hate my hair and am insecure of it now. Now it's only my mask that brings me comfort. I don't want to live. I actually have something planned for tonight or later, but if I survive the attempt, how will my family think of me? It's a 50/50 chance that I'm willing to take and if anything, the only thing stopping me is the fear of failure, not death. I'm not scared to die. If anything, I want to die, looking like this. I don't want to be scolded for trying to die and don't know what to do. I don't have one will to live, just a fear that I'll be yelled at if I survive. I might do it tonight, but I'm not sure.

I feel like a doll.,"I have had anxiety all my life. I finally took some medication to help it, and it did. However, I have come to realizations because of this. I have social anxiety. And when I meet people, they tend to be off put by me, no matter how I talk, look, or present myself. I've tried everything. After my anxiety got progressively better, I realized that even with my anxiety gone, my interactions with people are still the same. They don't like me. It's not something I've fabricated in my mind. I feel their pity and frustration when they talk to me.

But onto my main point. I am a female, and other females don't like me. Males do, however, but they only like me for sex. Every male friend I've had, every male who's talked to me, wants me for my body. I can say with confidence that I am a very beautiful woman, but it seems as though that's all I have. No one wants to listen to me; they will either leave, ignore me, or want for sex.

I don't even feel that I'm good at performing in bed; to be honest, I don't think I'm good at all. All I do is take, and what I give is never enough. But I try with al my heart, because I know that at the end of the day, that's all I'm good for. It feels ironic given that it is my purpose.

Mind you, I never give out sex and I don't dress as if I want it. I've only done so with my boyfriend.

I am a student in college, and I don't want to do my program. I am learning to work out, and even in that, everything feels so pointless.

Nobody Knows I Think of Suicide Daily,"For starters, I never really had a childhood. When I was 4 my parents would constantly fight and eventually got divorced. At the time I did not really understand and thought that my mom and dad needed space from each other. Well, I never learned that they would never get back together until my dad remarried to a woman with 3 sons all older than me and my younger brother. Now my Stepmother was horrible to me and my brother. This included being locked in the same room with my brother the whole day, one meal per day, a gate in the bedroom doorway so that neither of us could go to the bathroom or get a drink of water. Now I was not always in my room I would go outside sometimes, but I would be locked outside by my stepmother. Whenever I told my father about it he either did not believe me or shrugged it off as a mistake. My mother was not any better than my father. She never remarried but was extremely lazy and never cleaned the house, she also never gave any discipline either so I was free to do whatever I wanted. Then when I was 5 things in my childhood got a lot harder when we found out my younger brother has severe autism.

Now things switched from me getting some attention from my parents to none at all. I was now treated like a second-rate child by almost everyone. Now, whenever it was my birthday and wanted to go somewhere we had to plan it to make sure that my brother would also enjoy going there because if he did not then my birthday would be cut very short. Not on,y that, the presents were even unfair and I know it sounds like I am just being selfish, but is it selfish when on Christmas I would get a $10 lego set and then my brother would get a new keyboard piano that he did not have to share? The only time I ever felt like I was treated equally was when I was over at my Great Aunt/Uncle's house. At their house, I was not treated as a second-rate child, but instead as their own child. They gave me acknowledgment and love when my actual parents did not. They did not change plans because of my brother. They helped fill the void that my mom and dad had left in me. But my Great Uncle would pass away when I was 9 due to cancer. This not only hit me hard, it felt like I had lost my real dad and now I would never get him back. My Great Aunt was still alive and kept up with me, but I would only see her less and less as the years went by.

Preteen/Teenager years were rough for me. And yes I know most people's preteen/teenager years were rough. So for starters remember me talking about being almost locked in my room or having complete freedom depending on what parent I was with? Well, this was not good for me at all as I got no interaction from peers my age and when I did get some it was only for brief moments. SO I never knew how to interact with people. I did make friends, but this was when I started lying to look cool instead of telling people that when I am with my dad I am basically in prison and when I am with my mom I live in a pigpen. This kept leading to lies getting deeper and deeper and eventually developing into pathological lying. It wasn't that I was not kind or anything, I just wanted to be cool and normal like the other kids and my friends. This however was only the tip of the very uneasy iceberg because now people were getting in romantic relationships in high school. And god-forbid that I get a girlfriend during this time...

Well it happened, I got a girlfriend when I was freshman in High school. She was the polar opposite of me where I was shy and not very interactable if I did not know you, she was the party girl who wanted to drink booze and smoke weed. During the times that she did drink or smoke I would feel left out just like with my family at home, so again I made up stories and stuff to make myself look better. Well, now I was getting called out by others for my lies. I knew it was wrong, but for me, it was all about the attention at the time no matter if it was good or bad. It made me feel real and like I mattered in a twisted way. Well now because I was being called out I started to get even more depressed than I was and resorted to self-harm. Eventually, one night when me and my ex were talking she got drunk and started sending messages that I needed to man up and have intercourse with her r she will leave me. Well, me being in a not-so-good position in life I self-harmed more violently that time and sent an image to her in retaliation for her saying that she will leave me. I know, a match made in heaven right there. I will not say that I was not at fault partially in that situation, and I will not defend my actions. I merely wish to vent and talk about this anonymously as I have never spoken about this before to anyone.

After that incident, the next day I was beaten to a pulp by 3 guys who liked my ex and thought doing this would land them brownie points. After which the school district finally did an investigation which involved my ex telling her side and only hearing her side. My friends called me insane and left one by one until I had no friends anymore. What hurt the most from that though was now I was alone, my parents still never really paid attention to me and now were treating me like a chore than a son. Instead of getting me the help, I needed they instead did nothing at all except send me to a psychologist who would proscribe every drug in the world and a therapist who did not really understand what I was saying, and that was I needed help. I relied on them for help and they were never there. Now at this point I'm 16 and have no friends, still don't know how to keep friends, and don't know how to reliably get help. I spent the rest of my high school years in and out of different schools with no friends or girlfriends. I was so shut off that when there was a girl who liked me or someone who wanted to be friends I would always dismiss them or tell them that they could do better than me. I was a husk in my own body and it was all due to my actions and not wanting to open up to anyone. I did get some romantic relationships eventually, but those fell off as I never put the time or effort to make it last. 

When I was 18 I had my first suicide attempt, I failed obviously and I am glad it did at the time. I eventually got in contact with my Great Aunt again after 12 years, we chatted about what had happened in our lives with me tearing up for the first time in a while talking about what my childhood and teen life were like. She told me that she was the same way in that she was suicidal and we connected together because of that morbid fact. She talked me out of many other suicide attempts and kept telling me that it will always et better no matter what. And yes things did get better, I bought a car and paid it off in less than a year, I have grown and learned so much that I am wiser than I was before, and I am going to college to get a degree in biology. And in all honesty, I would not change anything one bit knowing who I am now, but I still get the feeling that everything would be better if I just did not exist.

Now we come to today with me still dealing with suicide. It has now been a constant battle with it daily because I just don't know what to do. I can't get over my past and the mistakes that I made and even then this post does not even cover all of them if it did it would be almost 100 pages at least. I just wish sometimes I never existed in the first place or that I was born to loving parents who actually cared for me instead of sidelining me for my brother because he has autism. I am so full of rage for myself and my brother not because he is autistic but he took away the childhood I needed in the first place. I'm 22 and feel stuck like I don't know where to go from here. I don't know how to move on from the past mistakes that keep me back. I don't know how to look at the future and not see it landing me with the worst life imaginable. And especially I do not know how to get over the feeling of not wanting to exist daily and thinking of ways to die.

Not fully suicidal yet but have been in the past,"TLDR; Suicidal thoughts around being sexless for years and now struggling to attract an amazing person.

So I got sick for a few years and my junk (male organs) became either inactive or just were producing low levels of hormones.

Fast forward to current times and I have put my disease into full remission and lost a ton of weight... in amazing shape from rock climbing 3-4 days per week. My male stuff now works great being on hormone therapy but the inability to attract a new mate is really destroying my self worth. Along side this I am suffering in finances currently and not working/applied to hundreds of jobs and not finding a path that I would want to exist in/or feel like I'm not in prison and can't escape.

The combo of having not had a sexual release and not being touched in an intimate way for years is something that is a first. I used to have sex 1x per month when going out on the weekends or everyday when in most of my committed relationships in the past.

I feel like a jobless loser who can't get my needs met.. Have seen some women interested, but I have been celibate for so long that I have forgotten how to attract someone special. Not even looking for one night stands.. I want a real partner and have low self worth in these couple of areas that is messing with my energy.

Recently went dancing and I messed up in the conversation when asking her to go out to the patio area to talk... Another girl I felt like I had some great rapport with and she kept showing up to my meetups/events but as we are now closer.. she confided that she was completely lesbian.. Still grateful to have her as a friend. Have been ghosted so many times on tinder I lost count but was matching with so many women too because I was wearing decent clothes and have an athletic build.

Was also on multiple dates when my stuff was not working and just didn't have a sex drive to pursue anything at the time.

I was sexually abused by my biological mom as a kid and sure that I have some of that.. that still follows me around. Still maybe it's just that I am so insecure about closing the deal and building attraction that I just sabotage the conversation or need to lighten up my energy a bit.

Don't want to commit suicide but I don't want to go another year as an unf\*\*kable guy. Have some great/effective plans to go which I will not mention.. but I want to live right now.",juggernautica1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tne0i6/not_fully_suicidal_yet_but_have_been_in_the_past/

No one to blame but myself.,"I’ve posted in r/depression before but recently discovered this sub and thought this would be a good place to express how I’m (31 M) feeling. All my life I’ve been manic. I have a large personality, was the class clown, I have a lot of friends and great family but I’ve struggled with substance abuse and getting into trouble all my life. I was more obsessed with partying than actually focusing and making something out of myself. I’ve always had behavioral issues but it wasn’t until I was discharged from the Marine Corps that I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. I take antidepressants and attend therapy but it just hasn’t seemed to make a dent and my alcohol use just never seemed to subside. Every time I’d say that I was never drinking again I would just wind up drinking again a week later. This all culminated into me getting my first DWI two weeks ago and it’s made my depression worse than I could have ever imagined. I was already having trouble getting out of bed everyday but now I wake up wishing I hadn’t and feel nauseous throughout the day as thoughts of how to end my life race through my mind. I’m ashamed, I feel worthless, like I haven’t lived up to my potential, that I’ve fucked myself up so bad that there’s no going back. I’ve put a gun in my mouth before to get the feeling but always pussy out when I think about my family. The only thing that has stopped me from hiking into the woods and pulling the trigger is that I don’t want to leave my wife (who I love more than anything in the world) to pick up the pieces and deal with the fallout. I also can’t imagine leaving her to take care of our amazing dog alone either. Still, it’s becoming harder and harder to drown out the voices in my head.

I guess I’m just posting this to get this off my chest because my therapist just doesn’t seem to be hearing me. I’m wondering how other people keep going day by day and if anyone has found a way to cope with these feelings. I know it’s up to me to pick myself up and fix the issues that I’ve caused but my brain just seems to focus on taking the easy way out. I appreciate each and every one of you in this sub and I really hope that we can collectively help each other.

Very close to losing my battle,"Hi there everyone,

I am writing because I feel like I'm very close to losing my battle. I've struggled with depression, PTSD, and self harm and suicidal thoughts for years. I've had my moments of improvement and I can very much successfully ""mask"" being happy. 

In fact, if you ever met me irl you would probably think I was.

However lately I've been feeling worse and worse. The years go by and I feel either miserable or nothing at all. I really don't know how I can handle doing this forever. I don't want to die because I do have a few people who love me. This is the one thing that keeps me going. 

Again it is getting very hard to keep going. I was thinking of checking into a mental health facility or something. I know absolutely nothing about how this works though. Does anyone have any experience with this and does this work?

"15, Trans Girl, Increasingly Suicidal","I’m only 15, yet I can only see my future ending in my suicide. I have supportive family. I’m at a young age. But it all feels hopeless. My dream is to be a model. Or just, someone pretty. A girl that is pretty. I don’t have that, and don’t think I’ll ever will. I haven’t started hormones or anything, but even working on myself is too hard. I hate how negative I am, and how toxic I am. Even with friends I’m aggressive, and I hate it. If my life doesn’t go on the one path it needs to, I’m ending it. There’s no point. Unhappy with a job I hate, while having to live as an ugly freak. My mother has insurance, so it’s not like surgery is unreachable. I want to work on my face and voice. But I’m so depressed I can’t. I think about suicide every day. Whether it’s with a knife or gun. I suppose it’s good I don’t have a gun, or I wouldn’t be typing this post right now. Anything else would be too painful. But everyday it looks a little less bad. I look in the mirror and think, “hmm…maybe it will work…” but looking at pictures. I’m kidding myself. I only imagine myself with a mask on, literally all day. Except my nose is too big. So I’d have to get surgery to make it smaller and more feminine. I’m already planning on selling of my expensive things, and only keeping my phone to get money. Why couldn’t I have just been born a woman? Nope, be born a male, with an extremely rare condition. 

I’m 5’5, might shrink with hormones. My body is skinny, and not that masculine. I have body hair, but that can be shaved and lasered off.
However, my face and voice is horrible. And most insurances just so conveniently leave out facial feminization surgery and voice therapy. The two most important things for a trans woman. Getting SRS is nice, but it’s not gonna matter if you look and sound look someone completely different. I’m gonna take my sophomore year off and do home schooling, and take that time to do everything in my ability to turn myself into who I want, but I seriously doubt it’ll amount to anything. Why can’t estrogen have such a strong effect like testosterone? It’s all so unfair. Is it punishment? I don’t know.

I often imagine people’s reactions to my death. I get sad because I won’t be able to see it. To see if they would care. I cry looking at other women. I lost a 50/50 chance, but “won” a 1% chance to have this condition. It’s almost funny. I had an issue with self-harm back in 6th grade. For, to this day, I can’t exactly pinpoint why. So many things happened that year. It almost feels as if I’ll maybe go back to it.

I used to be so good academically. Now, while not bad, I’m just a slightly above average student. I don’t get excited about anything. I can’t play video games without getting angry and getting dysphoria, I can’t look or think about women normally or sexually without feeling horrible or like a creep and getting dysphoria, I can’t do ANYTHING that doesn’t remind me of my dysphoria. I want it all to stop. But it won’t. No matter if I’m hormones, I’ll still sob and want to die from trying to look or sound pretty when I’ve already been poisoned.

I have to let my parents know I’m suicidal. It’ll happen eventually, my therapist is obligated to tell them. I already have a brother who had bad suicidal thoughts, and still suffers them. I don’t want to put more burden on them, nor give them an actual child who committed suicide. But, it might be only choice.

I have nothing else. It’s all falling apart. I can’t remember the last time I was truly happy. Somewhere in 7th grade, probably. Before I became deathly apparent of my life. I’m cursed with this. I don’t want to let it win. But, every day, it looks like the only option. I think I have a lot more to say, but I don’t want this to be too long, nor can I remember much else.",Shybabyboo,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tndk6n/15_trans_girl_increasingly_suicidal/

  Do more people recognise themselves in this: I'm just done with my life, I don't enjoy things, I just want peace, I want to leave. Like I have no hope anymore. I always thought; 'keep hope, it gets better, you have to stay for loved ones'.  But it doesn't f*cking get better. Everyday I have to like 'live' while I'm already dead inside. I have to fake smiling, I just have to keep going. For my family and friends, because if I go, I'll break them, I know that, but I'm just done. Staying for my loved ones isn't enough anymore (I know that that sounds so mean). When I wake up, I just want to go back to sleep again, have peace, no pain. I dont want to live like this forever. Sometimes it gets better, but that's only for a little while. Everytime it just gets worse and worse. I dont want that anymore. People like my doctor and best friend want to help me, but I'm at a point where I dont want the help anymore. I think its better for them to just forget about me and let me go, but I know they won't. I know Im Lucky to have loved ones in my life, and I sound so ungrateful for them not being 'enough' anymore, but Im in so much pain. People may think Im selfish for wanting to go, but isn't it selfish from other people to want me to stay?! I don't know how to help myself, I just dont know it anymore.

my mental health teeters on the edge of a knife.,"I'm not doing well at all today.

I'm currently staying at my father's while I look for an open apartment I can afford.
Him and his wife are in the middle of a divorce. And shit is messy. They verbally abuse each other and threaten to kill each other. And she hates me. Literally. She hates all of his children, my siblings. She says things under her breath, just loud enough for me to hear. Knowing I can't do anything about it right now. She giggles and laughs afterwards. 
Just for context. I don't have a room here. I stay on a couch. She kicked my dad out of their bedroom so he just sleeps in the armchair next to me. He's not allowed to be in there. Even though both their names are on the mortgage. He wants to keep the peace. Mainly because of his heart failure. 

But it's hard on me. 
A few months prior my roommate stole $3k from me and got us evicted. I had nowhere to go. I was about to be on the street. Left with no money and no apartment. My dad saved me and let me stay with them. 

I'm always working. Always. I take on as many hours as possible. I don't have privacy. I don't have access to a fridge, stove, or any kind of food storage. 
The only thing I have is my phone and a bag of clothes. 

I want to go back to school and follow my dreams, right? 
It's so hard to stay motivated when it's so bleak.

I woke up at 8am specifically to sit down and make a 2 year plan. For my finances, health, and future. And she whispers loud enough for me to hear: ""Lazy. You are. You're so lazy.""

My mental health is already fragile. I am bipolar II with anxiety disorder and it is a fucking battle to keep my shit in check and just barely function. 

She's called me: ""Lazy, fat, gross, worthless, a child, more I can't remember"" this happens so fucking often. She glares at me and talks about me to my dad.

She purposely makes me feel guilty for eating food that I bought with my own money and makes comments about my weight. 
It's gotten so bad I just eat at work during break and don't eat at their house. 
On my days off it's really bad. I'm so fucking hungry. I've lost 27 pounds in a few months from how drastically my diets changed. 

I can't anymore. I've been staving off my suicidal urges for a long time. I just don't see an end in sight. I'm done. I can't. I'm so tired of fighting. I've been nothing but respectful and kind to her. Tried to be patient. But she's so abusive. :) I want to take some pills and get it over with. I don't have a support system... My siblings can't handle this and I don't think they care. I'm so alone out here. :)

I always have to choose on important stuff and I can't win,"I've been lonely all my teenage years, until I met a girlfriend at 18 to, January 2020. We started dating in May. She is perfect, but I was struggling with gambling addiction since 12. Also, I wanted to study in a different country (I am Russian, wanted to study in Czechia) I planned it with my mother before I met the girl.
I had to leave her In November 2020, betrayed her twice because of my addiction, we broke up after a month of long-distance relationship. I took therapy, I returned home for her and we came together in February 2021, but my mom was very disappointed. She paid for the Education and I just said ""fuck it"" for a girl. I had to chose, and I think it was the right decision for me, but the relationship with my mother is very bad still. In summer 2021 I didn't pass exams as well as I anticipated and so I don't get conscripted my mother decided that I should study abroad again, this time I just returned home, but I had to stay in there for 4 months instead of 1 as I thought, which emotionally drained both of us. Also I got scammed on all my savings (a very dumb accident). We wanted to live together, but couldn't cause I lost all the money. Separation prolonged. Then, as you all now, the war has started and I had to flea. But my gf didn't need to so she didn't. Now after 2 weeks she said that she's tired of this instability and we need to end our relationship, even though she almost explicitly said that she loves me. ATM I have no own money, I am supported by my parents, and if I come back home to her to show that everything I going to be alright I think I will make my relationships with my parents even worse. And what if she wouldn't even agree? I can only doubt, hope and cry. I tired of this bullshit. 2 years of love and things out of my control (mostly) getting in the way, and even when I break through there are always huge consecuenses. Why can't I fucking live normally. Why can't I live with my gf, show my love to her as I want. Why the fuck should COVID and war start when I found the person I want to spend my life with. I don't know. I guess I will somehow have to find the money to buy a ticket home, barely working as a language tutor, making both of my parents angry for a chance for love.

I persistently want to die,"I heard from someone that they have spouts of depression where it becomes ""dangerous"" for them to be around sharp objects or cliffs for example. That they were worried they would kill themselves when they became this way. But I've wanted to be dead for over 7 years, (ever since I was about 12) even at points I will let go of long term goals for instance because I intend on killing myself soon. Throughout most of my grade school from middle to highschool I would do the minimal amount of work because I didn't care about my future. It's like I always want to be dead and not exist but I am not lacking self-control, I want to die painlessly and quickly. At some points I've gotten desperate enough to consider and plan out how I would kill myself. I have plans of how and where I could hang myself, but I haven't quite gotten desperate enough to try it. The reason why is because I know that I would fail were I to try to kill myself with access to my hands. If I had access to euthanasia I would probably do it. Even in my best moments I say, well this won't last, I will put off killing myself for a few days maybe. Or I will just wait until I get depressed again, oh I'll be sad enough to do it soon.. Or when I can't handle things anymore I will just end it. I guess some people would call it lucky that I haven't gotten to that point, but I just find it unfortunate. I put things off and put things off and that is what stops me from killing myself. I put other things off in real life too which has been detrimental to my wellbeing at points, I never get around to doing things.. And well if I ever did then maybe I would just kill myself.

I have tried to kill myself three times in the last three weeks.," For the past three weeks, I have woken up and wondered why I am still alive. In the last three weeks I have tried to kill myself three times. 

The first time I tried to die, I took 32 tablets of ibuprofen or 6400mg. A dangerous dose is 3200mg. I took double that. The second time I tried to die, I took 32 pills of paracetamol, 16000mg. A dangerous amount is 4000mg. I took 4x a lethal dose.

The third time I've tried to die, I took 80 tablets of ibuprofen, 16000mg. A dangerous dose is 3200mg. I took 5x that.

Despite taking several times the lethal dose of ibuprofen/paracetamol, each time I have woke up the next morning and I have felt nothing. I was still alive and I felt no pain anywhere. It felt as though I hadn't even took an overdose the night before. 

Even weeks after this after this has happened I still feel no pain. It doesn't make sense. I shouldn't be alive or at the very least be in some amount of pain, yet I feel perfectly fine.

I am past getting help. All I wanted was to be happy but I cant have this. The damage my parents have done to me over many years cannot be undone. I cannot be happy because I am transgender. The only way I can be happy is to die.

But for some reason I cannot even have this. I cannot function like this in society like this. I have given up trying to be happy.",Raine-x,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tmjds6/i_have_tried_to_kill_myself_three_times_in_the/

hello,"I dont usually per say, talk about this or think about it often. But lately its been hitting me hard, i used to have my family to keep myself together but now i dont really have anyone anymore. I didnt have anyone to talk to about my problems and i still dont. I feel so mentally drained everyday, i only eat once a day or not anymore. I could never ever kill myself but the amount of times i thought about it lately is scaring me so much. I cant even cry anymore, it doesnt lessen my pain like it usually does. It just feels tiring at this point. Thinking of life is so hopeless and tiring, sometimes i feel like i cant go on but i still do because the thought scares me. Im only 16, everyone expects me to be mature. I hate it so much. Why do i have to be perfect to everything? Im only 16. Why is it so wrong that i act immature. why do they make me feel like im the worse person ever when they dont even know what i did for them. Thinking about school made me forget about it for awhile but its been bad enough that i wanted to go here. I never thought i would but im doing this for myself.

Tired,"I’ve been suicidal for almost thirty years and I’m just tired. Spent a lot of time in treatment and therapy only to learn how to keep quiet. I’m on disability and can’t seem to keep a job. I do ok on meds but they’re hard on my body and the only things that work for me are controlled substances so it’s exhausting to deal with. I’ve never had much but manage to lose it all because I grew up homeless and in foster care so I don’t value things the way others do, including relationships. Even my own kids who I love more than anything. I feel like I would be better dead to them than absent and unable to provide. I keep trying to find hobbies but can’t really afford to maintain them. I had to give up my pets, dropped out of college and have basically stopped leaving the house most of the time. I rent and the walls are the same color as the rooms they used to lock me in as a child so I painted them and got in trouble for it. They are making me let them paint over it and I think it’s gonna be the last straw for me. I keep thinking about checking into the hospital but I would literally rather die. I realize it’s the depression talking and if I was on meds maybe I would not feel like this but I just don’t care anymore. I’m tired of being misunderstood when I seek professional help. I’m just tired. My father and grandfather both committed suicide as well. It feels inevitable and I doubt I would have made it this far if it weren’t for people who profit solely from mental illness but don’t genuinely care.

Please read❗️,"Well.. Don’t not know what's happening and why. I've been trying to commit su!c!de since the end of last year. As you can see, it doesn’t seem to work. Every time. So I'm here to explain the reasons for the failed attempts, and to possibly get answers to why this is happening. 

The first time I tried to attempt, was dy!ng of freezing in my room by opening the window completely. (It was winter, snow outside, the weather was freezing cold and the temperature was minus). Before I even got started, there came a terrible and cruel storm and hurricane that hadn’t been in my country since 2013. It lasted for a few weeks. Which we were all forced not to open our windows or drive outside. The storm and hurricane were so strong that most of the trees fell, and all the houses, apartments and buildings shook like crazy. Therefore, I had to postpone. When the storm and hurricane disappeared, the snow melted too, and it got a little warmer. Therefore, I left the freezing method and moved on to the hang!ng method. 

Many of the other attempts were constantly interrupted when my mother, who leaves me the whole day and is in her room because she hates me, slams my door to get in, (She doesn’t even know I'm about to hang myself), and it happens every time and only a few seconds before I plan to jump off the chair. That's why I never get peace to do it. 

I decided to attempt again when she one day leaves the home to buy medicine. She did. And I hurried out to the bathroom, tied a scarf on the curtain rod and hung myself. I stood there hang!ng for about half an hour. I suffered a lot. Without anything happening. Neither unconsciousness nor death. Just pure suffering. (The ensuing symptoms killed me the rest of the day and the days ahead, shit). Then I hopelessly chose to end the experiment. 

Subsequently, I tried to attempt again. Just as I was about to kick the chair away in the bathroom to hang myself, my mom came. She stayed standing by the bathroom trying to get me out. She kept disturbing and wouldn’t go, so I decided to go out. Again, all the times she has neither seen nor known that I would commit su!c!de. 

The last time I tried to hang myself, something scary happened. I went out to the bathroom and wrapped a string around my neck, sat down and waited to be strangled to death. After about 10 seconds, I looked at the toilet. (By the way, the toilet lid was closed. The toilet is like a mirror, you can see everything in front of it). When I looked at the toilet, (still while I sit down and wait for my death), I could suddenly see in the toilet mirror the shadow of an insanely creepy (witch) I guess, with big, round white eyes, long white dress and black, thick, messy hair. Out of fear, I panicked and hurried to tie up the knot, and frightened I rushed out of the bathroom with my heart galloping. It has scared me ever since, which has kept me from trying again. 

The many other attempts at suffocation with plastic bags and swallow pills didn’t work either.

Sorry my long novel, I even tried to make it short. Anyway, what the hell is going on? What was the scary thing I saw in the toilet mirror? Why am I prevented in my attempts every time? What is it, that obviously will not let me d!e?",[deleted],3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tmzk2u/please_read/

"i hate myself , i hate my life","i am 18 and nonbinary. i wish i was a pretty girl or even like a normal dude. i don’t feel comfortable with myself i don’t even know who i am.
my mom is an opioid addict who shits herself and can barely walk without falling over. she’s narcissistic and traumatized me so much throughout my life. she said she’s dying because of me and the stress i put her through.
my dad is a good person. he does everything for us. he has anger issues and screams at me but he does so much for me that it’s ok. he lets my mother treat him like shit and make him sleep on the couch and fund her shopping addiction and bring her things when she can’t walk. 
and me.. im a fucked up dissapointment. I have borderline personality disorder and psychosis and it drives me fucking insane. would you believe it if i said i’ve been to 22 mental hospitals? i started attempting suicide when i was 12 years old. my depression started because my parents would call the cops on me every time i cried.
i loved someone once, dylan. he used me. i was so in love with him, so so in love with him. i did everything for him. i held him while he cried, i stayed with him when he almost died multiple times. but to him i was nothing. i was just a sensitive bitch. all i wanted was to be loved by him. he forced me to have sex with him and he only ever liked me because i reminded him of his ex. the memories of him and how much i liked him and what awful things he did to me haunt me every day.
i have one friend i care about but it doesn’t really feel like he cares all that much and i’m in some sort of relationship with someone but i don’t think they’re enjoying my company all that much. it may be all in my head because of my personality disorder. 
i just wish i could be a child again, and i wish i could have different parents. i wish it would’ve been illegal for mentally ill people to have children so i wouldn’t have been born and cursed with my mothers disgusting illnesses.

My story,"Almost 4 years ago I joined the Navy excited to serve my country and ready to travel the world doing awesome things. After boot camp and ""A"" school I got sent to an aircraft carrier that has been in the shipyard for a little while to go through the RCOH process. Going through this process sailor are pretty much put through one of the lowest points of their lives. We end up stuck in a crappy city, and have to essentially chip paint and then proceed to repaint the same walls for the next four or five years. It is the most demoralizing thing I have ever seen and legitimately makes the sailors feel like they are in prison. Many sailors will try to reach for anything that they can grasp to make it more bearable whether it be drugs, alchohol, or in most cases marrying the first girl they start to date because it makes them feel good. This is the one that I chose. I met my ex 3 years ago after I really started to realize how bad my command was. It was and has been a toxic relationship ever since it started but I was too naive to realize it at the time. A couple months in she moved out and threatened to divorce me because I wouldn't beat up my roomate who argued back when she yelled at him for small things. We made up and she moved back in and I thought things were going fine for a while. Then we found out that she was pregnant which I was extremely ecstatic about because I had an injury in highschool that drastically lowered my chances of ever having my own child. Fast forward through the pregnancy and my daughter is born. The next 4 months were the best of my life, I was obsessed with this little girl and I didn't know that anyone could ever have this much love for such small and fragile human. Then my ex tells me that she might not be mine. She then got a DNA test and it came back that she in fact wasn't mine. Ever since that moment and the last year since it happened I have been devastated. Going through a nasty divorce, stuck in a horrible job, in mountains of debt because of stacking bills, and child support that is almost 30 percent of my check. My parents have told me that it would probably be better if I tried to get my name off the birth certificate and cut ties. While at first I rejected the idea because I still love my daughter like she is my own, I now realize that they have a good point because of how manipulative and toxic her mother has become. I feel like there is barely anything left of me and I feel that if I keep my name that I will become so hollow because all the stress and everything will kill me. But if I do get my name taken off, that the guilt and feeling like I abandoned the lone bright spot in my will be the final straw that makes me kill myself. I feel that no matter what I do will end up with me no longer being able to keep living.",valkyrie5k,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tn7qg4/my_story/

I'm so fucking alone,"No one knows me, so no one can love me (the only people who claim to love me are my parents, but again, they don't know ME) . I really just want to feel loved once in my life, but I feel unlovable so I treat any kind of affection with the highest level of scepticism and scrutiny. I remember being a kid, not knowing how cruel people can be, being trusting and flippant with who I thought were my friends. Then i found out. I was THAT kid, you know the one everyone hated. The one that everyone was annoyed by because existence hadn't kicked the life and joy out of me yet, and they took that personally. So they took it upon themselves to snuff out any level of trust in others or excitement about life. It was hilarious to all of them that I could possibly have a crush, it was even funnier when they told that person and convinced them to pretend to like me so they could get me to be their ""slave"". The only reason I realized what was going on was because I overheard an entire conversation between the entire group about how funny it was, how pathetic I was, and what they thought they could get out of me. I wanted kill myself right then, it's making me want to kill myself just thinking about the fact that they were right. I am pathetic. I am unlovable. 

I am an unlovable unattractive pathetic loser, only I think way too highly of myself. Because I'm much lower than that. 

Not only do I feel undeserving of love, but if I thought for a second that someone did love me I wouldn't be able to live with the fact that they wasted any portion of their life on me. I wouldn't wish myself on anyone. I fall in love all the time, but the positives they would bring to my life in no way justify the negatives I would inevitably bring to theirs. I have nothing to offer anyone, I feel like a scared sad child curled in a ball on a cold unforgiving floor, and I want to cry but I can't, and I want to die but I also want more than anything to live. My lack of a life makes me want to die so bad, the only problem is the math doesn't compute in my head. 

I want to live life, but I'm not, which makes me want to not live? 

How many days can I go in a row wishing I was dead, without killing myself? I'm going on seven.

First time feeling suicidal in awhile,"I’m a 54 year old female, divorced with 3 adult kids. My depression/anxiety started in 6th or 7th grade. I use to pull my hair out until I was bald.

I’ve tried many psychiatrists and therapists. I’ve been through so much in my life that no one should ever have to deal with. 
I’ve been feeling better than I have in a long while due to a new therapist, but the past few days I have felt it creeping back. I feel fat, lazy, useless, unloved, unwanted, ignored. Those old thought are back. I starting to think about ways to end my life. I just want the hurt to stop and to have a somewhat normal life. Is that too much to ask? I do believe in God, but I feel like He has forgotten me.

I want everybody to feel it. But it won't work. This is the only way to show my mental exhaustion and how horrid everyone has treated me. It's the only thing that comes to mind
I will do anything at all now to reflect my mental state. They have boundaries and mine have been torn to shreds.

Please read❗️,"Well.. Don’t not know what's happening and why. I've been trying to commit su!c!de since the end of last year. As you can see, it doesn’t seem to work. Every time. So I'm here to explain the reasons for the failed attempts, and to possibly get answers to why this is happening. 

The first time I tried to attempt, was dy!ng of freezing in my room by opening the window completely. (It was winter, snow outside, the weather was freezing cold and the temperature was minus). Before I even got started, there came a terrible and cruel storm and hurricane that hadn’t been in my country since 2013. It lasted for a few weeks. Which we were all forced not to open our windows or drive outside. The storm and hurricane were so strong that most of the trees fell, and all the houses, apartments and buildings shook like crazy. Therefore, I had to postpone. When the storm and hurricane disappeared, the snow melted too, and it got a little warmer. Therefore, I left the freezing method and moved on to the hang!ng method. 

Many of the other attempts were constantly interrupted when my mother, who leaves me the whole day and is in her room because she hates me, slams my door to get in, (She doesn’t even know I'm about to hang myself), and it happens every time and only a few seconds before I plan to jump off the chair. That's why I never get peace to do it. 

I decided to attempt again when she one day leaves the home to buy medicine. She did. And I hurried out to the bathroom, tied a scarf on the curtain rod and hung myself. I stood there hang!ng for about half an hour. I suffered a lot. Without anything happening. Neither unconsciousness nor death. Just pure suffering. (The ensuing symptoms killed me the rest of the day and the days ahead, shit). Then I hopelessly chose to end the experiment. 

Subsequently, I tried to attempt again. Just as I was about to kick the chair away in the bathroom to hang myself, my mom came. She stayed standing by the bathroom trying to get me out. She kept disturbing and wouldn’t go, so I decided to go out. Again, all the times she has neither seen nor known that I would commit su!c!de. 

The last time I tried to hang myself, something scary happened. I went out to the bathroom and wrapped a string around my neck, sat down and waited to be strangled to death. After about 10 seconds, I looked at the toilet. (By the way, the toilet lid was closed. The toilet is like a mirror, you can see everything in front of it). When I looked at the toilet, (still while I sit down and wait for my death), I could suddenly see in the toilet mirror the shadow of an insanely creepy (witch) I guess, with big, round white eyes, long white dress and black, thick, messy hair. Out of fear, I panicked and hurried to tie up the knot, and frightened I rushed out of the bathroom with my heart galloping. It has scared me ever since, which has kept me from trying again. 

The many other attempts at suffocation with plastic bags and swallow pills didn’t work either.

Sorry my long novel, I even tried to make it short. Anyway, what the hell is going on? What was the scary thing I saw in the toilet mirror? Why am I prevented in my attempts every time? What is it, that obviously will not let me d!e?",[deleted],0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tn471p/please_read/
Its fucking weekly now,"I've been attempting weekly now. WTF is happening to me I hate this. Also, I had a friend (we'll call her K) that told me that if I died from suicide they would follow. Its been years since we've last spoken. Now, in our group chat I ranted and shared how I attempted suicide and failed. Now this one friend of mine told me to not do it since K would also attempt suicide if I do. Like I told him how K and I dont talk anymore so why will K be affected? Like dude he also told me how everyone loves me and dont do it and all the generic stuff. I love them, yes and I'm grateful that I have great acquaintances or friends i guess since the only person im close with in the group chat is K

After the ranting and shit no one cared anymore or something message or somthing. But I dont really care lol. Just sad since in the past whenever a person rants shit, we would always advice and make them feel better. But now that did not happen.

I'm thinking of ending things,"I'm 19 right now. I know life is long and there's a lot ahead of me. That I will find my path etc etc... But everyday I think of ending it. I don't let it on. I sit on my apartment couch day and night. I've pushed away all of my friends. College is decently easy but most days I just sit here and don't move a muscle. I've started doing different things to try to help. I wake up early now, between 5 and 6am, make my bed, brush my teeth, journal for a solid half an hour, and eat a hearty breakfast along with my multivitamins and a 5mg of aderall. I'm prescribed to take 10mg twice a day but I hate how it makes me feel when I take that much. I feel like a zombie when I take 10. No one around me knows right now. As far as they know I'm as happy and healthy as can be. I hit the gym 3-4 times a week. My classes are decently up to date but every now and then I slip up and forget to do an assignment. I have a job. I said earlier I've pushed away all of my friends, but I have a lot of people who constantly ask me to hangout so it's not like I feel alone. I get laid at least once a week usually but don't enjoy sex anymore. I haven't enjoyed sex for a while now. Girls and guys are always caring and affectionate towards me whether they're gay, straight, or all of the above. I'm sociable and well liked by most people I meet. Never had my heart broken. I've had a rough childhood and was part of a cult for two years which did some fucked up stuff to me but other than that nothing too big. I still want to die. I don't just not want to be alive anymore I want to actually die. To feel that debilitating pain of death. I'm not afraid. Some days are better though. I'll get these spurts for a few weeks or days at a time when I tell myself I have to be strong and things start going better and I'm getting everything done ahead of time and making so much progress. Then right back to square one. idk what to do. I don't want to talk to anyone because I'm supposed to be mr. happy and smiley and kind and loving. I'm supposed to be mr. ""has his shit together and everything is easy for him."" But it's not. All I think about half the time is the torture they subjected me to and the other half is taking my life. Though I've been journaling a lot about that tale of odin hanging from the world tree with a spear in his chest. Killing his former self to bring forth a new one. Through the pain, for 9 days and 9 nights he hung there until the secrets of ruins was revealed to him. Maybe if I just push myself to my limit then I can be reborn. But I don't know how to break myself with my current life. What would be traumatic enough to break me.

Just trying to express myself,"My whole life, I’ve been a thinker, not a “DOer”. Off late I Look at trees and think about hanging myself, I look at rivers and think about drowning myself. I am in one of the few situations where cowardice is saving. I have a hopeless inability to execute anything, and that’s the irony of it: the very thing that has brought me to this state of mind is keeping me alive.

I spent years being “social” attending parties and events, drinking with friends from my teens . I actually went to private parties with 50 people and thought to myself I have 50 friends, the naïveté of youth I guess. Over the year the realisation has dawned on me, that you’d be lucky to rub together 5 people who really care about you.  I do have some homies, whom I love, maybe 10-15. A huge number, but for the most part it’s not reciprocated. 

If you’re on social media there are copious calls to action,  in the same capitalistic tone that says “ give us a follow” or “what’s your favourite #throwbackthursday song” self helps posts will urge you to talk to friends or family or get professional help. I can’t bring myself to open up to anybody around me, because I’m convinced that the notion is inherently flawed, how much can somebody really be there for you. They might be cognisant of your mental state for a week, for a month, but eventually they’ll falter, as is their right. The routine of daily life will eburden them and they’ll have to let go off you, one way or the other so they can hold onto themselves. And I fear that the pain of being relinquished would be far greater than the swill I stagnate in now. At least now you can keep up the charade, that when you depart it will be tragic, your friends and family’s will be distraught. In reality they will quickly exercise their right to get back to life among the living, after a few moments of grief.

Once in a drunken, inebriated stupor, I confided in two friends, two friends whom I would have done anything for, whom I loved dearly. Ofcourse, I was also criticizing one the friend for something that was really irrational, which perhaps reduced the potency of my cry for help, but anyway it slipped out my mouth. I said “ I pity myself so much that I thought of killing my self” The moment the words came out my mouth, I instantly regretted it, I had shown a vulnerability that was tremendously personal

Dear reader, can you guess what happened next? In the months that followed I lost both of those friendships and NO they didn’t die, they just moved on. Living the same life, engaging in the same kind of camaraderie, just without me. The situation was so pathetic that I actually recall apologising for saying that I wanted to hurt myself. “I didn’t mean it. I swear I just said it that day cause of the concoction of alcohol and alprazolam” “ I have never thought of it until and since that night” . Of course I was lying.

Lately One of those friends, is a massive proponent for mental health, she shares posts about toxicity, self awareness etc. The kind that would “urge” you to “talk” to someone. I see the hypocrisy, and find humour and hubris in it. 

I wanted to Pen a few words that encapsulated how I’m feeling, it has rapidly digressed into a critique almost. I do however find this exercise to be mildly cathartic and will likely return to it in a couple of days.

"I found this sub, so I guess that means I have a problem.","I have been trying, a lot. And things have gotten better in many ways. I changed jobs, I lost some (but not all) the weight. I have picked up new skills. I have tried asking friends to do things. I have gone outside and tried to meet strangers. 

I am not as consistent in my journaling as my therapist told me to be. I still don’t feel different. I feel more like I tried, and the hill is getting too steep to keep moving forward on ‘better.’

I think the will to ask people in person for help is gone. It feels like whether I am talking about the weather, or grand future plans or something not right and in need of fixing, nothing snags on people’s consciousness. I live alone. I work from home and most days the most I say to anyone out loud is “there aren’t any updates on my end.” When I text people I call friends, they don’t respond for days. Or send an emoji. It’s not conversation worthy. 

Picked up carpentry and made a table? Thumbs up. Built shelves and installed them? Heart. Reported neighbor for abusing dog? Silence. Fermented my own ginger soda? Silence. Had a birthday? Silence, and balloons 2 days later. 

I’m a ghost in this world already. I am honestly considering getting rid of my phone plan because it is just scammers and bills being texted to me. 

I am trying to get a dog. Someone to cuddle and take care of and that might show enthusiasm. But the apartment complex I live in makes it near impossible with the restrictions and fees. 

And I’m here, again, thinking maybe I should just let it go and stop trying. Is it suicide if I stop swimming and just let the tides take me under?

Evidence shows it would barely be a blip on the screen for 99% of people I have met. I just want to be held and cared for. Instead the first time I have ever heard I love you from a non family member was a mentally ill old man in a park, probably telling everyone that passed by.

I am not loved.

I’m basically here surviving alone, trying to keep myself sane under the conditions I’m under. 

My own interests are impossible to achieve. 


I am a batshit crazy piece of shit, disguised as a well-mannered, average looking, tall, slim, smart person(According to them). 



But yeah.  This is something I have extreme feelings for. 


I truly believe I may end up going through with these plans sometime next week or sometime soon. 


Id love to talk to SOMEONE about this.

"no reason to live, might as well let everything get worse","idk if i need to, but putting a big fat trigger warning here for eds, general bad thoughts, and pedophilia, as well as the fact that this is basically a long post complaining about everything wrong with my life lol

i don't see the point of trying to tell myself that it'll get better, when i know that the next few months will be so much worse than now. i don't have any reason to try to keep myself from ending it when my body is already dying much quicker then i'd like, and i don't have the motivation or the purpose to tell anyone how bad everything's gotten. cant forget the fact i am autistic, trans, gay and basically everything else that i won't ever get accepted or treated right for lol.

i don't hate myself. i don't even see myself as a person? i know i have delusions about myself that i don't feel comfortable sharing (even though i'm comfortable sharing literally every other problem i have??) but i hate that i was born in general. i don't think i should have been born at all, especially since i was born a fucking girl. 

being trans is the worst fucking thing to come out of being alive. i would give every failing organ in my body just to have been born a man. i can't come out to anyone in person -i wouldn't be accepted by the majority of people i know anyway- because i won't ever be taken seriously as a man. no one, regardless of who i meet, will ever see me as a 'real man' and that hurts more than anything. people might start using he/him when they feel like doing so, but since they'll still see me as a girl anyways i don't see the point.  
sometimes i think of growing my hair back out, throwing on a dress and pretending that i'm comfortable with being a girl, because part of me thinks that i could come to live with it in time. 

sometimes i consider finding someone twice my age online just to give me fake validation, because it'll be much more than i'll ever get in person. i know its not healthy, but neither am i. i want the worst for myself because it'll make me feel temporarily better.

since we're already practically trauma dumping might as well mention that i've been targeted by older men my whole life: since i was 6 i've been flirted with, PROPOSED TO, and had weird sexual comments thrown at me by adults all whilst my very own mother would watch and laugh, never thinking to tell them to stop. i mean she's never been any better, considering that she is by far the one person who's made my life the worst it can be, but i live with her and will do for at least the next few years, so it's not like i can do anything about it. i'm only 15, who knows maybe this shit is normal and i should just suck it up and deal with it. 

i could go into depth about how my mother has fuelled my body issues and my eating disorder(s), how she's blatantly ignored the signs of autism i displayed from birth (and now makes fun of me/ gets angry at me for) and let me get severely underweight at a very young age because i couldn't handle any food textures and still puts it down to me just being 'picky'.

having an eating disorder might actually kill me before i kill myself. haven't lost any weight from it, but have basically lost everything else. my heart is faring the worst, it's absolutely terrifying feeling it malfunction, but for some reason i can't tell anyone how bad it's actually gotten. i go to the doctors occasionally and they know there's at least 2 things wrong with my heart, but they don't take it seriously unless i experience symptoms (which i do, severely at that, but i haven't told anyone and now i have to face the consequences for)
it's been getting so much worse in the last few months. granted, i haven't had another 'almost heart attack' since middle of last year (i had every heart attack symptom at once, i broke out into a cold sweat in my bathroom and felt the worst anxiety i've ever felt, my vision started to go static and fade, i was practically holding onto my heart and i've never felt so much like i was going to die, not even after i overdosed) but i've watched my heart rate drop to 30 on multiple occasions, and seen it go way above 160 after just walking up some stairs. most nights i sleep less than 4 hours, because every time i've tried to sleep ive been worried that my heart will just give out and i won't wake up. for some reason, i can stomach killing myself, but i  can't handle not dying from my own hands.

i don't know what i want out of this. empty reassurances? someone to tell me i'm not being unreasonable? maybe i just want people to relate?
i think more than anything though, i just want someone to talk to. not even about the bad shit, just someone to engage with and tell about my hyperfixations, someone who won't just ignore me and most of all, i want a friend. i don't think i'll get that here, i don't expect to nor do i really think it's fair.
i don't want to live anymore, and i know that if i reach 18 i'll end up ruining my life one way or another. i don't care what happens to me anymore, because it'll just get worse anyway.

Kids with no dad vs. kids with a shitty dad,"What keeps me awake every night is trying to figure out whether my wife and kids would be better off if I actually did take my own life, versus me continuing to exist in their lives, versus divorce and distancing myself from them as much as possible.

My best mate in my late 20s, his mother took her own life when he was about 10 years old and he hated her for it ever since. My parents split when I was 8, and I have absolutely no memories of my parents as a couple (you know, as ""mum and dad"", together), and I'm pretty sure my dad left to live with his parents because he had wanted to take his own life and wanted to distance himself from us to minimise the impact. He's still alive, looking after his mother, but he never had any passion for anything, and always seemed to be ""just existing"", so I get it (I'm that way too). I don't know of any examples of fathers who decided to just live and not leave the family, because all my childhood friends were also poor kids living in single parent households. I have no friends now, so I don't have any examples to go by. I can see how me choosing to stick around, but the therapy and medication isn't making a fucking difference, could make life shit for my wife and kids. Even tho he's alive, I can't talk to my dad about anything deep or meaningful. My so-called adopted father (my uncle) is so full of BS platitudes and braindead socialist bullshit that I can't stand talking to him about this stuff. I don't have any friends from church, so I have nobody to teach me how I'm supposed to pray about this shit, so I'm getting no answers from Jesus/God. I effectively have nobody to talk to about this. I don't want empathy, I want fucken solutions!

The mere fact that no matter what I do, whether tens of thousands of dollars of therapy, or a half dozen different medications over the last five years, none of it has made anything better.

I'm 21, so I could buy a hand gun from a private owner. I have a pet rat so I'd have to find someone who could take care of him or wait until he passes. I just want everything to be over. I have to move back into my parent's house because I broke up with my abusive ex over a month ago. I can't renew my lease because rent went up. gas prices are high. food is expensive. 

I want to cut myself. I want to cut my face. the only reason I'm not is because I wouldn't want anyone to see. instead of thinking about my trauma, when it tends to intrude my brain, I just think about shooting myself. over and over and over and over again. I want to hit myself in the head. I want to bang my head against the wall. I want to crash my car and spend all my money. If I were to do it, I'd have to give away some of my stuff. I know who would get my bicycle and who would get my rollerskates. I'd drain my bank account and leave my cash for my sister. 

I don't know what to do anymore. but I don't think this way all the time. I don't know. after writing all of this out I kinda feel a little better and I think im gonna try to get some sleep tonight.

Do people ever really change,"I attract awful people into my life because I myself am an awful person.  I’m not oblivious to the fact that I’m flawed.

The duality of life in human consciousness often torments me and I always feel pulled in either direction causing me to have suicidal thoughts.  I try to be good, people pick me apart and peel my scabs.  I give into darkness, and the universe rewards me with earthly delights while my soul weeps the price.  Is the concept of becoming a better person just used to keep us all docile?  I yearn to return to my eternal sleep but I have these idea that life is worth living simply because the other side is where we go when we do not dream. Nothing. No things. Even now I cannot decide whether I want to live or die which just goes to illustrate the main point of this post.

"As young as I am, my future is over. Goodbye","(16f) I’m planning to kill myself, perhaps next month. I’m just gonna put it all out there because I have nothing to lose now. I missed 3 years of school because of mental health and I was in a psych ward for 9 months- due to this I have no friends at all, only my mum and I’m grateful for that, now I’m in year 11, in a hospital school trying to cram 3 years of lost education into my brain. 

My GCSE’S are in a month and I’m going to fail, even though I’m only going to be doing two of them, English language and Maths. I cant even get to college, don’t get me started on uni. I’m going to be a nobody, struggling to find a job.

 I bet my mum is so disappointed in me but she doesn’t wanna say it. 

My future is over, I’m over, even though my life has just begun. I’d rather end it now than be known as the waste child.

I'm a 38 yr old male. I've wasted my whole life. Long read.,"My parents split when I was 3. I lived with my dad and my sister moved with my mom. My father was a super alcoholic and abusive. He used to whip me with cordage, punch me while I was naked because I was taking a shower to long, and basically hit me when ever he was in the mood. When I was 8, the neighbor kid who was older than me, molested me and I told my dad about it. He asked me if I was some kind of (homosexual slang word) and did nothing about it. 

He used to wash my clothes and hang dry them above trash. And I was very limited on the amount of time I was allowed to bathe. Because of this, I got picked on for being the dirty kid. Fast forward a few years, I became the bully as I was psychically stronger than kids my age. I also started stealing food and laundry detergent from the gas station. I would put my clothes in trash bags and bike them to the laundry mat. 

When I was 14 I got a girl pregnant. I also started hanging out with people older than me. I got into fights alot and started robbing places to eat. I got caught and did time in juvenile hall. Afterwards I was court ordered to move in with my mom. She knew nothing about what was going on at my dad's house the whole time. I felt like if I said anything, I would be forced to move and that made me feel guilty because I was all my dad had left.

At 17, I was diagnosed with a nasty skin disorder called hidradenitis suppurativa. Basically, I get boils in my armpits and on my butt. There is no cure and surgery usually doesn't work. It just comes right back. This made me skidish when it came to dating and I was also dealing with my molestation the whole time. Throughout my whole teenage year, I thought i was gay because of what happened as a child. 

When I was 22 I met A. I fell head over heels for her and vice versa. About 3 years in I became extremely possessive, gave her zero space, and never did anything fun with her. We broke up. I could see she wasn't happy and asked her one day if she needed to leave and she said yes. It was over. Throught my late 20s I would check in on her to make sure she was OK. She would get in a relationship, but then break up and we would start chatting again. This happened 3 times but I never fully pursued her. I could tell we had unfinished business and that she had the same feelings for me as I did for her. I knew she could get better so I let her go. 

It has now been 13 years and I haven't dated serious since. I have relived our break up 1000s of times. I will dream of her and wake up, and it starts all over again. 
That mixed in with my past, my skin disorder, my job that I hate even though it's good money, my addictions, my dying mother has me to the point where I don't want to live. I've also recently learned that my dad's house burnt down and he has been homeless, living out of his car for the past few years. I don't know how to react to that. 


For years now I have told myself that when my mother goes, I'm going to kill myself. I've decided to wait until she goes because she has been through a lot as well and I want her to not be alone when she does. My dad wasn't good to her,  then was abused by step father (he died), and all while dealing with severe kidney problems and vitamin deficiencies. I don't really have a relationship with my daughter. I was a bad father as a teenager. I've tried to do better but I don't think she would ever forgive me for not being there.. 

My mom's health is steadily declining so my time is approaching. I've recently bought a gun and now it's all up to my mom. To those of you who made it this far, I'm sorry this post is so long. I needed somewhere to vent because a lot of this stuff I have never told anyone.

"I'm thinking of ending it, and can't find any good reason not to."," 

I'm going to vent a bit, bare with me.

My whole entire life has been torture, from childhood abuse, neglect, CSA, repeated abuse by all of my romantic parnters, to all my pets dying one by one to unbelievably unlikely causes. One of my earliest memories is trying to kill myself by jumping off a tree I had climbed in recess in 1st grade. I was miserably bullied throughout my school years, and I am not exaggerating when I say I had not a single friend til I turned 14. This friend turned into my first love, which placed me in an extremely co-dependent, abusive, and toxic relationship for the rest of my teenage years. This person was my everything, my only source of interaction each day for 5 whole years. My parents gave up on me a long time ago, and I was allowed to rot in my room from age 10, doing nothing but playing video games, going through the internet, and occasionally getting groomed by older men because again, nobody really paid attention to me at all.

Fast forward those 5 years, I had stopped going to school, and my whole life consisted of; Wake up, messaging my bf, waiting for him to wake up at about 15 pm my time (he lived in Florida, I was from Europe), talk to him till he goes to sleep, repeat. I never did anything else than spend time with this person, he made sure that he was my only source of social interaction. He was my everything, and to this day I am convinced my brain is so messed up at this point that I am unable to live without him, or at least that's how it feels. Our relationship was pretty much ""If we ever break up, we both kill ourselves."" in a glorified light. He encouraged me to be 100% dependent on him, and due to me being so developmentally behind due to no good social interraction/relationships till I met him, I grew to think this is the norm.

And then, he left me. He'd twisted me into such a broken person by the age of 17, that he himself couldn't take it anymore. He left me through a person I never even knew, this person messaged me and sent me a text he wanted me to see. Basically; ""You're too far gone, I don't think I can fix you anymore.""

I had a total mental breakdown and tried to end my life at least 5 times in the next year or so, trying to learn to live without the person who had basically made himself the center of my life, my reason for living. I know it is my fault too, being so dependent on him, but we were both kids. I realized I had wasted my entire childhood rotting in my room, no goals in life, no interests, nothing else than waiting for my boyfriend to wake up and make me feel like I am living at least some kind of life.

Now, 2 years later, I'm 19. I've had five relationships since then, all either emotionally or physically toxic &amp; abusive. I still am in one actually, my boyfriend's and I's relationship consists of; getting yelled at because I unknowingly made him mad, tiptoeing around everything I say so he doesn't leave me, trying my hardest to please him and take care of him, only to be yelled at and snapped at a few minutes later because he finds something to be mad about right away (ex. I forgot to do the dishes when he wanted me to do them an hour ago). I wake up and I dread the upcoming fight of the day, try to appeal to him when it does happen, and go to sleep listening to him telling me how much of a horrible person he is.

I don't know if it is my fault, honestly, it might be. I think it is, actually. I could just leave him, but then what. I'm, alone, without any purpose to live again. At least I have his cats at this point when I do stay with him. He gets mad at me, then lovebombs me, and repeat. I can't get out of the cycle, and the worst part is we live together, and i cant get away from him. Every day is like this.

I know even if I break up with him, I probably either won't find love again or ill end up in another cycle of abuse. I have no hope in fact, so I've just pretty much given up. I still, unfortunately, think my first boyfriend was probably my true love, and I messed it all up. He's living his life with his new boyfriend and I'm still here, even worse than before.

And that's got me thinking, there's really nothing stopping me from killing myself right now. I have no reason not to. My parents are getting older, and they'll die too. That's another hit in the gut I'll have to face, and then I'll surely do it anyways. So what's the point in delaying it anymore. I think ill have much more of a blast not existing at all, or being reborn, or idk, going to hell if that's the case with LGBT and stuff. I have all the means to do it in any way I want to since I've prepared them in advance. So right now, I'm just looking for anything, literally anything to keep going. and I cant. find. a. single. fucking. thing.

I've tried so hard to find friends, through discord, Instagram, Twitter, through real-life, hobbies, anything. nobody fucking even knows I exist. it's a horrible life, living like you're not even there in society's eyes, all the while being treated like shit behind the curtains.

it's fucking miserable really. but kind of my own fault. so I really don't know. I really don't know anymore. I don't know what the point of this post is. I don't know what I'm trying to say. whatever the case, at least I did put myself out there I guess.",iiyaiiya,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tm1xrr/im_thinking_of_ending_it_and_cant_find_any_good/

The Way The World Is,"This world is honestly a dark place filled with narcissistic people. I hate everyone, I really really do, I hate the smile and laughter of others, the only people I can care about are my family and other people I can empathize pain and just overall depression with. People have honestly just dragged me down to a dip hole that I have dug myself along with them. And honestly that hole is almost 6 feet, I can't stand almost anyone, my mother and some of her family, but most other people I just hate for no reason and I suppose it's the hate the world has given me. And also the way it just is now, people so self invested in themselves that empathy is being fully replaced will narcissism.

I have almost nobody to talk to, it stresses my mom out I know it does, and I don't like to talk to other family because they tell my mom and it worries her, and my few friends never take me or my mental health seriously. I am a human but I have been treated like some type of animal or someone from another planet.

I have minor autism and am also a Schizo (Not Schizophrenic I am a Schizo which are a little different) so people think differently of me. I also used to be such a happy and funny guy when I was younger, but as I got older people got meaner, and I got more sad because I was treated differently and had random people telling me they hate me or don't like me in school. And some I didn't even know.. I admit I was a little off the walls back then but it was mental issues and people gave me more than I already had.

My hate for the world is strong, so strong that I honestly believe I deserve better than this fucked up, hateful, intolerant world... I just want peace, paradise, some type of better afterlife. This world is going to end soon, and we all deserve a bitter end, so even if I don't kill myself at least I can see the world end and all of us get the chaos and destruction we deserve, we have brought hate and destruction to our own home(Earth) 

They say we are one big happy family, but the reality of Earth is that we are one big, dysfunctional, toxic, family... A family that kill each other and are each other's biggest enemies along with each other. A family that has lost it's morals as time goes on, a family that has little love to give and more hate. What have we done to the world and ourselves? Right is wrong and wrong is right. 

My point of all of this is that is humans are nothing but garbage on this Earth. We don't recycle, some of us are treasure to some, some of us are thrown out and forgotten about,  and some of us are littered and left to blow in the wind until we are picked up one day or are forgotten as well in the end.

I hate the world, it is my biggest cause of depression, and that's how I know my depression will never end... Because the world keeps on going, and when it does end I end with it. So the way I see it is my depression will go on as long as the world goes on. Or until I'm forgotten about like a piece of garbage or I'm one of the pieces of junk that is treasure to others... 

Lately I have been severely depressed, more depressed than I have been in a long long long time. And I just want some people to know that this world eats you alive. And some of us have to accept being junk or treasure.... The world is a dark and hateful place, and Idk if I'll see a light one day or an even more dark place... I wish you all the best in this dark lonely world.

I've been through more shit than most of you people could ever say. And I don't say that with pride. I wouldn't wish my depression or trauma on anyone.

Now you may be sitting here wondering ""why do you want to kill yourself?""

1.) I went through a troubled teen program when I was 16, and was basically abused for profit for 2 1/2 years by strangers I didn't know. If you're unfamiliar with what I'm referring to, look up r/troubledteens, or go watch Nexpo's video on YouTube ([https://youtu.be/7eM7pb5M5DU](https://youtu.be/7eM7pb5M5DU)). It's a really sick industry that somehow fucking exists in our country. My parents essentially sent me halfway across the country against my will... away from all my friends and family without even getting a chance to say goodbye. There I was physically, verbally, and mentally abused for years on end. I had limited opportunities to communicate with certain select individuals outside. I was treated as lesser than human, and bear in mind that this was while I was experiencing depression already. I've been through horrific shit at that place. I've been choke-slammed into a door by the director of the program, and have been threatened to be beaten up by him. I've been forced to sleep outside in a tent, a sleeping bag, and a single layer of clothing for 3 nights straight during one of the record worst winters in Montana history, while everyone else got to sleep inside in a warm bunkhouse. I've had a tree fall and hit me on the head and instead of being checked for head industries, I was literally laughed at by the staff. I was forced to partake in manual labor every day. I was practically treated like a slave. They would even have punishments where they would force you to carry around buckets filled with rocks everywhere you went, even in public when you went into town. So not only were you being treated like a slave, you were also publically humiliated. They would shave your head when you got there to essentially rip away any form of identity you have. Anyone that spoke out about the program to their parents was punished. There was a point where I had written a suicide note, and the staff somehow found it. They ended up sending me to a mental hospital. While I was there, I was forced to have daily phone conferences with my parents. I would tell them what was going on at the place, but they wouldn't pull me out. I often walked out of the room mid-call crying my fucking eyes out. My father even told me once ""you know that little 'stunt' of yours in the hospital cost me $20,000"". Okay fucko, so 20 grand is more important to you than my fucking life? During one of the rare instances where we would get to see out parents, we once had an activity where the parents wrote a mock eulogy for their child. My dad wrote one for me, and by the time he got done reading I realized he knew absolutely nothing about me. He was near tears but I was completely expressionless. I don't buy his sadness. He never once bothered to get to know me. It took me 3 years to convince my mother of what happened to me at the program. I still don't think my father knows. He keeps reiterating that that place wasn't all that bad for me (this is what is commonly referred to as the ""sunk cost"" fallacy).

2.) My parents are horrible people, and have never shown me genuine love. As you can probably tell from above, I hate them. My father is constantly condescending to me, and my mother is toxic and manipulative. My own mother has even said she would send me back to that place if she could. A couple years ago, I was involved in a car crash. I hydroplaned and flipped a pickup truck off an exit ramp during super bad weather. My dad was the first person I called. Rather than asking if I was okay, he yelled at me for supposedly not knowing how to drive a truck. I told him he was the worst fucking father ever and abruptly hung up. I called my mother afterward. She answered with a flat ""what."" I responded based off her tone with ""you know what... nevermind. I'm sorry I called."" She responded with ""ok, bye"" and hung up. It took my brother yelling at her for 5 minutes for her to call back. When the rest of my family found out what my dad said to me, he was shamed by everyone for it (as he should have been).

3.) My girlfriend I've been dating for a year and a half recently broke up with me. I moved cross-state to be with her. I quit my jobs, college, left my home state for her. I used the stimulus money I had waited to receive for a year (because my bastard parents claimed me on their taxes) to help buy her a car. I helped her get the job she wanted and offered to drive her to work every single day so long as she had the job that made her happy. You know what happened? Well, for starters, she ended up downplaying to her friends how much I spent on the car (she told them I only spent $900, when my bank statement shows I wrote a check for $1400). She would never thank me for driving her to work every day. There have been other things... On my birthday she got upset at me over something and made me upset. She had bought tickets for us to go to a haunted house (since my b-day is at the end of September). Instead of coming to talk to me and cheer me up, she put a pic of the tickets on her Snapchat story with the caption something along the lines of ""anyone want these?"". Think that's not bad? I had an instance where me and a friend of mine got into a fight and my then-landlord pulled out a revolver and said someone was gonna get shot if we didn't stop. When I told my girlfriend about what happened, she straight up said ""I don't care."" She ended up dumping me on Valentine's Day of all days. I had dropped $100 on V-Day gifts for her and had planned out the whole day for us (I was gonna take her to see a movie and I was gonna buy her dinner, all on me... and I don't even have that much money to spend). The night before, she told me that V-Day means nothing to her and that it's a stupid fucking holiday. Roughly around this time she started going over to her friends' house that she used to not hang out at very often, seemingly out-of-character, and with no explanation to me. I don't have any solid evidence of her cheating, but I'm sure you can understand why I was suspicious. She took down all the pictures of us together, archived all the TikToks she made of us... One night because I forgot to leave the back door unlocked, she started talking shit to me. it escalated to the point where she said she was gonna bring her friend and come ""fuck my shit up"". When she got here and started arguing with me, she ripped off my necklace (a vial of her blood that she made for me). I literally had to scream at her that I didn't want to fight her. She deleted the message she sent because it ""made her look bad"". She never cared about my feelings, and has been encouraging me to kill myself.

There are other things, sure, but these are pretty much the main reasons why I plan on killing myself. Trying to move on past my trauma is practically impossible. All I've ever wanted to do is to try and make people smile because the world is too fucked up for everyone to be miserable all the time. No matter who I help though, I can never help myself. I force myself to smile. I force myself to wake up every day, knowing I'm fighting a losing battle against my depression. I've done it for 6 years, and I'm tired of fighting. Everyone would be better off without me. I'm just an inconvenience to everyone. Sure, family will grieve, but I know they'll just do it for a little bit and then move on and forget about me. A small price to pay, in my opinion.

I'm not here asking to be stopped. I don't want to be stopped. But since you're here, could you give me some tips on the best method? I want to go out in the fastest, most painless way possible. I just want to get it over with. I'm worried about what happens if I don't succeed. I don't want to be permanently fucked up and have to live with more misery if I fail.",iwasathrowawayonce,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tm1ebv/posting_this_because_i_plan_on_killing_myself/

I don't want to live anymore. it's too overwhelming,"Hey guys I'm 16 and female and I've been struggling with my mental health for the past years. I've had a lot of suicidal episodes. All of them were in my head so I never actively did anything except wishing to die but the wish of dying got bigger in the past months. I just hate my life and I struggle so much. It's just crazy. I don't see any pleasure in living but my problem is that I feel like I'm not 100%ly sure if I want this. 
My reasons of dying 

1. I might have OCD and this shit is just a living hell. I keep ruminating so much and I just can't continue to live like that. This sickness has taken so much lifetime away from me 

2. I have horrible thoughts about the people I love the most and I'm scared I might have harmed them in any way and I wouldn't be able to live with that 

3. I just hate life. When you see me from the outside you'll think that I'm a happy person but I'm not I struggle with anxiety and panic so much they're part of my daily life 

4. I just have too many issues 

5. All of the pain will be over 

The problem is that my elder brother past away a month ago and my family wouldn't be able to handle two death children. I told a close friend about my suicidal thoughts but I think that he didn't fully understand me. He doesn't know that this is something that I'm considering all the time. 

About therapy: I can't get any help bc of my parents so no matter what you'll say about therapy it won't be possible. I just want everything to end. I've suffered enough. I've had enough of this life. Maybe I'm being selfish but I'll have to do what's best for me. 


In the last days I haven't been able to do anything good. I mostly laid in my bed on the phone. I just don't find any motivation in things. I eat very bad and then my stomach will hurt the next day. My sleep schedule is fucked up too but it has gotten better in the last days. I feel so sick and when I'm with my friends I play the girl who's always happy while I'm not. I just hate life
I've harmed myself a few times but it was just biting myself. I wanted to do more extreme things but then I didn't bc I don't see how self harm could help me . I'd like to die a painless death. Or maybe commit suicide indirectly so that my family won't see that I killed myself",Ok-Willow8579,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tlz31q/i_dont_want_to_live_anymore_its_too_overwhelming/

Do we know anything about death?,"Hey... I posted a question here a while ago, but no one answered. I don't know if maybe my question got private it or something. I don't think it broke any rules... 

It's just that I'm afraid death will leave you conciouss until you decompose or get cremated, or that you'll suffocate due to not breathing...

In need of a message of hope,"I’d been free from suicidal ideation for a few months and am distraught to be back in a place of despair. I started a new job, a stepping stone to what I thought was my career goal and it seems to be something I’m not cut out for emotionally. I’m a behavior therapist and my clients honestly disturb me, sometimes have me feeling depressed as I feel there’s no hope for them. This is very frustrating because this is my third career path and I’m only 22.

My sleep quality is dipping severely as of late, the time in which my brain is supposed to heal. I’m seemingly unable to eat consistently - binging then fasting over and over. My new therapist doesn’t seem to be much help. I’m a recovering alcoholic and addict but I’m finding myself craving to escape with substances. It’s not an option however, because it would grant me homelessness as I’m currently in a sober home. 

It’s hard to connect to people. I’m in a very self-critical mindset lately, judging my words after every interaction i have. I’m even feeling internal homophobia. I feel this may be the sign of a positive internal reset and spiritual awakening, but it’s overwhelming. Nothing feels comfortable right now.

Something snapped in my psyche at 18 years old, four years ago, and I’ve essentially been miserable since. I was diagnosed bipolar type I. This means without medication or proper self-care (i.e.: sleep), I can have an episode of severe depression or mania, wherein my mind works in overdrive and it may feel good in fleeting moments, but is ultimately disastrous to my life. While manic I’ve ruined my credit score, crashed 3 cars, and ruined relationships through verbal violence that is a byproduct of my lowered inhibition at this time.

With sobriety, medication and meditation, I had been doing well. But with a new fork in the road in regard to my career, terrible sleep with disturbing and stressful nightmares, and utter confusion and frustration as a result. I can’t even bring myself to suicidality because I’ve tried it quite a few times. Pills, other types of pills, intentional carbon monoxide poisoning, cutting major arteries, and more pills.. with alcohol. 

Life just seems to be an endless series of pain and suffering. I feel like getting in my car and driving. I want to drive to a remote area in a state that is foreign to me, park my car and just walk. Starve to death, find a cliff, and enjoy the sight of a new scene while I’m at it. 

What scares me is surviving and being more miserable with a set back. That is typically what happens..

And even if I wasn't too depressed to do these thigs, what is the fucking point? Do you know how humiliating it is when people see potential in you but you're too fucking depressed to try? It makes me even more depressed knowing im a wasted potential. Look at me now gloating about this shit, this is why i hate myself. Honestly my birthday is the worst day of the year for me, i absolutely despise it. But knowing I can plan my death for my birthday is indescribably peaceful. I hate how even the things I used to enjoy doing are a chore, everything is just a fucking chore. Typing this is a fucking chore.

I want to die,"I’m a 16 yo guy and I want to die.

I feel like a bad person. I have like 2 friends and I never hangout with them other than school. I have a gf, and I love her with all my heart, but I know she could do better. Not to be cocky or anything, but I’m probably top 5 smartest in my school of 1400. I will probably go to a decent college and have a lot of life ahead of me. I just feel tired with life though. 

I think I might be mentally ill. I’ve fallen into this personality of being the crazy person of the group. I hate silence because then I think about how much I hate myself. I say or ask random stuff to end the silence that make me seem retarded. 

I don’t smoke or do drugs, and not on any medication, but I was thinking last night that the way I want to die is an overdose. I work in fast food, and some of the people I talk to at work are drug dealers and I think they would sell to me. I’ve thought it through and maybe I buy multiple non lethal quantities and then use them all at once.

I’ve been more depressed than usual this last week. I do football and wrestling, and it’s the off-season right now so I should have gone to an off-season wrestling practice. My gf knew I was doing this. The only time I’m really happy is when I’m around her. I needed to see her so I skipped practice to hangout with her. She was already with her girl friends and I didn’t want to be a jerk and just come out and say I need to be with you.

Tonight I think is the limit. Im always horny. It’s all I think about and my gf rarely wants to have sex because she was molested in her sleep twice by a family friend she still sometime sees. This last week I kinda learned if I keep asking her she will give in. We were in my basement tonight and cuddling when I tried to finger her. I did not force her. I asked multiple times for consent. She let me do it and gave me a handjob. We both finished, and I said do you want to go to the park where we usually have car sex? She said yes so we went

It was still kinda light out so we went to target and Walmart and walked around. She showed me this Lego set she wanted for herself. I was having a great time. When we got in the car, she said she didn’t want to have sex anymore. I was extremely disappointed because she got my hopes up. I did not force her though. She said she was sick of me always talking about sex. I replied saying it’s the only thing I can ever think about. She got mad and we sat in silence for a bit. She asked to go home but I begged her to stay out for another hour until our curfews. She agreed and went went to McDonald’s for sprite. I apologized probably 15 times about it, saying I’ll be better. 

I know she could do better than me, but I can’t bring myself to break up with her. She says she only wants me, but I want her to be happy with someone that would treat her better. I’ve decided to finally go to sleep and let her move on. 

But the important part is her period is 4 days late right now. She might be pregnant. Neither of us believe in abortion. If she is pregnant, I plan on staying alive and supporting it. If she’s not, I’m going to buy her the $100 Lego set she doesn’t want me to buy for her. I’m gonna overdose after that. I think I will write her a note saying sorry and it’s not her fault, one to the school and friends asking them to make jokes about it, and one to my 10 yo brother ,to say sorry and leave him everything I own, Xbox and $2000 in my bank.

Scared,"I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for five years now. It has stolen those years from me; crippled me from doing things I love due to my low body weight, made me unable to think rationally and study diligently. 
My family are exhausted - mum especially; sleeping beside me because she’s terrified I’ll die alone in my sleep. It makes my heart rot thinking about the hours they’ve spent worrying about me, or the time and money flushed down the toilet finding me treatment. I always disappoint them.

The mental health team I’ve been going to have been more harm than good. Mum tried to send me to them as early as she could after spotting my illness. They did nothing to prevent it from spiraling out of control - which it shortly did. I had a useless councillor who would stare at me in silence for an hour every week. Once she broke it to ask if I drank chocolate milk (pretty self-explanatory considering I had anorexia). My parents and I left each session in tears.
After politely asking if we could swap councillors, the team began bullying my mum. They thought we were attacking the councillor I was seeing. This meant they refused to offer me a bed at a residential care, and threatened to stop paying for my weekly doctors visits unless I disengaged in seeing a private therapist (whom I was making progress with).

Today I found out my mum’s pleas to put me into residential care has been accepted. I’m scared shitless. What worries me most is how much they’ll fatten me up. I’ve read somewhere patients are only released once they’ve restored 75% of healthy weight. However, I’m also aware I’ll be alone with sick and possibly more malnourished kids than myself five hours away from home.
I lost it when I heard the news - screaming and crying my eyes out at my mum, who should never deserve to be treated like that; she has done everything she can to keep me alive. 
Both her and my younger sister are so sick of me. My sister hardly ever speaks to me. When she does, it’s usually to yell at me for being an idiot and retarded. Once she even told me she was embarrassed to go out in public with “that” (me), and wished I died of cancer. Honestly, I wish so too - especially when I remember how close we used to be.

I went to my mum after dinner to ask for some support. She told me I was so selfish for continuing to engage in a disordered lifestyle, and then taunted me when I said I couldn’t drink an additional supplement formula. 
I’ve pushed those I love away from me. I’m so alone and lost. I’m praying to God I get sick and die, because then they wouldn’t think I was “doing it for attention” or “being selfish”.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"Almost Every day I get intrusive thoughts to kill myself. I’m having a perfectly normal day and then one thing happens and I immediately start thinking about how I should just die. I just turned 17 in February, and i was planning to do it before I turned 17. Now I’m planning to do it before I’m an adult. I can’t go into a store without going into the tools isle and looking at the 7 dollar rope. 

I can’t stop thinking about it.

Now I’m in my hotel and the only friends, those friends fucking got in a group without me, so I’m in a room with sophomores that I don’t even know. 

My class, They all begged me to come here on the school trip for months before we came here, but I didn’t want to because I thought I would be dead by now.

This might actually be it for me,"Since I was a child I've battled depression. My first suicide attempt was when I was 12 because according to my religion, you're not liable for your sins until you reach maturity or puberty. So I figured I'm 12 and miserable so if I end it all now, I won't have to go to hell. Drank a bottle of Tylenol and ended up in a hospital getting my stomach pumped and swallowing charcoal. 

In college I met the love of my life. We understood each other on a level nobody would understand. We both had issues. Hers was that she was molested by her father. We were both fucked up and our relationship turned very very toxic. We'd break up and get back together all the time and her family never liked me because I was a year younger than her. They wanted someone ready to take her in and provide her with everything. 

The last time we broke up after 7 years of being together, she swallowed a bunch of pills and stopped breathing. She turned blue, ambulance was called, they resuscitated her but she stayed in a coma.  Doctors tried to get the family to pull the plug because they said she's brain dead and even if she did wake up she wouldn't be the same. I stayed by her side the whole time, or as much as her family would let me. She stayed plugged in and 2 months later she woke up. Couldn't speak or feed herself or do anything. She was like a newborn baby. She went through therapy but couldn't get all her functions back. She's still in a wheelchair. Her body shakes uncontrollably so she can't feed herself. Seeing her like this broke me down in pieces. I couldn't see her like this and one day I left and never looked back. I still feel a lot of blame for this. I tried to have other relationships but they never work. 

I'm 30 now and live with my younger brother. Not talking to my other two brothers or my father. Don't really have much to live for. I have a problem with opioid prescription pills. The only way I get any type of relief but it's an expensive habit since I only use prescription pills. 

My mother who was never really there for me or my brothers growing up (she was always dating other men because she couldn't stand my father) has recently broke up with her latest husband and came to live with me and my younger brother. She's a drama queen who's always miserable and makes me and everyone else around miserable with her. 

I have a decent career with decent money but no goals really. 

I recently bought a few grams of heroin since I figured it would probably be the best way to go, dying high as fuck in pure bliss. I'm just shit scared of being resuscitated and ending up in a wheelchair like my ex, or being reincarnated into someone living in a third world country or even hell. I made my mom promise not to resuscitate me if anything were to happen to me. 

I'm just not happy. I have nothing to look forward to in my future. I'm thinking maybe I'll just take on the heroin habit without the intention to die and hope I accidentally od some day. I mean it happens like every 10 seconds in my country. 

I tried antidepressants and they work to help my mood sometimes, but if you really have nothing to live for, there's no cure for that. 

I also just lost my job so perfect timing for that. I don't even have the desire to look for another one. I wish I could just sleep and not wake up.",Past-Acanthisitta-28,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tm00s7/this_might_actually_be_it_for_me/

I try to push all my problems to the back of my mind, but that doesn't fix anything. I still question what the point of doing anything is. I'm so happy I defeated this super hard boss in this game!!! But, what greater purpose does defeating that boss have? What greater purpose does completing a video game have? Fundamentally, I do not enjoy life, so all I'm doing by playing games is distracting myself. It doesn't matter if said game I played adds to my knowledge or expands my worldview because I know I will kill myself in the future. Right now I'm just on autopilot.

For years I've tried not to think about my problems and had hope that things would get better. But I had false hope. Things haven't gotten better. There's only a slim chance things will ever get better. I wish I realised this sooner. Maybe the fact people keep repeating that one generic line, ""things will get better"" was why I believed they would. Now, I've learned hope is nothing but a coping mechanism. 

Im just so frustrated that my consciousness was ever brought into existence. Why couldn't I have stayed in the void? Now I see no point in doing anything. I'm just floating here unsure of what direction to go in. I'm unsure if there is any point in watching a movie, letalone making any meaningful decisions. I'm stuck in limbo.

I told myself I'd wait this year out at least, but I'm starting to see there's really no point in prolonging the inevitable. So why am I here writing this?

The reason why Im posting is dose anyone else feel like they would be better off sleeping for an extended time (like hibernating) then you don’t have to worry about stress anxiety depression etc.   Im probably not gonna do suicide. Another thing I thought of, so I was talking with one of my doctors (I didn’t like her) but she asked about my depression and if I thought of suicide I said no not really I said jokingly about MY depression no one else’s depression/suicide. I said if I was thinking of actually doing it I think I would be to tired to do it I would rather sleep than do it, I thought this was funny……. My doctor didn’t think it was funny then lectured me how I shouldn’t joke about suicide.

I'm laughing and I'm crying I don't know what to do. I think my friend is suicidal. Scrap that. I know they are. And the problem is I'm kind of suicidal too. 


I see no point in life, but I've become sort of stuck in a rut of repressed emotions for a while. I feel nothing, so I have no desire to do anything, let alone to kill myself. But I'm worried they do. They said they would see me tomorrow,  so I don't think they're going to do it tonight. They said they want to, but they see no point, because they always fail. 


I don't know what to do. I cant ask for help for them because I promised confidentiality, and I know the pain of that trust being broken. I can't do that to them. That is not an option. I know they're safe for tonight. The only problem is I don't know how to make them feel better. Or if I can. I'm terrible at comforting people at the best of times, and now, I'm  half asleep and I think I'm a little triggered.

( for context My dad used to always tell me he was going to kill himself if I left him, and he would detail how worthless he was and ways he would kill himself and sometimes he would SH and almost attempt in front of me, as well as me being suicidal myself on multiple occasions, so it's a touchy subject)  

I don't need people telling me to call the police or tell anyone else. I need advice on how to make them feel better. I can't bear the thought of one of my friends feeling how I feel, or rather how I've felt. It's fucking torture, and they do not deserve that shit. They said they can't talk because they feel like an attention seeker, and I tried to reassure them but I'm crap at it. Please I'm begging you, give me some advice, something I can do to make them feel better. The thought of them in pain is agonising. They don't deserve that. I just need some ideas on what to do.

I’ve been wanting to kill myself because of my recurring dreams,"
At this point I’m just tired of living and I miss my old life. I used to have a happy family with just me, my mom, and my dad. Then they had a kid, 10 days later my dad dies of stage 4 colon cancer. He already had Crohn’s disease so I wasn’t that surprised. Then my life slowly sank over the next decade. My friends started to become toxic and my new stepdad hated me. I got used to it. Recently I met this girl in school and I really like her (we’ve been talking a lot and I think she likes me). But I also keep having these dreams that feel like lifetimes. These dreams are about different people I know and they get to be so emotional. I get attached to some random people I barely know and develop a life with them (like a full blown 50 years of life). These dreams emotionally hurt me so much because then I develop feelings for these people. In some of these dreams I have kids and defend them emotionally from harmful family members. It’s stupid but it makes me want to kill myself. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have these dreams endlessly and I cry after every single one. Every single night. I just had one about a random girl in my school. I dated her and had a kid and everything. I have to hide my emotions from my family every time I see them.

Anyone else?,"I've come to the realization that I am, without a doubt, suicidal. But at the same time, my life has been, more or less, defined by suicide and I know all too well what it does to the people close to you. And because of that, I know that I'll never go through with it.

Some background, I'm 34 years old and my first brush with suicide was when my father hung himself when I was 16. I doubt I ever really healed from that and 16 is still such a formidable age. I thought I was doing okay but the last couple of years have taken a toll. I'm also an Iraq veteran. I deployed in 2010-11 and in the last 4 years, 3 of the guys I served with have committed suicide.  The most recent being 3 weeks ago. It doesn't get easier.

I guess what I'm really getting at is, I feel like now I'm just in a 'run out the clock' situation with life. I have no motivation for anything, I don't really enjoy anything and I just don't want to be here anymore. But I won't put anyone that I love through the pain that I've felt and continue to feel.

Chaos,It seems there is no more joy in this world. The world has literally gone to shit. It’s scary and truly saddening. People fighting for climate change having protests as if that’s gonna change a goddam thing. Everyone is diagnosed with some type of mental illness even if they’re not they tell you they suffer from some type of anxiety and depression. There’s 0 originality these days. I don’t even remember 2021. When I look outside everything appears in a darker shade. Everyone is trying to bring back old trends specifically the early 2000s and reselling clothes/items from that era at an insane price which pisses me off. Everyone feels nostalgic. Bringing up memories from the past anytime before 2020 more than ever these days which makes me even more sick because we can’t relive those years. Nothing to ever look forward to. No good music no nothing. Everyone pisses me off. There is truly no one like me and if there is well I’m sure they live very far from where I’m at. Earlier I was thinking about vine and how that turned into musically and how that turned into tiktok which is just filled with such inappropriate vids. I had to delete it because my fyp was filled with people romanticizing eating disorders and people deliberately showing their fresh self harm cvts. This generation is seriously mentally ill. I’m so exhausted from living. All I fucking do is complain because there’s too much shit to complain about. This world just keeps turning into a more dark and darker place and the fact that people are still having kids in a world like this even during the pandemic is just beyond me. There’s clearly no hope for any of us. I can’t keep living in a world like this. And then the fact that I have to slave at work while my manager sleeps downstairs or is sitting on his ass getting paid minimum wage is just insane. I don’t understand how people have put up with this for so long. Every day I get closer to the day I planned to take my life and I don’t even know how I feel about it. And some days I feel nothing. Yea call me a coward but at least I’ll be gone. No more dealing with this stupid shit and stupid ass New Yorkers.

Scared of future,"
I’m just so scared of the future, I’m making specific scenarios of me getting hurt by someone I love and each time it usually ends up with me wanting to or actually killings myself.

I say I don’t want to kill my self at the moment, but what about the future?

"I want to die(well, obviously)","I want to die. I don’t know if I want to kill myself but I honestly don’t really care. I just want to die and not be conscious and not be an “I” and have no ability to experience anything or remember anything or think about anything. I don’t care if it will get better. I don’t care if I’ll be happy one minute later. I don’t care that I’m irrational right now and I’m thinking something that a level headed version of me would obviously be above.

Suicidal and tired," 

I wouldn't necessarily say ""I don't know what I really want in life"". It's more like, I'm still experimenting on what I enjoy to draw...and to make a career out of it. Hopefully replace it with the current job I'm working in.

As for the current job, I'm working as a custodian. Housing custodian at a university. It's a lot of work and you got to be extremely fast pace and versatile. I'm diagnose with Chronic Depression, Anxiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It's so hard trying to keep up everyone's expectation. I'm always slow and having a hard time trying to finish everything. I just feel like...I'm letting people down and I try so hard to push myself over my limits to match theirs. I can only do what I can and I even told my supervisor about my disorders, to accomodate me. Which he did....but I still feel like perhaps I'm not the right canidate and I'm fearing the call of being fired and getting complaints for not finishing certain amount of floors on time.

My mindset so far: I'm doing what I can, and if it's not enough... then I tried my best. But I know with my mental disorder, I will go back down the spiral.

I called my supervisor and express my frustration. Even though he said everyone adores me and I'm being too hard on myself, I know these compliments won't last long. 

I really don't want to quit this job. But I feel like shit when I'm bringing other people down with my slow, dumbass illnesses.",shaneinvasion,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tlxo33/suicidal_and_tired/
dealing with severe acne has taken such a toll on my mental health. i am so broken,"i havent left my house in weeks. i quit my job. i spend a good 2/3 of my day crying, i dont know what’s happening to me. my skin took a complete 180 this year and destroyed any little self confidence i had left. has anyone else felt like this before? all i can think about is my skin, its taking up my life. not only is it unbearable to look at, it’s painful and itchy and i cannot afford a dermatologist. looking at myself in the mirror always results in a full blown panic attack, i end up hyperventilating on the floor. I have cried to the point of vomiting many times. I hate that it has this power over me. It’s such a silly thing to worry about and I KNOW that, but it is absolutely destroying me. it is a continuous cycle, this constant stress only results in more breakouts. I feel trapped in my own skin. Talking about this in real life makes me sound vain. I wish someone would understand. The crying seems to never stop and I havent slept in days now.

Life is so shit,"Life just fucking sucks.

I hate everything, but above anything else the most I hate is religion. I cant help it but say that I do not understand religions and their concept. Guess what, I had to be born in a religious family, fuck yeah.

Because of that, I am constantly threatened by religious friends and family, looking at me like I am a disgusting being, constant physical abuse by my mother just because I disagree with their belief. I never was disrepectful to them, I just hoped that I could be free and decied wetehr or not follow the religion but no, my mother is more worried of what other family members think of her so she tries to force me to not reject religion or else, my family will think that she is a bad mother and look down on her. My family is a fucking joke.

This is not my only reason that made me start having suicidal thoughts, I am a teenager male so I unfortunately still depend of my mother. But that does not matter because I decided that after finishing uni I will kill msyelf. I am weak, I cant even handle a full time job, I have no realistic goals, I have no ambition and even less motivation to do anything.

It seems I am not suitable fort this world so the only thing I am able to do is fuck this shit. I give up. I am not strong enough and I know it is pathetic and cowardly.

My moods are very unstable and I hate living like this,"My moods change fast and I don’t think I am bipolar as it’s usually a reason why my mood changes and it can all change in a day. Like I’m in a good mood and then like couple hours past and I just get negative thoughts and I’m down again. 

Like I already lost people this year, my ex best friend, who used to be my best friend like 2 years ago and losing him as a friend this year didn’t really hurt as it was my decision to cut him out of my life. He was a real bad narcissist and probably a sociopath so cutting him out felt good. The one thing that hurts is losing my sister as we used to be so close but recently she became a lot more social and has a lot of friends and she doesn’t even want to speak to me or spend time with me anymore even though I’m the older sibling. I’m 23 and she’s 20. 

It’s just scary how easy people can just leave your life and even though I have a best friend that is good to me and I am talking to a girl but I’m just worried it will end as I’m just bad with my emotions probably because of my anxiety. 

I’m really not sure how I can get better. Like sometimes I feel great it feels like euphoric even, like I’m more hyper, talkative and confident but it never lasts long. And then I’m just back to my usual mood just being sad, depressed and anxious. I know somethings wrong with me probably, I tried cbt therapy for anxiety and depression but it didn’t really help me. I’m on an antidepressant as well which has never worked on me I just take it as it makes me sleep. 

I hate living like this I just want to smoke weed and get drunk so that I can stop all the negative thoughts and I hate it. It feels like my life is a mess. It’s so much effort to get out of my bed and I just hate my life like wtf.

Insecurities,"Well, I’m a 20 year old black male. Growing up I was always in last place, always an underachiever, always the skinniest always the one without the game with females always the ugly one always the one with lack. The jokester who tell jokes to keep people entertained instead of having them clown me but that made them clown me even more. I used to piss the bed n shit lol n i had like a bladder problem or some shit n I would take adhd medicine and I would piss myself as a kid and that was another thing that fucked my reputation up badddd. I used to get bitched out all the time. My fathers father had raped his mother so my father had a lot of insecurities so he would juice up to make him appear stronger and physically bigger bc of his insecurities in his own masculinity or what makes him man. So he was a beast pretty much and I think he was on crack when he had me bc I came out superrrrrrr fucking active I was everywhere I couldn’t be still for shit very rebellious but was super fucking smart but just extremely active. So now I’m 20 still a virgin never had too much of female attraction through experiences you know🤷🏾‍♂️so that gets me lost in masculinity and what makes a true man. Then my father left when I was 17 right before I step into the manly world and didn’t wanna come back after my mom told him no. He left and went stayed with my uncle n his gf n she was a crackhead n he had sex with her so my was like fuck no nigga gtf outta here so he left and didn’t give us money causing our lights to be off for like a week and a half straight like 2 weeks type shit no food , no fucking money to get clothes no money to have cable for months.

Im getting wayyy better like I’m way cooler than I ever been but I’m not super confident tho💯. I tend to not want to talk to ppl bc I’m afraid of not getting treated like I want to bc my misunderstanding of my self values bc of my experiences being limited.

I’m Very handsome btw lol very fucking handsome not to brag but it’s true lol but fuck bruh idk y’all love y’all selves sometimes I just want to leave mad not do this shit bc everything is slavery.

I’ve attempted more times than I can count,"

(Nearly an essay) 

This journey start 10 years ago. I was 16. I’d already been diagnosed with Premenstral Dysphoric Disorder at 13 for uncontrollable fits of rage and crying til I was shaking every day a day before my period started. At 15, they tried putting me on the pill. It didn’t help. But I was happy with my boyfriend. I was a straight A student. Beautiful. A ballerina who sang like an Angel. My boyfriend made me happy. He was my dopamine. I was happy and content for a year. We were finally at third base. He felt my boobs under my shirt, I put my hand down his pants and stroked him, he did the same to me. We never were unclothed. But we dry humped like teenagers do. I orgasm for the first time. The second time the third. We go to Disney World. I share a bed with my mom he sleeps on the other. When my mom goes to the bathroom in the morning we steal kisses. I cry tears of joy watching the fireworks with him in front of Cinderella’s castle. I love him deeply. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. And we were close to having sex soon. 

Then one day the next week in July, he called me and tells me “I just don’t love you anymore.” I was devastated. Utterly abysmal in every way. I beg him to explain. He has no explanation. I thought we were perfect. 

After crying myself to sleep every night, sleeping with my mom again because I couldn’t control my constant will to die, my mom started bringing me to therapy. The therapist told me to my face that I was the most depressed individual he had ever seen. A few weeks pass. Endless trials and failures of different antidepressants. I have a major panic attack. I’m screaming out to God on deaf ears “Please take it away. Please make it stop. I don’t want to wake up anymore!” This was the first time I tried, but stopped because it hurt.  I agreed to be hospitalized. 

“I don’t  want to die but I didn’t want to live like this.” 

They admitted me to the pediatric mental ward. It was HORRIBLE. The first thing they did was strip search me and check every inch of my body for scars or any marks. They pointed out a little white mark on my toes that scarred because of repeated blisters from dancing on pointe and being a ballerina. 

The girls there were violent. They had tried to murder their grandmothers. They had hallucinations of people speaking to them through the tv telling them to stab people. There were daily fights. I felt like I was in prison. Every night I screamed crying in my room. They told me I wasn’t allowed to do that. They told me I couldn’t cry. The doctor told me I was acting like I thought I was better than everyone else. I tell him I’m not like the other girls here. I don’t want to kill any one I just don’t want to live like I am living and want help. He is dismissive. I am released. Nothing is better. If anything it made it worse. Now I had trauma from my time there. 

3 months go by. I am in therapy and a psychiatrist office every week. I still cry every night. I still sleep with my mom because she’s afraid to let me out of her sight during the night. She holds me as I rock back and forth until I finally pass out. 

My ex boyfriend ignores me in the hallways. I mourn for him like the grief of a death, and I see his ghost every day. I wear high heels and dress to the nines everyday. All the boys notice me, but him.  I appear bubbly, beautiful, and like I’m a perfect girl, yet I am in agony on the inside. I stare at the walls during AP language just to try to fight the never ending dread. I go to the bathroom to cry. I have a student say to me “Why are you so happy all the time?!” in a mean tone and that “Just being around me makes him feel poor.” I run to the bathroom and break down. I call my mom. After 30 minutes I return to class. I tell the boy that my dad is a used car salesman who sometimes doesn’t even bring home a paycheck. I’m not rich and I’m not as happy as I may seem. Life goes on. I continue the charade. 

I get the attention of the foreign exchange student from Spain. I like him back, he’d be a good distraction especially if I could fall for him. He rides his bike over to my house we cuddle and watch movies and end the night in sweet kisses, we go ice skating. He asks me to homecoming by holding up a giant sign in my favorite class dressed up in a suit. I’m happy for a few days. Things are looking up. A little. 

Then I see that my ex has been asked to escort one of the girls on the homecoming court. That night, I break. 


I am screaming, crying shaking, banging my head against the wall hoping I’ll give myself a concussion and not wake up the next day. I run into my dads closet and press my back hard against the door to keep my mom out. I attempt again but it hurts. It hurts too much. My mom is desperately trying to push her way into the closet. My dad comes and eventually gets his hands on me. Slapping  me across the face and grabbing me by the neck and throwing me on the bed because he didn’t know how to stop me and it enraged him. 

He didn’t understand. 

I fought back. Once my mom was able to get him to let me go, I ran in the bathroom and locked the door. My mom calls and the police on my dad. My dad convinces the chauvinist southern cop that I was attacking him. I scream that I was defending myself! He says that he doesn’t see any marks on me and that he could just as easily take me to jail. The cop leaves. 

The next time I go into an episode my dad is violent again. I make sure this time I have red marks on my arms. I rub them where he’d grabbed me to make sure they are still red by the time the cops and ambulance get there. 


They take me to the ER with my mom. They let my dad off again. The next day I’m escorted by ambulance to a facility 3 hours away called PineGrove. Tiger Woods had gone there for his addiction. It’s really nice and they only take non violent kids. There I found help. They put me on Lexapro. Things started to get better. My parents visit and for the first time in my life I see my father cry. He tells me he’s sorry and how much he loves me and that he just wants me to be happy. I hug my parents. When the social worker comes I tell them that I made it up and that my dad didn’t hit me. 

I go home. The Lexapro puts me on a baseline. I’m not happy. But I’m not screaming in agony every night. My ballet keeps me distracted. I go to homecoming with my beautiful Spaniard boyfriend. I had told him and the other kids at school I had been in the hospital for an ovarian cyst. Eventually we break up. I never really cared that much. He tells people he only dated me to fool around and because I had big boobs. In reality all we ever did was kiss on the front porch. 

I continue on. My grades are immaculate. I start dating my boyfriend I had in middle school again. After he had a motorcycle wreck. I love him and he really loves me. He had PTSD from the wreck and is in a cast from the waist up. He self medicated. Our relationship is incredibly volatile. He wasn’t the Shakespeare quoting boy I’d dated at 13, now he was a leather wearing motorcycle riding bad boys. I was still ballet and straight A’s. We date for a year breaking up and getting back together every two weeks. I know he’s on drugs. He lies I believe him. Happiness, mental abuse, manhandling me, slapping me. Steroid rage. High on who knows what. He scares me sometimes but I love him and always get back together with him. He does really love me, we were each other’s first kiss before and first loves. 

I make a high score on the ACT and graduate early. I go to audition for musical theater schools. I’m accepted into NYU with a full tuition scholarship. I’m ecstatic. 

After a year together we start having sex. He wasn’t a virgin. He’d cheated on me multiple times. I was. I can’t orgasm. I’m embarrassed. I talk to my new psychiatrist reluctantly. Sex was taboo. I went to church twice a week. I was made to feel like it was reserved for you husband. I am very embaraased to talk about it. She tells me it’s a side effect of the Lexapro. We keep dating it’s June or so of the summer before I leave for college. 

He cheats on me again. He gives me an  incurable STD. This time it’s over. I break up with him. I’m devastated. I feel so dirty. He was supposed to be my forever. We have lunch one last time before I go to college. He gives me a beautiful Pandora bracelet. And tells me he will always love me. I know he will and so will I. 

I go to NYU. I don’t date for two years. I don’t want to tell anyone about my STD. My gynecologist says it’s alright that it’s now undetectable and that this type doesn’t transfer easily anyway from genital to genital because HSV1 really only thrives on the mouth. I haven’t had another outbreak. I eventually start to date again. 

2017 I meet a Brazilian billionaire. I fall for him. He could have easily fallen for me… but he held me at arms length. He shows love with his actions but he pushes it away. He doesn’t want a girlfriend. He loses his visa and I tell him… “You know you don’t HAVE to go.” He tells me “I am not ready.” I am heartbroken. 

I start trying to get off the Lexapro. I want to be able to orgasm. I do fine on Wellbutrin and Trintellix but the orgasms don’t return. I graduate. I’ve gained 30 pounds since high school “too fat” by Broadway standards at 150. So I work backstage. I’m exhausted. 6 days a week. I don’t audition. I have lost my confidence. I no longer think I’m beautiful like I was in high school. 

2019. I go home for the summer between jobs. I finally have a good relationship with my dad. I go back to work. My dad dies suddenly from a heart attack. He was only 66. I went home to stay with my mom for a month before returning for a new show working backstage. My boss is horrible.  

In October, I meet a man. He is also from South America, he is a brain surgeon on a brief fellowship in NYC for 3 months. I immediately adore him. But after 4 or 5 dates. I push him away. I didn’t want to be heartbroken like I was with the last guy I’d dated and I knew I would fall in love with him if I kept seeing him and then he would leave. He tells me around Christmas that he can’t stop thinking about me. He wants to come to Mississippi to see me before he goes back. I don’t let him l, but we text, talk, and FaceTime as much as he can being a full time neurosurgeon working at 5 hospital. I think he’s superman. He’s so charming and kind and sweet. I didn’t ever think I’d meet anyone more suited for me than the Brazilian, but I hope this might be it. We make plans for him to come to NY in April. I’d go to South America in June. 

March 2020…. The world shuts down. Broadway shuts down. Covid forces me to flee the city. I go back home to my mom down South. My family make rude remarks at Mother’s Day about people getting so much money on unemployment. It hurts me. We don’t leave the house except to go through drive throughs. I can’t see my neurosurgeon. I miss him. The next year is really tough. I’m grieving my dad. I can’t see the man I love. But March 2021, I find a GREAT apartment for $1500 in the best part of the city. A “pandemic deal” they call them. Everyone says that they can only raise raise your rent 5% each year anyway so I’d be fine. I’d made more on unemployment the last year than I had in 3 years of working. My mom comes up to help me move in. I climb on a stool to put a basket on top of the kitchen cabinets…. I fall and break my foot and sprain the other ankle. 

I go back to Mississippi. I can’t walk. I can barely go to the bathroom on my knee scooter because I have an injury on both feet. I have to have surgery. My doctor is rude and had no bedside manner. I feel like a number. Ive gained 30 more pounds. I’m 175. I see stretch marks forming on my body. I’m embarrassed. I hate myself. I don’t know the happy beautiful girl I was at 15. She is a stranger. In my cast I roll into my dads closet again. I can’t control it. I’m in agony is so so many ways. I’ve lost so much. I attempt again. It hurts. I stop. I make at least 3 more half hearted attempts that summer only leaving wells and bruises on my head. Unable to walk. Miserable and fat. 

I finally can walk. I get to see the man I love for the first time in person in 2 years. I tell him that I’ve gained weight over the pandemic at this point about 30 pounds. He says he doesn’t care and that I’m still beautiful. We go to Disney World. But he is different than the first time we were together. He used hadn’t been able to keep his hands off me in NY. We’d had sex 3 times a night without stopping. Now he wouldn’t even make out with me in bed. I feel unwanted. Is it my body? I ask crying. He says it’s just weird that we don’t really KNOW each other in person and he doesn’t know how to react. I wonder if he had erectile dysfunction. I thought this was going to be a honeymoon like trip. That he’d finally tell me he loved me, but no. We had fun, but we had quick sex one time that week. Despite my efforts and beautiful lingerie. I suspect he may be an autistic savant. Masking so well that no one except those that are closest to him can tell. 

I go back to work backstage when Broadway opens. They worked me 90 hours one week. The actors treat me like I am less than them. They act like I’m their maid and unimportant. I forget how much more talented I am than them. I sing like a nightingale and am a classically trained ballerina. They make me fell worthless. I sprain my ankle backstage. I’m already suicidal. I quit. 

Two days later. My ex boyfriend. My first love, the bad boy, overdosed on Spiked meth and died. I was devastated. I was already suicidal 

I can’t walk again. I have lost so much. I don’t want to work in theater anymore the man I love isn’t affectionate. I’m now 185 pounds. My stretch marks are purple and red all over my belly. I don’t have a job. I don’t know what to do about the man I love. He still plans to come in December. But I’m prepared for another disappointment. I can’t find the will to live. I start to prepare another attempt. I call my mom I tell her  my plan and that i can’t keep doing this and this will be painless. She calls the police. 30 police show up and involuntarily commit me to a psychiatric ward in New York City. She flies up. I hate her for taking away my choice. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I fake it to get out of the hospital. Tell them I didn’t have intent. I had even asked if the item was returnable when I bought it. 

I am out in 3 days. I tell my man what happened being open for the first time about my mental illness . He is distraught but as a doctor he understands I can’t control it. I get ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression. They help me to not be suicidal almost immediately. He comes up and my mom flies out the same day. They get to meet. My mom loves him. 

As soon as we were alone he rips off my clothes, I think this is going to be much better than the last vacation, but he is quick and I am dry. No foreplay but I just wanted to feel close to him and wanted him. I want him inside me forever. I want him forever. We have an amazing time together the next couple of days. I try to initiate again in the bubble bath but suddenly the water turning back on because I was cold completely takes him out of it. We go to sleep. The next night I dress up in head to toe red lingerie. A corset and long flowing robe. I look like something out of a magazine. I have my hair done in 1940s waves and professional level makeup. I light candles. I keep trying to kiss him. He doesn’t seem interested I demand to know what is wrong. I tell him I’m in love with him. He looks at me confused like he couldn’t possibly understand why I “thought I loved him.” “We haven’t spent enough time together for you to love me.” I tell him i do. I tell him I want to spend my life with him. I want his beautiful smart babies. I want him body and soul. And he won’t even have sex with me. I ask why?!? “Do you have erectile dysfunction? Are you not attracted to me?!” He says he doesn’t have a problem and that he just thinks the word love means that he’s ready to get married and we haven’t spent a month together in person, though we’d been in a relationship for 2 years. I tell him I want to be exclusive. He agrees. I tell him that I’d tried to date after he rejected me in Disney world but no one would ever compare to him. He understands and agrees that he doesn’t want to see other people. I am crying. I snap at him to blow out the candles. I go to cry in the bath tub. I know he hears me. I calm down eventually. I come out and he is rolled over. The candles are blown out. I wrap my arms around him and tell him that I want to work things out. And that because I love him I want to be there for him until he can get his license here. He rolls over and holds me through the night. We are happy. He makes me happy. I talk to my psychiatrist. We both confirm that there’s a high probability that he is autistic. I accept it. It helps me understand him better. 

I go home for Christmas. Omicron surges. I’m afraid to go back to the city. 
In January, I get word form my landlord that it’s time to renew my lease. They’re raising my rent $800. I don’t have a job. It’s perfectly legal. I am having my home ripped away from me. I start searching for apartments online I can’t job search in NY if I don’t have a place to live by he end of March. I find the PERFECT apartment. It’s a rare rare gem. Studio apartment with a backyard rent stabilized for $1100 in the best area of NY. Chelsea. But because I don’t make 40x the rent and my mom doesn’t make 80x the rent to be my guarantor I can’t get it unless I find someone who does. I call my aunt and uncle , my half sister, and my other aunt who all make over $100,000 a year. One by one they all respond “I have to think of my own family first and can’t be financially responsible for you.” I thought they were my family. I thought they would care. They knew my mom would’ve covered for me if anything had happened but they didn’t care they wouldn’t sign for me. I attempted to od.  I knew the chances of success were slim but I was desperate. I tell my mom I’m so sorry but I can’t do this anymore. I run into the woods behind our house. I keep running. I see them searching for me. I keep running. Eventually I find a long strong vine. If the pills don’t work.. this will have to do. I put down my coat to lay down for a while I feel weightless but my heat rate very high. I hope to die. But I get up to look for a tree just in case. Then they find me. The police. I had run 5 miles into the woods. They don’t let me go back to get my coat. The ambulance driver said I was lying that I what I took “ Your eyes aren’t  even dilated.” and that they’d spent hours looking for me when they had calls for people with actual emergencies. I told him to piss off and find someone else to sit in the back with me. They hold me in the ER in a dark cell for hours. I am in and out of consciousness mostly from exhaustion. They tell me I had metabolized the drugs  from all the running. I am involuntarily admitted. The doctor in the ward is a literal sociopath. I ask to be transferred to Pine Grove. He denies my request. He takes me off my antidepressants cold turkey “just as an experiment” I look at him in the eyes and ask why he is smiling does he enjoy my suffering? He says “I’m just a happy person.” I say “ Are you sure you aren’t a sadist, on the spectrum, or a sociopath.” I walk out and demand he release me after my 72 hour hold. He practically ignores me for the next two days. They tell me I can’t cry again here, that I’m disturbing the other patients. I yell after the nurse that they aren’t giving me any help. What am I supposed to do??? She threatens to put me on the violent floor for people who can’t control their emotions for yelling at her. I go back in my room and continue to cry screaming and heaving at the top of my lungs. They let me out after my time is up. 

I tell call my man and tell him what happened. I see him start to cry. I tell him I love him again. He tells me “You can say it now.” He knows it’s real. He didn’t believe logically before but he knows. 

My birthday comes. I’m 26. I’m losing my insurance, my apartment, and I don’t have a job. I have to go back to NY to pack. I continue to look for apartments but the prices are too high. I hate my family for refusing to sign the guarantee and refuse to speak to any of them. My friends offer for me to stay with them in New Jersey. I don’t want it. I cry every night but I don’t have a choice I’m being forced out of my home. The place I had made beautiful and wanted to love for years to come. The realtors come to my apartment almost every night running salt in my wounds showing countless people MY apartment at the new price at $1400 more than I paid. I cry every night. I don’t get out of bed in the day. 
Out of sheer luck I get a job. It’s working from home doing very boring tech work. But at least I don’t have to get out of bed. My mom comes to help me move. I can’t do anything I’m paralyzed. I haven’t showered in a week or more. I eat microwaveable foods. I sit and cry while i shower. Everything sets me off. I look in the mirror and am disgusted at what I see. I’m at least 190 now. My friends make comments about my weight. I can’t even pack a box without having to lay down. My friends call me selfish for making my mom do the work. I can’t make myself. Now I’m staying with one friend until the others apartment is ready in her house. This friend tells me I have to “choose to be happy or go home to Mississippi, because she can’t have her son see me like this.” Im on my second day. Im miserable. My clothes don’t fit. I can’t find my clothes because my mother packed for me. The only thing I remotely look forward to is seeing my man soon. But I dread living in New Jersey with no independence. I don’t want to fight every day. I tell my mom I hate her for calling the cops on me twice and forcing me to live. I don’t want to. I beg for release. I beg her to leg me go. She won’t. SHE is the one that is selfish. I’m in agony. Every day is agony. Everyday for the past two years almost has been agony and I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to be in this body. I don’t want stretch marks. I don’t want a double chin. I don’t want to live in New Jersey. I don’t want depression. I dont want they anxiety, I don’t want the PTSD. And I most certainly don’t want to live. How come it’s my body my choice applies to abortion, but we can’t have autonomy on whether or not we can end our life peacefully? At this points it’s not about the feelings of other people after I’m gone. It’s too painful for me to keep existing like this. Nothing helps. My depression is a void that is never ending nothing makes me happy except being with my guy. But he’s 5000 miles away. I mask it as well as I can but these days, but I barely can force myself to smile. I’m tired of being called selfish. I’m tired. I’m just tired. I don’t want one response saying anything like “there is hope” because NO treatment has helped. I’ve tried everything for 10 years. I hate life. I hate the constant bad things happening to me. An endless barrage of bad. Moving? Let’s break her foot. Moving again? Let’s make her break her tooth in her sleep the night before from stress grinding. Find a perfect apartment? No one trusts her enough to be her guarantor. In love? He lives in a foreign country and won’t say he loves you back. I’m tired. I want the right to die with dignity. I don’t want it to hurt. My independence is taken completely away. I have no other options. 

I don’t know why I felt compelled to write this. Maybe just to share my pain. See how others cope. I don’t see an end. I tried to edit so that I didn’t break and rules mentioning methods. I’ve never told anyone all of this except my mom. I love her.

I’m exhausted,"I had so many suicidal thoughts last night while I was driving to try to make myself feel better. I thought drowning is scary but I can go put my car in the river and drown. Then I went well let’s look up to see what medications we have that might do it. I’m just so tired. I’ve tried so many different medications at this point. I do therapy. Nothing has worked. I’m still holding onto a little sliver of hope things won’t always be this way. Maybe one day I can keep my house clean all the time. Maybe one day I won’t be so stressed and anxious. Maybe one day I’ll be able to stay consistent and do well at my job. If feels like it’s further and further away. I also just believe I’m a total fucking failure at 26 and discredit all the things I’ve done because it’s just not good enough to me. I don’t know how to stop the negative self talk. Oh, and I’m also sometimes hearing voices lately. Sometimes I know they’re not there/real. Other times, they sound like they’re right next to my window or in my house. I really wish I could just not exist for a week or a month. Why can’t I just shut it all fucking off for a while? I even just had a nice date with my partner, and I’m already back to thinking well, I should still kill myself soon.


Update: almost took a handful of pills last night. Saw a counselor and now going to a different treatment center where I’ll actually get counseling and not color all day. They think I have bipolar II and that’s why antidepressants won’t work. Feeling slightly hopeful since someone FINALLY listened to me. Here’s hoping I don’t ever have to feel like this again or at least very rarely. Much love to all of you.",racinnic,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tltfao/im_exhausted/

Hey… tried to have my first potential attempted suicide yesterday… parents don’t want to bring me to the hospital and the only people who seriously care are my friends and my old school counsellor,"Long story short… I haven’t been feeling well for the past two weeks, I think it’s a depressive episode. The day befroee yesterday I was already damn done with life, but yesterday was my final straw. I have only seriously had suicidal thoughts 5 times in my life, and have never wanted to do actually do it before. (I have a fear of death), but yesterday was horrible. I was actively searching for stuff to kill me.

And as I expected, my family’s first reaction is to scold me, saying that even during school holidays they have to worry about my ass, and I’m not even in school right now, what do I have to be suicidal about. They just straight up scolded me, did not give a fuck otherwise. 

It’s been a day…and idk everyone’s pissed at me and I’m at my wits end. I’m actively asking to be hospitalised but the people who actually has the authority to do that are too pissed at me to want to do that. And complaining about how “it cost so much to go, u are hurting all of us, what happens if it’s in the record for the rest of your life?”

First of all, what life? My whole life my family dynamic is fucking bullshit, it’s not abusive or even manipulative. It’s just that no one communicates with each other, probably because we know when we do, fighting will ensue. So no one talks to one another… idk what I can do all the time, the rules change all the time, idk how to talk to them, Idk what they want from me.

This cycle is just gonna continue until 1 day I eventually snap at them or snap at myself. If I snap at them, I’m gonna get scolded. I knew the only reason they would actually not scold me is if I actually did it, but I know if I did it, I would have let them won and I will most likely survive. And I hate that only if I actually did it would they actually care about me. I do not know what I’ll do for the next few days and I don’t trust myself. I actually wanna go to the hospital but no one lets me.

Finally Got Permission,"Someone I thought loved me, my ex fiancé of six years just told me I should go kill myself. Oh and just a few weeks ago he said I should go hang myself. So I guess I can just go do it now. Clearly everyone in my life will be better off if I just end it all now. I finally got confirmation of that. Oh, “do it on your birthday so you can go out the same day you came in”….April 29th is my birthday. So. I guess it’s happening. He cheated on me on my birthday last year anyways and knocked that girl up so. I guess it’s time now. I should start preparing and I’ve been trying to get rid of all my stuff and give it to friends or donate it anyways. My cameras are going to my best friend. My video games and consoles can go to my nephews. I have another niece or nephew on the way that I won’t get to meet but it’s ok I guess it’s better that way. I am giving my clothes to domestic violence shelters and a couple friends. I’m going to give all my art supplies to my best friend too. I have tons of unopened canvases and paints. I’m going to give my books to the library in my hometown. I’ve got a little over a month I think I can do it then. I have a surgery I fought for, for over 2 years on the 12th but there’s really no point in doing it now. I guess I’ll just call them and tell them I back up, give my spot to someone who needs it. My sister has her gender reveal on the 27th so I guess that will be my goodbyes. They won’t even know it but I will tell them I love them a lot and in my notes I’ve written pages upon pages of apologies for being a failure of a daughter and sister…hopefully they forgive me…I had a long note for my ex fiancé but I’m not giving one anymore. He’s far away and my family hates him so there’s no guarantee he’d get it even if I wanted to. I have been wanting to die for years, since I was little. I first broke a mirror and cut myself at the age of fucking 7. I’ve had nearly ten different attempts. I think it’s finally time. I don’t want to live anymore and I finally got permission by someone who claimed to love me that I should just do it. So in a way it was a huge gift from him to say that, I am thankful for it. It gave me peace. I can just do it now. And be done with it. So honestly, awesome. I’m so relieved.",DoloresHaze7,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tl0tmq/finally_got_permission/

Help... I don't know what to do!,"Hi guys, it's late night now here in my time zone. I can't shake down the urge to go to the building rooftop and take a leap. It's 16 stories tall. Should I do it?

Please tell me a logically sensible suggestion...

My Reasons:

My family got COVID-19 the past month, but it affected my otherwise healthy 50-year old dad the most. Within a couple of weeks of infection (including ~10 day isolated hospital confinement) things just kept getting worse, so he was moved to another hospital for ICU confinement, and there went into lung failure. Doctors decided on intubation, things didn't stop there, and currently he is on ECMO in a different hospital. It's been about 2 months and he is yet to show any progress.

I work and used to live alone, but recently we all have been together. From my fam's side, my dad is the only breadwinner and he controlled their finances. So, naturally I took the heat during his absence as a stopgap - running his business for a couple of months, paying bills, and medical expenses, food, etc. 

I have burnt through all my personal savings, sold my cryptos, and taken all the possible loans just to stay afloat with the expenses. This has made me terribly depressed and made me unable to continue working since last 2 weeks. By the end of this month I can't even pay my dad's insurance premium - in that case the policy is gonna lapse because of 3 months of non-payment. 

I don't see a way out of this. I need about $30k+ just to cover the dues. And maybe another $20k+ for the future expenses. At this point I can't get out or stop this snowball effect.

My mom isn't willing to work, nor does she have the experience to work any decent jobs. My sis just finished her high school, but is trying for a job anyway. Even if we all work in this place, we can't possibly make a dent in the dues and expenses. All of this is taking my self control off, I feel like I'll snap and go insane any moment.

But... I and my dad have life insurance policies. My dad's policy is just gonna pay $100k if ever. On the other hand, my head can pay out a quarter million dollar claim. It can solve all the problems and save their lives. I can also get this miserable life to stop hurting me any further.

I like to think logically, philosophically, and pragmatically. I don't see a better option than this. Should I do it?

TLDR: My healthy 50-year old dad got COVID-19, went into lung failure, and is currently on maximum life support on ECMO. I've bankrupted myself supporting my fam and am still in need of about $50k or more to settle the dues and for further expenses. I'm at the verge of insanity from all the pressure. I've a life insurance worth $250k. Should I do the deed and let my fam claim the benefits so that they can solve everything and live better lives?

Anyone felt suicidal as far as they can remember? Has anyone felt like it would actually make a positive impact ? 21 m,"
Context:

grew up in a pretty abusive family and always wanted to Jill myself even as a young child. It get worse till couldn’t cope and went to child services at age 11 as I felt I was going crazy. I was removed from my family and never saw my mum /sister again .

My suicidal thoughts seem to not always be here now but come in waves.

I’m feeling pretty suicidal now as my gf left me but it made me reminiscent of my last suicidal episode about a year ago.


This was the most intense one yet, I had plans and everything. The last thing I had to do was to speak to my mum and sister before I passed away.  I spoke to my sister first and she basically was horrible to me to the point I couldn’t speak to my mum out of guilt. Turns out the abuse got a lot worse after I got removed and my sister blamed me for it. It hit me pretty hard . I didn’t end up speaking to my mum.

Here’s where things get interesting :
As I never spoke to my mum, I never killed my self.

She ended up dying a few months afterwards.

Now I feel weird. If I had rang her and killed myself would she have been alive? It sounds silly but my mums illness was caused by sadness, I’m sure if I spoke to her she would have survived. But then I would be dead?

So would my suicide have saved a life somewhat ?

This now makes me more suicidal , as I didn’t speak to her before she died.

But this time I don’t have the courage to kill myself.

Heartbroken and feeling worthless,"I’ve made multiple posts of this same topic as a way to seek help wherever I can. I have no desire to be alive anymore.

I am 24 year old black non-passing transwoman who decided to begin transitioning at 21. I’ve gotten to the point of getting my name changed, but now I feel that it may have all been a mistake. 

It’s not that I feel like I’m not trans anymore, but that I can no longer take the pain and judgment of being trans. I was taking seven pills a day with hormones and had a huge increase in emotional irregularity, anxiety, and stress. I embarrassed myself in several ways to friends that I valued and after two months of reckless sex and drug abuse I found everyone around me pushing me away. 

It’s been six months since my last suicide attempt and everyday I wake in pain of missing my friends. As I relive all the things that happened I just want to end it all.

Despite wanting to do things, I was always discouraged by others or mostly my own lack of ability/motivation. I don't think therapy would work for someone like me. You have to want therapy and actively do it. I actively work against myself because I think its only a matter of time before people just give up on me. That or I push everyone away first. I make mock gun motions out of reflex and I've never owned a gun. I have the simple thought of death most days. My roommate nearly caught me the other night looking over our balcony. I just don't get it. I have no direction and it seems like most activities eventually just upset me. I either stay stagnant, the way I am and achieve nothing but stay safe and ""comfortable"" while also going insane from a lack of fulfillment. Or I try to bear being upset and uncomfortable through a bunch of random things throughout my life, probably ending up something that isn't really worth it for the struggle. They both sound awful. And I get it. Life isn't fair. Maybe I don't want to participate when things aren't fair.",MrRemingtune,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tldkwb/im_the_lowest_ive_been/

TRIGGER WARNING - suicide questions,"please do NOT read if you’re in a bad mental state currently. 

Is it painful to overdose and d!e on medication? 

Can someone who has experienced an 0verdose from a combination from the following list please explain the sequence of events: adderall, doxepin,  duexis (ibuprofen + famotidine), pristiq, abilify, buspar, alcohol, and c0caine.
Do any combination of these allow someone to d!e in their sleep without feeling pain?

I know many prescription medications (including some of the ones previously listed) are designed to make death from taking too many difficult. 
I also know surviving an attempt can be very painful and lead to lasting negative health effects. 

What do you do if someone is unresponsive locked in their room? 
You’d call 911 and they would be the ones to break down the door and enter keeping you from seeing anything right?

Lastly, can a family cover-up someone’s su!c!de attempt and keep it a secret/out of the media? Can they just tell people it was a drug 0verdose or is there no way to avoid everyone knowing what happened?

I’m sorry for these asking these questions.",user108416,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tlml50/trigger_warning_suicide_questions/

I need advice,"I’ve just had enough of everything I don’t know what to do anymore or who to talk to. I tried to end my life twice through overdose and that didn’t work. I have episodes where I just don’t want to be here anymore I get agitated and it doesn’t matter what anyone says or does it doesn’t make it any better. I fear that I will have an episode of contemplating suicide and I’ll just jump off a bridge it’s like my mind takes over and I don’t think of anyone else. My last resort is sectioning and I know what it’s like (I live in UK), but I feel like that would be the safest environment for me where I can focus on getting better without having that constant worry of ending my life. 

Can anyone provide any advice at all I would appreciate it.

Who am i even bothering writing this?,"I (18m) have fucked up my whole life and i dont really want to kill myself but im really running out of options.

When i was 9 years old i was diagnosed with borderline disorder and all my life i have been fucking everything up (relationships, friendships, family members, jobs, my studies,...). I have been acting very impulsive and i have aways been blaming my disorder instead for everything i ded (drug use, victimless crimes (somehow i still have some principals left) hookers,...) 

Now today's situation is i havent felt ""fine"" in 6 years or something like that, I am on the edge of getting myself in seriously debt, i live in a small shitty appartement and the only thing that has stayed with me during all these times is my weed. Maybe it sounds retarded i dont really know but its true, i even lost my momma on the way (she is not dead, just doesnt want to speak to me anymore) i lost all my friends because of ly shit behaviour and lies, i lost a relationship of 2 years recently. And to be honest i deserve it because i can blame my disorder or the drugs or whatever, deep down i know it were my actions and my sayings that fucked it all up.

I know it may not be the best solution but i feel like killing myself would most certainly be ""the easiest way out"" for me.

Now I’m lonely, I’m a solider to my self, pride, status, something I fail to achieve my whole life, achieving to be a boy, the one my parents are proud of. The only reason I’m not forgotten is because I’m away from home, do you think they remember me? I’m so fine with being lonesome, I could live. I no longer cry, I no longer care, I’m not deep, I’m not feminine, I no longer attract you. I’m not part of them, or you, or your life. I’m not even an outcast, or part of the story. All my life, I thought of my self as the extras, in this story. But I realised I’m not even that, I’m so lonesome and not noticeable I could disappear right in this northern line, I carry everything  in onto me, try to care that I’m awake, but I remember everything. What have I become; maybe you could have it all; maybe you are the one, that make his memories, you’re unforgettable. You are the one, that’s not me. I’ve been forgotten, no presence of my own, the place I have for myself, have never been anything but death, and so it’s hard to imagine, a life where there’s lives. I’m apologetic towards the emotions regarding me, but I’m not sorry that I’m here.  Somethings in my way, it might be myself, never have I been so ill and treated at the same time

宝儿的一呼吸，几乎长过一年。现在居然明亮了；天的明亮，压倒了灯光

每一片希望的田野上都有无数的坟 
    每一个绝望的城市中都有无家的魂

小时候爸爸教我读武侠小说，大概也是个有侠气的人吧，可能他也做过那个梦，即使爸爸是律师，我仍然觉得他是个有英气的人，读书的人，读书仍然是让我骄傲的事。大概我对文艺片不感兴趣的原因如此吧，我对世间的感叹的大多来于痛苦与遗憾。并没有那么多浪漫和美妙，没有小小的惊喜和烦恼，只有沉重的负担。五年级的时候把家里顶端收藏的金庸全部读完了，还丢了几本。有几次电影迷问我，为什么总是在看犯罪片，恐怖片，可能我对普通生活没有什么幻想吧！我想飞在天上，喝着好酒，写写画画，隐居练功，一辈子不出来。

昨天爸妈又一次来电提醒我多给阿公阿布打打电话，可我不知怎么能说出口，我害怕打电话。我害怕又一次提醒自己，这段时间我错过的时光，外婆仅剩的时间。

等着你在我的世界里路。坐在空旷的轨道旁，今日来丢下工厂的布料，后天就是这边实习的最后一天。接着下一个毫无空隙。凉的风还挺舒服的，多云的阳光虽然不吸引人，但是对于伦敦来说已经很幸运了。静了下心，多久没有人问我的故事了？被动局面，我想要什么？

少小离家老大回，乡音无改鬓毛衰。
儿童相见不相识，笑问客从何处来。

Wrestling story line  

When I feel scared/ sad/ sorry about a story, I feel less that about my self today 

Wow, look at what u did today, look at how you feel. Look how easy It is to resolve conflicts, how easy it is to lie? Do that again I bet u

What happened that you are in a bad mood, are you reminded again that nobody cares 

Leading you to my story, opening my chest up with informations so little you barely understand. I’m here, waiting. What will it take for you to leave this time? I’m still right here. 

Puzzled 

I live in another house now, in another country. With a completely different routine and identity from my last one, and the other one. 


Out in this city for years feels kind of funny, I can’t tell what’s real and fake anymore. Did time really passed, do I even have a family , am I even here. 8 million people in London how do I always managed to find the most bat shit crazy ones to befriend?

you only, filling my free time with people, way to stoned to remember all of u. Forgetting yesterday just like I wanted, so lonely can I be yours? 

Fucking unmanageable, why do I always get into this messy situation, I can’t bare to work here anymore? I’m fine, but bitches who want me to fail will succeed, unfortunately I want to die 

Dead groom and corpse bride 

I can’t write anymore, no songs describe the desperate feeling for things to end, again. I kiss them the way I wish I was kissing you,  who are you though. 

Third time crying at the tube this week, I’m tired 

I wanted to ask the world, is it really a bad thing to die. I wanted my work to speak for me, speak for it self, so I don’t ever even have to talk. I wanted to make every work my last piece of work, becuz I could be gone anytime soon, I wanted every piece to be the final piece,

The finale 

Maybe this situation makes me feel safe, no attachment, no regrets. I never had to say goodbye to anyone, except maybe Lily and grandma and grandpa, and mom and dad. And maybe my therapist. If i die here in UK, I only want Lily to be at my funeral, literally if anyone else dare to show up I would haunt the fuck out of them for the rest of eternity. You were never here when I was alive fucking bastard 

Thanks to my grandparents I got that little piece of my childhood that I was genuinely happy, just that little bit of time in my life. Who would’ve know that be the last time I’ll ever be happy, I’ve only been happy once. This illness is for life, making peace that it might never get better. Thinking of bigger ideas, finalising my purpose. Stick to my self, strengthening my sorrow, smoking my thoughts away. Diving into these mens stories one by one, from my perspective, dying of thirst. Do you think they secretly categorises us, years I’m still the same. Out shining you , probably… at the bottom of my stash, damnnnnn I got options. I have a dream

My ultimate weakness is being fearless 

How come yesterday I was fine and today is another day of fucking it up 

Yesterday was a rebirth, I’ve lost him. Great, the move on period that I’m sadly familiar with, probably the only thing I know how to do. When I know exactly what to do, my path is clear and I’m brave, fierce. Today we begin the process, which probably started before I even knew it did, subconsciously, I never had him or wanted him in the first place. They’re right, it triggered me, badly, I wanted to die, now I want to live, at least till I get to go home. Non of this matters, at the end of the day I have to admit I don’t care about the superficial stuff, I care about the ugliness &amp; beauty we all are capable of. 

The ugliness that we are capable of 
Meetings by the pizza shop
AA 
NA
that I’ve never attended 
Bills I never payed 
Harmony that sounds heavenly good
Standing by my self, haunted by
I feel unstoppable, fucking fearless. I am ready

I want to hide in ur closet and cut open your wounds 

I can’t remember the last time i spent a proper holiday with family, I don’t really get sad anymore. You get used to it. And if you’ve spent holiday with my family you’ll be grateful to spend it alone. And again, me being me, I rarely remember the good times, I just know the bad. Maybe I get a little sad because even during covid people had the hopes of seeing their family this year, when I already know it’s not going to happen. I’m not scared to have nothing, and no one cares, if you have your last night On earth, who do you rather spend it with. I know it’s not going to be any family members, it’s luck to tolerate more then half an hr with them, ex’s? Not really. It’s the people that I don’t need to speak to, the people that know me by just one look, the people that really knows. I’m just describing my self, I’d probably want to be alone, for my last night on earth 

My stomach is always full, nobody ever gets killed. Everyone’s fine, life is pretty good 

Cutting open my wounds for show, watching you from a far I just can’t stop. It’s like I want to surgically remove you from my life, just cutting till I get you to leave me alone. I was trying to find comfort in you, now I realise I got that with everyone. 

Once you realise the concept of abuser comes from being a victim and then everything make sense now 

All I know my whole life is to be the other women. Just never the main one. About to make myself sad again

If he likes me he takes me home, put me in a box 

It is so weird to cum to pain 
Then why do we do it lol

Why do I do it
Enjoy 

Now I’m feeling really complicated about tattoos, because now I feel addicted this kinda of experience 

Lol had a massive break downs, don’t know how to feel about anything, let’s just wait a few days 

I just didn’t care what happens to me anymore, it just feels like an out of body experience, I’m still alive, but I feel dead. Feels like I’m no longer here 

So basically I never had a relationship 

I reminded him of his ex,
He reminded me of both of my rapist 
Someone put a spell on me, 

I’m in a secret place.. I’m having so much fun with my head, with my thoughts, it’s no longer delusions.  living inside my head, I just built our living room and you’re right there. You you you you you, him and him too! Stop, 
Stopppppppp, being an artist is not hard, stick that needle right through your heart. What I feel the best about? The blur is gone, been bothering my entire life how miserable I am? I couldn’t live with the fact that I was the only one, but it finally made sense. took me 6 years to realise, I was even raped. 14, just a little girl. To want, to know you were raped, took more then just time. I just didn’t know what was ok, because nobody ever asked, or when they do, I’m not even sure. I’m not even sure what I wanted them to do, to end this? End me? And this point on, I’m forever on my own, in my head 

Shhh, they don’t know I’m going to leave 

I’ve been so tired, crying almost everyday, it’s not hard to face the past, it’s just difficult to imagine how long it’s going to take for me to hide all this, so someone would finally want me. I need some help, I never satisfied them at all , why do some girls have everything I ever wanted in life 

He’s like drugs, I can’t get out. This feeling, I don’t deserve. I miss him, and I hate myself, I wanna leave him but I hate my self too much to leave, even if it’s fake I wanted someone to appreciate me for fuck sake 

It’s so bad, I just stopped caring about everything, nothing matters to me
Anymore.

Over flooded anxiety? Worry about the wrong thing. Think about bigger plans tho, but I can’t help but fuxking SCREAMMNMMM into the crowded bar god why, WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ficking 16 pounds to go home. R u serious 

Trying to keep my love life alive, I sat by the bar, dodging your eyes. Winking at you, fucking in the bathroom. how I wish I didn’t look at you, didn’t share that look, that moment I , I wish I didn’t drink. Running around town in the middle of the night, my heart is on the edge. Being alone, getting high on my own. Years later and everyone still left, am I even breathing. Do you want me or not.. just tell me if u do. He used to pick me up after school, boarding school drive way, I sneak back into my bed at 7am, hurting because I had to leave, crying because I’m already hurt. Now he picks me up after work, he said he’ll see me again, and I don’t even know why. Spilling my guts out in this note app, my own best friend hates me. The girl that I pour my heart into, she doesn’t even know me

I don’t remember much, about anything ever, I’m happy like that, if I remember all my feelings, it’ll be hard to get by. So dark blue, I wonder why I hear pictures. 

I’m gonna fly
But I feel small
I want him to tell me all his secrets 
Things you don’t tell anyone 
I’ll take it off you
Let’s me carry it for you
On my shoulder 
Very free 

I am the girl that things happen to. Why would anyone want to see the wounds that I carry, I hate to lie but I probably will disappoint him, exit is too late.

If I could just have a moment to breathe, please. Can’t take it much more then this, I’m taking my chances, not much more love left in this either. Did you just wanted to have fun, anyone can be my daddy today, he’s far far away, away from me. Have I told anyone, I don’t want to be the main one, it’s fun behind the camera, it’s safe being the stalker, I’m comfortable. Stood low, when I fall at least it won’t even hurt 
Liar
Liar
I’m going to keep it low this time, I’ll ease it in, but if this time goes, I’ll be okay too. I’m already broken, so what if I get thrown to the ground again. 
Every men has failed me, greatly. My girl and I, we deserve the world. I’m gonna kiss her forehead in my dreams, 

I’m going to hell

Just left his house, and he’s on his way to mine. Not sure which lie to tell, because when I  kill her in my dreams, you won’t have a friend to cook with. No one showed up, why can’t you be useful for once. Nothing scares me anymore, he invited me to a millionaires mansion, said we can do anything we want. Wild swim in a private lake, I said I might drown. 

Drown… and I want to die, and I want to lie. He knows about me, I am twenty, but like chains, I rust. You throw me to the ground again, pulling my hair, my heart shattered to pieces, he had no idea the wars I fought, and finally fight. I am a soldier far away from home, with no one to call, belongs to no one. I miss their forehead  kisses, 
solid as a rock shell,
each ringed a bell. 
But shamed me to hell, 

You call you called, 
He called as well, 

I miss my self, my old self, me as a child, I want her back. I’m going to have a kid, a little girl that I’m going to protect at all cost. 
我一句话都不想再说

All my life I wanted to be her, but who is she? It’s just who ever he actually wants, it doesn’t make sense. You know I won’t satisfy, don’t have the luck, going to suffer every way possible. Life turns into shit for my girls, but they’re laying under the sun, she’s having some fun, I’m picking up my ashes on the floor so I smoke it again. Luxury fine dining, cocktails every day, her hair is silky, when she gets hurt people fight for her. Is it wrong I hope she gets killed. 

Being bi sexual and a story teller means I make up plots and chapters, between whoever is making me jealous. It’s actually a really nice way to train my self from getting attached to anything at all, adding stories to peoples relationships gives me a deeper understanding of 

In a way, I no longer call my bad thoughts “putting my self down” if all my thoughts are bad, they’re no longer bad thoughts, they’re just thoughts? 

First and foremost, I’m going to write about you and your girls. This is my kind of fun,

I hope when I’m not around, she fulfil your voids, you can have both, My body, and her presence, 
we look alike don’t we? 
I’m in my own corner, the voices in my head says you’re alarmed. People says it’s impossible you’d be into me, I believe them. Why would you choose me of all people? I just can’t believe anyone would have anything to do with me - someone who just isn’t special enough to have anybody. I might be a little emotional writing this, missed my mood stabiliser again, it’s ok though, you can lay your head in my tummy, I bet it reminds you of hers. 
I have found my calling, I’m everyone’s girlfriend ❤️


Just ended things with you, 
Contagious 
Doing another test simply because I just don’t trust you, it is. My problem 
I should let you go, I know you’re no good but, you were at least nice. And no one have been nice to me in a while. 
Feels calm to think about how I’ll be safe and sound in my pain, another story to shoot, yeah it didn’t make sense to me but now it does. Love bombing didn’t work on me, even though I’ve been alone for a long time, thank god for putting me through shit early enough that I left early as well. 

My bad for thinking you knew better

I felt like a piece of shit again. Again 
I don’t give a fuck about any of you anyways but why I never know what am of you want or need, I don’t understand, I might be on the spectrum you know, I never communicated 

Flaws are just so deep, it’s like haunting through sleeps; am I the one stopping her happiness 

I never analysed why I did all those thing during elementary school, that my mom had to literally befriend my teacher to make sure I’m took care of. I was that troubled.

心灵之水无助地流尽”，“像一个坏掉的水桶”（第152篇），或者他的精神生活像“被掀翻的桶”（第439篇），那么阿尔瓦罗·德·坎普斯则宣称“我的心灵是往外倒水的桶”

对于像我这样活着却不懂得如何生活的少数人来说，除了将“放弃”作为生活方式以及将“沉思”当成命运外，还能做些什么？我们既不知道也无法知道宗教生活是什么样的，因为无法通过理性思考获得信仰，又不能相信乃至反对“人”这个抽象概念，而只能对生活进行审美沉思，以此来表明我们拥有灵魂。我们对整个世界的严肃事物漠不关心，对神灵毫无兴趣，鄙夷人类。我们徒劳地向毫无意义的感觉缴械投降，这种感觉经受过享乐主义的提炼和教化，适合我们的脑神经。 

    我将生活看作一座路边客栈，我不得不待在那里，直到马车从深渊开来。我不知道它将把我带向何处，因为我对一切都一无所知。我可以将这座客栈看成一座监狱，因为我不得不静候在那里；我也可以将它看作一个社交中心，因为在那里我结交了其他人。我既非缺乏耐心，也不是不会社交。我既远离那些闭门躺在床上、彻夜无眠等待的人，也远离那些在大厅高谈阔论、欢歌笑语飘然入耳的人。我坐在门边，耳目尽享声色景致，轻声吟唱——只有我自己能听见——作于漫长等待之中的缥缈歌曲。 

I think of all these intruder that entered my body without my wish, Kelly Moore’s dad - a white kindergarten teacher in a majority Chinese school. Felix, another white men that raped me unconsciously in the club. Naz, In which I still not entirely sure how I got lured into. I look back at my self, I sometimes wondered what went wrong, how I was made the best and then the worst. Why did I always had a bad time, why I don’t remember anything. Why and why and why did all this happened to me, I think I just had an over amount of change that now I need a giant break, but I don’t know how to relax. I love you, but who I need to love someone. Why do I do that? When I don’t know who you are I’m so stressed out. I can only move on 

Being rough was all I know, just people forcing themselves onto me all the time. Maybe why I thought zaineb was so special, and I’m not ready to have that again. Even thought Iain count as my first love, I think zaineb was when i completely trusted someone. I just feel wrong and not accepted I guess. 

I had another thought. All those time they’ve touched me, just touching me. Everyone, not just at the club, it be when I was getting take outs, shopping at the super market, I never said anything, why didn’t I? 

Every time I look in the mirror I see myself disappearing into a bubble, 

I wish I was brand new. I wish I was soft and clean, fresh off the boat too. I wish I still believed in the world and white men, 

世界上只有被奸污是不需要理由的。你有选择——像人们常常讲的那些动词——你可以放下，跨出去，走出来，但是你也可以牢牢记着，不是你不宽容，而是世界上没有人应该被这样对待

话是这样说但是真的如此吗

You guys are losing me bit by bits, day by day. Faded into the background, 我的丑陋被无限的放大了，没有理由的文字，怨恨我的一群人。背叛的不止是一点点

当我试着使自己的生活从持续不断压迫它的各种环境中解脱出来，其他同样的环境立即将我包围，就好像造物主的神秘之网总是和我过不去。我用力拉开扼住我脖子的一只手——我刚把陌生人的手从脖子上拉开，就看见我自己的手上有一根套索，而套索就套在我的脖子上。我试图小心翼翼地解开套索，它却紧紧地套住我的双手，我几乎要把我自己勒死。

我终究在为每个我接触到的女孩悲伤， 我不知道他们是谁，他们也不知道我是谁。我猜到接下来的剧情了，我懂的这些结局。想要告诉你，做好离开的准备。但是是不是只有我需要离开，也许他们值得留下

I guess for now, I know there’s more to life than romance and belongings. There’s knowledge and creation, story lines and peacefulness in nature. I realised that’s when I’m most allowed to stay, is when I realised I’m not rejected by the other side, I’m not rejected by hell. A place that’ll understand me, may devils protect me and be by my side. 

Gotta stop having death fantasies 

Must be a reason why I’m fortunate and not, is it karma or wealth. Abused or was I too spoiled to think I deserve happiness. Is it karma, or illness. It must be karma right

I know everything about you, 
I usually prepare my research before I meet you, a guy, anyone. I go through your family photos, your ex,  the girl you slept with before me, and potentially after me too. I spot for lies, matching the story you told me with evidences. The fun part is researching the girls you are fucking, I can feel my heart beat, Its like an electrical rush of anxiety. It’s quite an easy and intimate process, as I realised My instinct is right every time. By the way, This is the time where I note down possible events that might happen in the future, if this is torture then I don’t know what fun is. Solving this puzzle. I uncover every steps as I am walking through your living room, I give a fuck about you everyday. Ever since my first project 
I want to know everything, the truth of stories that’s happening to me. I need truth, I need clues, I need to find out if I’m the other women, why do you want to know things you shouldn’t know? Ugliest ugliest truth still better than lies. In my opinion. And when I learned the fact that I am nothing in your story, this is where I imagine love stories that involves the girls you actually like. Is this process psychopathic? I think it’s a poetic way of practicing being a wife.

Fuck u all 

Listening to he talk, as I sit there again and again, with my mouth shut, still tastes the cum in the back of my throat. We expect the extreme every time we meet, I always walk into your empty house - the house you shared with her for 3 years, convincing myself that I don’t care about you anyways. Ever since 14 I haven’t been able to learn, or live, I’ve just been getting by, and ruining my own life. Maybe it wasn’t even that traumatic but I had to have an excuse for something right, I guess I was pale and green.. I became dumb, never shared a thing, fell short when my friends are watching films. I watch now, I read now, I wouldn’t have done the same for him. Filled my life with horror, escaping intoxicated insane fucked so good, fun fun fun. You don’t know half of the shit I actually go through, you just think I’m a simple whore. I could be for you. I wear black tights and two silk bow ties on the tip of my knees, get all the way down I wait, they always tell me to stay where I am because my back is arched and my ass is in the air. All the things that made me who I am, I bet her art is even wholesome and not pain, then I worried I’m not urs enough 

Hey, I feel better now, still remember me? What you’ve been up to im not sure, writing you from afar. I’m just getting to know myself, why would I forget you, I was just trying to forget my self. I’m leaving London soon, just like how I left China, just like how I left LA, and like I left China again, when will I ever return. There’s no more looking back, my family’s fed and, I have some money under my name. The only fortunate thing little fire lit in my world, will never have the glory they once have, I’m not extraordinary enough but cool to have fun… recently my family discovered that I am American, a real American, a real person with a passport that doesn’t require 3 months of quarantine. A real passport that doesn’t need a visa, a real world. I’m freed, and you don’t understand, I’m trying to free my family too.

Come, I’ll swallow all the feelings you might have, may I open wide and welcome you inside up and down, spending time with men that wants anything but me. Ex and ex, never ending dark hole of a modern bitch, clear whiskey glass &amp; cocktails you never payed for her, spend it all on me.

It's been the heaviest thing to do when it comes to holding myself up. I had a hard 2020.. lost my brother best friend and stepdad to suicide and overdose. I thought I was ok I was so wrong. Wound up losing my job then my wife decided that she was better off with me. She is probably right. So all of 2021 I'm loosing everyone and every thing. Spouse lives we haven't spoke in over a year.

"I've expressed all my words on this post, I have no idea how to title this (LONG READ)"," 

I'm 23 years old, diagnosed with gouty arthritis at 22 and I've been battling with myself  for almost a year now and It has gotten to the point where I'm tired of living.

This Tuesday morning at 1:45 AM I tried to commit suicide. My second attempt on taking my own life in less than a year and yet, I’ve still managed to fail once more. I was able to get at least 2 hours of sleep but nothing more and that's the best I can get from a day. Just sleep. Wishing and praying to god to take my life every night, passing away in my sleep (best way possible imho)   

For the last few months I've been starting all my days and ending in tears soaking my pillow. I'm constantly emotionally unstable. I break down in the middle of my lectures and I'm genuinely tired of feeling sad and having different types of emotions on a daily basis. I’m lacking enormously in motivation to keep on living, my mind is a thinking machine and won’t stop thinking about all the suicidal ways I could end my pain.

Most of the time I ask myself, why me? I used to be an energetic kid who enjoyed doing many things in my free time. Mostly gaming all by myself since I never had an opportunity to make a solid friendship. So most of the time I end up talking/expressing to myself, because in this world there is no one here for me. **NO ONE** has ever cared for me or even shared the least tiny drop of affection towards my person. That's why I just don't try to make friends any more, because I feel like I'm a failure at it, and I don't want no one to invest time in me.

I currently have an absurd amount of hate/rage towards myself for not being able to finish everything. And not looking upon my flaws and imperfections and wasting the endless opportunities of improving myself. Now I'll just have to live with the consequences  and I’m just here in this world all alone thinking and knowing that **some** people are doing better than me and living their best lives and I envy that and I’m jealous of that.

I’m writing this deep down from a part of me that has just a millimeter of hope of recuperating, but I highly doubt I’ll be able to do it. I won't lie as of writing this, it feels like I'm getting rid of an anchor that has been pulling me back all this time.",SerpenNox,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tlwvug/ive_expressed_all_my_words_on_this_post_i_have_no/

Me being alive is fucking crime. I should just fucking end it now so nobody gets hurt from me. I’m sure my family won’t give a shit. They’ll probably be happier with the load off their shoulders.

How do I help him I’m so scared,"I’ve been with my fiancé two years.  We are both trans men in our mid 20s.  He has been severely traumatized and has PTSD.  For the past year, especially after starting a grueling job that takes up most of his time, he has become more and more depressed and suicidal.  He has a history of multiple attempts.  

I try to encourage him to talk, listen and validate, distract with humor and cheer, and offer ways to help.  I’m not perfect and a lot of times I think I just make it worse by doing or saying the wrong thing or just maybe how I am.  I’ve offered to pay for a hospitalization.  I’ve offered to help call for therapists.  I’ve offered to support him with savings so he can quit his job and take some time to heal but he refuses.  He won’t accept any financial help.  I argue that his health is more important long term than money for the future but he won’t accept it.  He can’t trust his family either.  He oscillates between desperately wanting mental healthcare and mistrusting it due to a totally reasonable reaction to past experiences.  Lately it’s just been so bad.  He is so dysphoric and every time he’s reminded of his appearance he begins to spiral, I can see it.  

Tonight he told me it’s been the same as long as he can remember, that he can’t enjoy anything, that he thinks about doing it every minute.  I listened and tried to comfort him and after a while asked if I can set a day to leave voicemails for some therapists.  He said ‘I’ve been trying to do that for the past two months.’  I said I would sit down with him to help tomorrow and he didn’t answer me.  He looked completely dead inside.  He told me he wanted to be alone and went to sleep on the couch.  He is asleep right now.

I feel like the weight of this is so heavy on me.  He is such a kind, loving, smart and beautiful person inside and out, the person I want to marry and spend my life with.  But I feel like that person is disappearing into a void.  A year ago he had so much life in his eyes.  

I have severe ADHD and anxiety and also am autistic.  I struggle a lot with executive functioning and forget important things constantly.  I think I might by nature be a bad support though I try my best.  I probably seem distant and apathetic often.  I will never give up on him but I’m barely capable of managing myself and I know I can’t handle this alone.  I know I should not have to but it is how it is.  It’s really getting to me and I have been becoming extremely depressed myself for the first time in a while.  

We are set to marry in under a year.  I think delaying the wedding might take stress off but it feels like any major change I suggest would freak him out.  I just don’t know.  Every time he goes out alone I’m worried I could lose him.  I make sure not to be overly invasive or anything.  If I called the hospital or his parents he says it would just make things worse.

"My grandparents killed themselves, my great grandparents too. I think they made the right choice.","They knew this life isn’t worth living, and gave all their possessions to their family. I want to do the same so my friends and family benefit from my death. I want to be dead, my family and friends get all my stuff, everyone wins.

I’m 100% fucking worthless and everything I consume is for no reason. Every friend and partner just stays with me out of pity and I want to pay them back.

Suicide hotlines are just more depressing with the same scripted words in between questions trying to find out where you are so they can call someone to your place. This is just going to lead to more frustration and probably huge hospital bills and embarrassment.

Thoughts are getting worse and I need help,"Sorry if this is kinda confusing and messed up I have a hard time putting my thoughts into words. I (18F) would sometimes get suicidal thoughts whenever I was going through a bad panic attack.. But after I calmed down those thoughts would just disappear and I was always sure that I would never do that stuff because I knew I only thought that as a quick escape from all the emotional pain and anxiety I was going through.

But today those thoughts wouldn't get out of my head and I'd find myself zoning out and planning on how to do it. I wasn't even panicking about anything, more like just feeling empty and depressed about my current and future life.

I've been fighting everyday to feel some genuine happiness in myself and love for others so I can stop putting on this fake smile so everyone doesn't worry about me. I miss it so fucking much and lately I've been getting sparks of those feelings again but they quickly dwindle away. But now with these thoughts creeping in I feel like this battle that I've been fighting for so long is pointless. I don't even see a future for myself. 

The people that I love in this life are slowly being consumed with negativity and become more and more toxic to me everyday. And I've noticed myself gaining that same negativity towards others and life. And while I know that they're probably going through some stuff and I have sympathy for them,  its draining me and I can't be around them any longer since they clearly don't want change. 

Lifes been getting hard for me and its sucking the light out of me. I don't know what to do about these thoughts but they won't get out of my fucking head and I'm scared they'll get even worse.

idk what to do,"So first of all i know that this is all fucking messed up, it is the way it is though. I've been depressed and suicidal for a while now and my ex knows that aswell. I promised him that I would never kill myself (which I really regret but whatever). I asked them a couple of times but they didn't want me to break my promise. And they also said if I did they'd commit suicide aswell. However now my ex told me that if I told my younger brother I was gonna do it, how and why it would be okay to break the promise. I just I can't I can't go to my younger brother, tell him ""hey I'm gonna kms bc life sucks and I'm just gonna hang myself"" . I know commiting suicide will hurt ppl around me but they will be fine. Except maybe my younger brother that's what I'm scared for. However it's so much worse though if I tell him I'm gonna end my life before I do it. He will feel so much more guilt and I just don't know what to do and everything hurts so much physically and mentally.",d3athwish7,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tld0an/idk_what_to_do/
just a rant,"I've tried, I've put in effort, I've fought back and I did get better before it all went downhill again til I'm back to square one. Then, still I got told to try and put in more effort to fight back, as if that wasn't what I have been doing to get this far, to survive this far. No matter how much effort I put, in the end everything came back to nothing. It's all meaningless. They would only see the result, without acknowledging nor appreciating the efforts. I'm too tired to fight anymore.
I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems; more like, I don't have anyone that I trust enough for me to really open up to. Even the friends I got right now, I can't feel a strong connection with them. I don't even talk much with them. Also too scared to even talk to a therapist and seek help. Having to reveal my problems like that makes me feel vulnerable, miserable and embarrassing. 
(Another reason for not seeking help is so I can break down even more until I really lose my mind and there'd really be nothing better than dying, I guess. But mainly, I hate the idea of having to reveal myself to others as I've mentioned just before this).
I've grown too tired. I've been spending a lot more time in my room playing games and barely doing anything productive outside of my work. I don't have any motivation or dreams. Sometimes I fear having to sleep at night because by the time I wake up, I'd have to go through another dull day again and repeat the same things over and over again. 
The problem is in me. I can't run away from myself. I wish I could just disappear from existence. And it'd be nice if no one would remember me at all. 
I'm going to sleep and I hope I won't wake up to greet another day, but I know that ain't gonna happen.

I Feel Like I Have no Purpose or Meaning and College is Making it Worse,"I want to preface this by stating that I haven't gone to anyone about this, nor have I attempted to get help. Realistically, it's just my mind actively stopping me because in some sick and twisted way, it believes that I'm okay.

I'm 18 and currently enrolled at Georgia Southern as a freshman. While I have struggled with mild depression in the past, it all really started going downhill when I lost my dog. In June of last year, my dog had to be put down and it was heartbreaking. I had to watch my parents and sister cry while I sat there trying to be ""strong"". I let myself fall into that typical stereotype that men aren't supposed to cry. I regret it. I wish I had shown some emotion then, but it's neither here nor there at this point. What matters is that she had been in my life since I was a kid. I grew up with her and it felt like my world crumbled beneath the weight of her loss. My girlfriend at the time helped me through it a lot and was an enormous amount of help when it came to my happiness at the time. It didn't last however.

I had reluctantly enrolled into college and honestly felt forced to go. The first two weeks honestly weren't too bad. I enjoyed my time and thought I would get through pretty easy. Then me and my now-ex broke up. This absolutely crushed me. Having my dog put down, being practically forced into college, and now I just got out of the first major relationship I've had, all within the span of 2 months. It was such a slow, but inevitable spiral into the worst depression I would ever face. My ex and I would continue having contact with each other for the rest of that semester. She tried to help me feel better, but I got so much worse. I no longer had a grasp on who I was and was just trying to stitch myself back together again. I never got better. I struggled for the rest of the semester. My grades were awful and my physical health had declined a good bit as well. When Halloween rolled around, I attempted to commit suicide. I took about half a bottle of Melatonin, which was me trying to attempt, but obviously that wouldn't work because it's Melatonin. I was a dumbass who was desperately trying to end it all with anything I could get my hands on. Well, I lived. Then November passed and it was finally December, a month I enjoy because of it's stress-free nature. Around this time, my Ex and I were actually recuperating. We both still had feelings for each other. While we never got back together, December was actually nice and I felt happy for the first time in a while. Then, December ended and the new year came along. I wanted to focus solely on bettering myself and although my Ex and I were starting to somewhat get along again, I wanted to cut off all contact. I wasn't good for her and she wasn't good for me, or that's what I believe to be true.

From then on, I focused on myself. I tried to be more sociable and tried to express my feelings more often to my friends. It was working, kind of. Towards the end of January, I attempted again. At the time I felt like I had made no progress and I thought I was stuck being a bad person forever. So I used some strong prescription pain killers (don't remember the name). I made it 2 pills in and vomited. Something must've clicked inside me because this was a turning point. The entirety of February was pretty good. I felt happy and I enjoyed so much of life. I talked to my parents about not wanting to do college and the fact that I broke up with my Ex (yes it took me 6 months to tell my parents, I was scared to). They were understanding and said they'd let me live there as long as I had a job. I also explained to them that I wanted to do something else in life then what I previously had said to them. I was majoring in Computer Science because I really wanted to be a programmer, but realized that I didn't actually enjoy it. I had tried to do some coding on the side and I just didn't have fun with it. What I did have fun with though, was Disc Golf. It was something that helped me feel better about myself because I was constantly improving. In particular, I had started to take it seriously around the beginning of January and by the time I talked to my parents I felt really confident and was thinking of going pro in the future. They shut it down because it's rare to succeed in sports and, if anything, it would be up to luck. After that entire conversation about me not being able to be who I wanted, I had signed a lease to live with my sister down near the college since we both go there. I did not have any intentions of going to school for a second year because it was not good for my mental health. I even told my parents that I didn't want to continue college, but they said that I HAVE TO because the rent where my sister and I are going to be living is ""too high to pay without a student loan"". Now I'm here, reluctantly signing up for classes next semester all while feeling I have no purpose in life. My parents won't support my actually dreams and would rather me find some 9-5 that'll at least keep me living paycheck to paycheck.

So I'm struggling to really know who I am still while slowing piecing myself together in an attempt to better myself. I'm having a shitty time in college due to several things dragging me downwards into depression. My parents won't support me in what I actually want to do and are instead forcing me to do a second year of school. I just don't have the energy or motivation to keep going. Everything is so extremely stressful right now and it's just been all one slow build up. My self image has absolutely plummeted and I'm ashamed to really even go outside anymore because I hate the way I look. I feel like I have absolutely no purpose anymore because of all the mixed messages I'm getting from my family. The only thing I don't have right now that I want, is a way out. I have Ibuprofen that I could overdose with, but I've looked it up and it seems too painful and it probably won't kill me. I have a car that I could crash of course, but I don't want to drag anyone else into this nor do I feel like it's reliable enough of a way out. I could try to drown myself in the lake on campus, but I've already tried drowning myself in 2020 and that didn't pan out well. I just want something simple and effective. I don't have the money unfortunately. I haven't found the courage/motivation to get a job.

Thoughts ebbing on wanting to stop existing.,"I've had thoughts of not wanting to exist for a while, but I've been very much in denial to myself and when spoken to by others about my desire to stop existing. I know I also make jokes on occasion and yet when I vent it's like I'm annoying the people around me or pushing them away because they don't want to hear about my problems, they want me to be a happy strong pillar for them who always listens when they need, not the other way around.   


I spoilered this as NSFW because it's for one, triggering, and for two I'd like for less people to see it on my profile.   


I just vented about one of the aspects of these thoughts on a shared space in the channel for triggering topics, but I think I want a new outlet just this once. I don't like relying on reddit for anything nor putting sensitive information out there, so there's a good chance I'll be deleting this post later.   


"" I feel like this might be triggering

But I just keep thinking of a sensory deprivation void that's just dark grey with no stimuli

and how without the need for sustenance after a while I'd start to fade and all brain activity would just shut off

And that's the sort of isolation that I keep wanting

No offending sounds, or smells 

No need to eat and no bodily functions

No pain of going without and no pain from my brain suffering the ill effects of my current lifestyle

It's an interesting artistic vision but I see how it's too much to share and possibly triggering to some

""artistic vision"" it's interesting when viewed through that lens I should say""

I'm not even 21 and I just can't do this anymore," know I'm severely depressed, but it's been like this for 7 years I can't do another 60 years of this. I turn 21 on Monday and I just so tired of this life already. I have 'friends' but there's no one I'm close to, no one to tell my day about (not that there would be anything to talk about i do fuck all, just barely surviving the day) Getting out of bed in the morning is so difficult. I watch my friends able to go out everyday, talk passionately about the things they're interested in, make plans for the future and I just wish I could do that. I genuinely don't enjoy anything. I'm doing a degree I hate but it's too late now to change it, and not be able to get out of bed to attend my lectures doesn't help. I'm on a waiting list for therapy but I'm number 31 so that could be up to a years wait. I've tried 4 different antidepressants and they have done fuck all. I just can't stop thinking about how it would be best for everyone if I got hit by a truck. I am draining to be around, I wouldn't be my own friend so God knows what anyone else thinks. 

My first thoughts about anything is negative. Someone asked me the other day what I want to do after university and I told them I want to be dead. Because in all truth that's what I want, I don't want to be alive. Someone wanted me to do something, and the first thing out my mouth was ""yeah well I want to chuck myself in front of a train but we can't always get what we want"", didn't even mean to say it but its just always at the front of my mind. And I don't even know if it's true, because I'm not at risk of doing anything. I've absolutely no intention of chucking myself infront of a train but I want to no longer exist. 

Sometimes I think I need to reach out to someone but who and why bother what are they gonna do. I went to my GP about it and spoke to a mental health nurse but all that's done is given me antidepressants that don't work and put me on a year long waiting list. 

I'm meeting up with family for my 21st, my and brother, aunts and uncles and cousins that I haven't seen in a while, all travelling to see me. I should be looking forward to it, but I'm not. I'm dreading it because they've all got their lives together, have something to live for. They're gonna ask me how I'm doing and either I lie (though they will know I'm not telling the truth) or I'm honest and bring the whole mood down. And what point would telling them, they can't do anything.

When I say I want to chuck myself in front of a train I'm not just doing it for attention. I don't plan to do anything of the sort but i think it's the only way I know of saying how I really feel because no other way describes it. Just saying I'm not doing great doesn't really cut it, I'm doing fucking awfully and don't know how to stop it",mccqe,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tlo9ue/im_not_even_21_and_i_just_cant_do_this_anymore/
please help,"my boyfriend and I have been fighting So. Damn. Much. It’s driving me mad. I love him but I can’t go on like this. He’s narcissistic, controlling, goes on power trips. etc. 

One time I told him about how I get thoughts to unalive myself. Fast forward (maybe a couple months) and he had the AUDACITY to tell me “why don’t you just go k_ _ _ yourself”. 

LIKE WHAT. 

He knows my past, my trauma, I’ve told him my triggers. Because of this, it makes it that much harder to open up about struggles/my mental health. 

For instance the other day I told him I miss how we used to text. (Having actual convos/interaction) and he took it as I was starting an argument, which I told him I wasn’t, just was saying how I felt. Well everyday after work (last 3 nights) it’s been hell. Him starting arguments, he packed all my stuff in trash bags and was going to kick me out. Over telling him my feelings, but then says I don’t communicate. This is the same guy that I’ve been with for a couple years. He says I’m pushing him away but he’s pushing me away, to the extent of even living. 

I feel like I’m going crazy, and I know I’m not. Please tell me I’m not. I’m just “tired”.

I fucking tried,"It hasn't gotten any better. I did it almost 2 years ago and the feeling of trying again has gotten worse. No matter how much I try, it's not good enough. I'm trying to go to school. I'm trying to find a job. I'm trying to shower more and blah blah blah. But no, I'm still too lazy, my hair is too greasy, I smell, I'm a fucking failure. Don't get why they act so much higher than me. You failed that exam, you got fired, you didn't do the school work.

How the fuck are you going to look at someone who can't afford all the things you have and blame them like it's their fault. No, I can't afford shampoo, no, I can't afford food, no, I can't afford a car or even the fucking lessons. We couldn't wash clothes for a week but I shouldn't smell. Sorry, let me pull out my imaginary washing machine, my imaginary money to buy a car, my imaginary money to buy the games you have, the food you have, the soaps and whatever the fuck else I don't have because I don't have the fucking money. Let's also forget the fact my parents haven't been working properly for almost 4 years and the amount of shit we owe which you don't deal with which is why you have all that shit. They look at me in disgust

""You should come out more"" ""You're just lazy"". You don't want me there anyway which is why I walk 2 metres behind, don't have proper conversations because you wont talk back or am completely forgotten about when you go out. 

I'm fucking trying. I do my best in exams, I do my best to shower often or to eat often or to get a job you just don't see that I live very different to you. I'm trying my best to not kill myself EVERY FUCKING DAY. The thoughts didn't just disappear when I got out of hospital, you know, the same place you laugh at me for going. The only reason why I don't jump in front of a car when we are together is because I don't want you to see the mess left behind.

Every day I feel worse and I can’t function at all at this point,"So Im depressed and right now I’m getting more and more suicidal. It started with intrusive thoughts, imagining myself in many violent suicide scenarios, but right now I’m seriously considering suicide, because it gets worse and worse and I have no idea when my life will improve in any way. 

I’m trans and I haven’t started transitioning yet, I don’t even feel like I’m living, I’m just wasting my life leaving as something in between, because I’m not a woman, but literally no one sees me as a man, even I myself feel like a joke instead of proper guy. 

Even when I’m not depressed it’s not like I’m functioning normally, I have adhd, with executive dysfunction as my worst symptom and I also have asd, so I always and up being awkward, or off, or not acting not properly in any social setting. 

I feel awful all the time and I constantly vent to my friends, even though, despite them sort off telling thats okay, I know how annoyed by this they are and how little they care. And even though I understand fully, I’m hurt by this, because almost every time when I’m available I’m listening and trying to give my best support if they need to vent, especially with one of my friends, we can end up on a meeting when 90% of the time she’s the only one talking. But when I message them anything (I know I do that a lot, but still) even if they even bother to read it I usually get one word responses or just sad emojis. 

I don’t know, I just every day feel like there’s less things important for me to keep going. The only things that kept me from even considering suicide as some real option, was vision of starting my life as my true gender and not wanting to traumatise people close to me. But transitioning seems like it won’t happen anytime soon and every day spent in my body feels like hell (I’m not even exaggerating, I get constantly flight or fight response triggered by my own body). And with people close to me, I’m getting more distant from them every day. Most of the time I don’t have energy for anyone, but when I sort of do, I’m still super irritable. I just got super distant from my friends, I feel that I know nothing about most of them and the closest ones are just annoyed by my constant low mood, or I’m annoyed by them feeling like they need to criticise my behaviours, like smoking or not being able to motivate myself to do things. I won’t even start talking about my ex, he just makes my day worse just by being around me and that’s all the time. 

I don’t know I just feel like no one cares about me in a meaningful way. My friends either criticise me, or give me meaningless support. My parents don’t take my issues seriously, they literally wanna take me of all my meds in about two months, which would fuck me up, because it would mean no more focus on anything (lack of adhd meds), no more sleep (some anxiety meds that I use for my sleep troubles) and I would quit my antidepressants, which I started to take in less than two weeks ago. My psychologist is caring about me only because she’s paid and even though I like her, she’s still isn’t able to help me and I’m still not able to open up to her, either cause of fear of being honest about my feelings or because of my shitty memory that causes to remember me all the wrong things at the wrong times. 

I feel like this mini personal hell won’t end soon and even if it will, it won’t mean that all my issues will go away. I’m stuck with being trans, awkward and having adhd for the rest of my life, no matter what I do. And I don’t want it to be this way.",nothinkybrainhurty,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tld0mw/every_day_i_feel_worse_and_i_cant_function_at_all/
why do you want to stop me?,"what’s the actual point of stopping me from doing this, it will allow a person who is suffering to not suffer any more, i don’t want to do this any more, it’s a never ending battle and i’m tired, say i’m a quitter, i don’t care.

why do you care about the life of a person on the internet, who will never contact or see you, who you, for all means, should not have any personal connection to you, yet people still care to tell me to stop when i’m that close to stopping the pain.

at this point, i could care less about most of my family, most of them are why i want myself dead anyway. my friends would read the note i’d be leaving and understand why i did it.

When I woke up I was really depressed. I didn't want to go into work. I wanted to lay back down and go to sleep and hang out with him again.

Planned suicide,"I have had suicidal thoughts since high school. I am also trans and have always known it since I was young. I never felt it was something I was allowed to do. I started transitioning a few months ago now at the age of 23.

I’ve attempted suicide 3 times in my life, and I did the least almost hoping I would live or die 50/50.

I’ve always threatened my family that I would kill myself. Some of that was a cry for help, some of that is true. 

I have planned to live perhaps 5-6 extra years to see if truly as everyone tells me “it’s worth living just wait. I believe in my heart I can be great for myself and love myself, and yet I am plagued by this obtuse feeling of letting go for good, almost every day. 

I have had many therapists. I have one currently. I have tried meds and I truly don’t want them in my life. 

I can’t even complain, I speak 5 languages fluently, I’ve experienced a lot of life and always felt like an old soul. Although I am disappointed with this world. I am disappointed with all the hate that exists, I’m disappointed with myself and others consistently. 

Most days I wake up grateful and most days I go to sleep angry, sad, lonely and hopeless. No matter how much I try to be a force of love and light in this world in the morning, I end up depleted and sucked into the darkness each night.

I have stayed for my family and friends who would suffer if I left. I have never once stayed for myself. I wish I found a reason to live for myself and not for others.

I’m planning on taking shooting lessons in this year so I may get a gun license. Hopefully so that I may register a firearm in 5-6 years and kill myself.

I hate myself and I don't think I'll ever stop, I'm tired of stressing them out or bringing them down by existing. 
The cool thing about being dead is people will almost always remember the good things about you and maybe they'll talk about how you struggled but it'll sound romantic and not nearly as disgusting as it actually feels.

Why does it have to be so attractive? Objectively speaking there's nothing sexy about about coming across the news(in whatever form) that a loved one has ended their life but here I am fantasizing about how I'll just stop being and I'll be just that more loved without having to do anything but die.

Loving someone hurts you.,"My story is NOTHING compared to everyone else here...It's such a stupid reason to post, i know, but i still wanted to say it. Please hate on me if you'd like, cause i deserve it. Theres this girl i recenetly met from my college program for 2months so far. Obv with everything being online, I have only met her irl once at school but i have severe social anxiety and always have been an introvert since I was in like middle school so...i couldnt talk to her that day. I actaully even purposly avoided her because I DONT KNOW WHY. We also live far away from each other with the college being 2 hours away for us both, but for each others houses its 4 hours. So this would be a long distance relationship if i ever asked her out which I never will, but its an idea :) Before i met her, i was always sad with my life, not studying, playing games all day, not going outside, eating unhealthy, spending money unwisely, no friends, and also with my parents not caring about me or talking to me at all so i was alone and lonely. I was actaully thinking about killing myself because i was just so done with life and thought there was nothing left to do in life, but literally right after i was thinking about suicide, i met her. After meeting her I have been eating healthy, studying with her, playing games with her, exercised because she told me to, and she is just someone i can always talk to. We basically talk to each other everyday with over 1000 messages and she is really a joy to talk with. Ive never really liked anyone this much in my life, shes just perfect, shes funny, kind, beautiful, thoughtful, trustworthy, sweet, list goes on. I like her TOO much and its now starting to affect the thoughts in my head. Im constantly thinking everyday how im unable to always be beside her, how we will only stay as friends, how we cant ever hang out together like friends normally do, me not being able to say a word in front of her irl, it just makes me so fucking sad. Im such a fciuking loser and i hate it. I hate anxiety, i hate depression, i hate my life. Ive grown too attached to her and I just cant stop having these thoughts in my head...Im also mad ugly so im also insecure about that....Im back to being suicidal but idk yet.  


Today......we had an in-person lecture that was mandatory and i sat in the corner as i always do, far far away from the people, and she came in and sat right beside me. I shouldve been happy, i should have been gratful that we could be together in that short moment, but my anxiety got the best of me and i ran away from her....Left the class, left the school, and went back home.......When I came home i saw so many messages she has sent me, and i havent replied yet nor have i looked at it.

I just want to be enough. I just want to feel normal. Doing the simplest thing like breathing fills me with dread and worry when I’m around others. I’ve never had a super close friend. Though I never really got out as a kid. I never really felt understood. I find it hard to believe that one day I will feel comfortable with myself because this feeling has plagued me ever since I was a child. I look forward to when I sleep because that’s when I’m not limited and I feel free. The thought of dying painlessly and giving into the void is what soothes me when I’m stressed or sad.

feeling quite obsolete,"tagged nsfw; tw mention of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts

the idea of suicide is comforting. it is all that i’ve known. the idea of ending the constant misery i feel is weirdly enough the only thing stopping me from doing it (besides a select number of friends), as it truly is comfortable to me to be sitting in the cesspool of apathy and hatred for myself i feel every day.

usually when i’m depressed i feel the apathy and it slowly just turns to numbness, but something is different this time around. do you ever feel almost the thrill of suicide? or, rather, do you ever almost feel excitement when you’re done grieving what your life could/ would have been? lately, i’ve felt at peace over my self-grieving and i do not like that, as i have been desperately trying to stay afloat and the tiny push i would usually give myself to ground myself is gone. i’ve only ever felt this rush when i attempted and the aftermath destroys me every single time. this feeling is almost like some time of euphoric high that i cant stop chasing. i hate my life and i hate feeling like this, but aren’t some people meant to be dished the worst cards to balance out nature?",assholemilker,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tl1o4w/feeling_quite_obsolete/

Indifferent if I die or not. Maybe I'd get a pity ""aww"" like if a friends family member died. You don't know them, you just say aww out of sympathy. Sometimes I want sympathy.

"Even when things seemed to be getting better, it all went downhill again","I’m a frequent poster here. I’ve struggled all my life with these feelings. Things seemed like they were getting better, I was genuinely happy…and then it got taken away again. 

I live in shitty section 8 housing. I was kicked out several years ago and I’ve been struggling to stay afloat since. My mother and i recently discussed me moving back home, which was less than ideal…

She bought a condo, and offered it to me, she even suggested I get a roommate. I was overjoyed. My SO could move in, my best friend could move it, it seemed wonderful. And then, once I already signed the papers to move out in two months, my mother told me to stop looking for a roommate. She has been considering moving into the larger bedroom and taking my kid sister with her, leaving me alone in the smaller bedroom with no support. And I have no place to argue against this. 

She bought me a new car as an early birthday gift, she’s paying for me to go through school. I’m currently struggling to keep my grades up, and she’s rightfully angry about it. My apartment is messy, and she’s mad about that too. Rightfully so. 

I am going to lose my privacy and be stuck in the tiny condo with her, without support from my SO and my best friends. My mother is very controlling, so I know I won’t be able to play video games or talk to my friends in peace. It’ll just be lecturing; do your homework, look for a better job, etc etc. 

I don’t have the motivation for either. I barely have motivation to go to my current job. She doesn’t get that. I’m so incredibly depressed and suicidal every single fucking day. I just got rejected for a better job. And now on top of all that, I’ll be stuck in a confined space with her, with no freedom again. And I’ll probably become babysitter again for the child I pretty much raised for her.

I don’t know,"Idk, I guess this is a vent or something but whatever. 
Lately, everything has been okay. Like daily wise. School is okay I guess. Just wish every math lesson didn’t either leave me with a headache or panic attack. Slamming doors and yelling just remind me of my childhood and always sends me into a panic attack. Today I had two in different classes. I’m hard of hearing and I have hearing aids. I wish that i could turn them off or take them out whilst the yelling and shit was happening but I’m always in that state of freeze and panic. I’m the new kid, no one seems to notice it which is fine. Home is okay. There is just court and custody shit going on since my mother and father can’t make one agreement. Now me and my brother have to go to court and get like attornies or some shit like that to settle it down. I don’t know. I’m exhausted. I don’t feel like living rn. I feel like everyone hates me and is drifting away and I can’t handle that. I’m clean of self harm. Though I’m probably gonna break that after this post. I’ve been thinking a lot about offing myself.

Hesitant about telling therapist about suicidal thoughts,"My depression has gotten much worse lately, but I haven’t told anyone how bad it is. Not even my wife, because she’s still grieving her mom who passed away last month and I don’t want to add to her troubles. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts again, but so far no intent to actually end my life. However I have relapsed into self harm again, and I think it’s worse than it has been before. Like, I can’t end myself because my wife and kids need me, and I’m now the only income earner in the house so I need to provide for my family, so I’m doing the next best thing and hurting myself. 

Thus why I’m hesitant to tell my therapist how bad it’s gotten. I’d voluntarily committed myself a couple years ago when I was suicidal and told my wife, so I know how that goes. But I know there is a risk that if my therapist thinks is dire enough, I can be involuntarily committed. And I can’t afford to miss any work right now. I don’t know what to do. I know I don’t have a lot of time to decide because my next therapist appointment is in a few hours.",regularguy86,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tktqv9/hesitant_about_telling_therapist_about_suicidal/

I’m going to kill myself in 30 minutes.,"I just bought 80 paracetamol, a 350ml bottle of vodka and some Coke to balance it out. I love my mom. I feel like shit, this happened like 2020-2021 but my crush at uni played me, flirted and cuddled with me for two days only to fuck another girl right in front of my eyes and after chasing him and being rejected I got bullied by our friendship group. Everyone cut me out and stopped talking to me. He fell in love with me after I told him something private and made a playlist with songs about me on his phone and I fell into a psychotic episode right in front of him. I believed I could use telepathy to communicate with him. I was fully convinced he was on heroin and took heroin for me because I’d hear other thoughts inside of my own head. I’ve never loved anyone the way that I loved him and he’s verbally told me to fuck off and that he doesn't want anything to do with me. It kills me to know I’ll never be with him when I could have. University was my last opportunity and the psychotic episode I had led to me fucking it all up, I ended up dropping out and spent 4 months in the psych ward and nothing will ever feel the same again. I’ll never have children or get married because I have Asperger’s so I fake my way through any and all conversation. I lie and hide and smile but I don’t have anything to say. I just wanted to tell at least one person this, I’m going to kill myself and this is the end.

Worried wife of a suicide watch,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to go to but I don't know where else to go. My spouse has struggled with severe depression his whole life. It is genetic, his dad was the same. Any amount of pressure makes him worse. He constantly feels as though life is not worth living and he's a lost cause, he will never feel okay and just wants the pain to go away. We have a baby coming any day now and I was worried that pressure was gonna send him over the edge. We have been talking about having him voluntarily go to a psych ward and see if they can help, kinda as a last ditch effort before I just give him permission to end it.. 

Today he talked to his counselor about going to one in a few weeks after the baby was here, and they came and picked him up an hour later. He is pissed, doesn't Want to be there, which I understand Is normal. He feels completely betrayed by his councellor and never wants to go back. I'm worried that now he is going to pretend like he is fine just to get out. The point of this is to get help why won't he just take it? I'm scared the mental hospital won't help at all. I just need you guys who have been there before to be honest with me. Did it help? What things helped and what made it worse? If it does help or when he comes back home, what are some things I can do to continue the healing process, or just make his life easier? Anything else you feel to share please do.

Seriously considering suicide any nobody has noticed,"TW: for self harm, abuse, and suicide
For the past 8 years i’ve suffered with severe depression from family genetics and other issues. As a young kid death wasn’t really my first thought it just kind of started appearing after a bit. When I was in middle school, my close friend sexually assaulted and abused me for a year and a half. They also psychologically manipulated me and abused me in ways that I’m shocked they got away with. I have made around 13 failed suicide attempts in my life time. Only one has been severe enough to end up in a hospital because I told people but realistically there’s several more that I should have been taken to a hospital for as they probably fucked up some stuff internally. I form really strong and probably toxic bonds with people to the point where if I think I will be left I try so hard to keep them around that it can be overbearing. I’ve gone to therapy since I was in elementary school, and I’ve done DBT and CBT intensively. I have definitely gotten better but the fact that any time someone leaves me I feel so distraught that killing myself feels like the only option. My partner and I broke up at the end of January and it has more or less destroyed me. I lost my virginity to them, and the breakup came out of the blue. They said we could start talking again when they felt like it so I have left them alone. I was being weird about saying hi so I tried to do that some more and I was feeling better about moving on and staying friends in the future. I really haven’t been feeling better, I still wanted to die, but I was managing it pretty well. On Monday, at midnight, they sent a text saying they “wanted to give me closure” and that they never actually wanted any sort of relationship after and oops sorry about the confusion. I’m not sure why they sent that, we haven’t spoken in almost 3 months, there has been no communication and I only told two people how I was secretly hoping things could be patched up. Everyone else who asked I had just said hopefully we can remain friends in the future. I know not everyone wants to stay friends but they were the one who proposed it. That sent me on a spiral. I broke 4 months of self harm, ripped off my fingernails in stress, and haven’t eaten correctly since. Realistically, if this is going to be my response to every breakup or conflict how can I keep living like this? I don’t want to end my own life, since a 14th failed attempt would be embarrassing, but I also don’t want to be here anymore. Everyone tells me that in a few months I get to move to my dream town so it’ll be fine but really I don’t care about that. I can’t handle the pain now, and knowing I’ll have to have it possibly many more times is excruciating. I feel like I could have been a success story, but realistically, if it’s been so long and I’ve only barely gotten better, then what’s the point. I’m trying my hardest to find reasons to live right now, but I don’t have much to care about.",Ok_Cheesecake_7101,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkw8h4/seriously_considering_suicide_any_nobody_has/

I just want it to be over,"My life is a total shitshow. I had an abusive childhood -  physical, mental and emotional abuse, complete neglect and ignoring from my father and overbearing manipulation from my mother. Religious abuse because of the way I was raised. I was sexually molested in high school.

I went from that life experience straight into unexpected motherhood and eventually a marriage that quickly became toxic, but I loved him so much that I couldn't even acknowledge the abuse that was happening.  2 more kids later, I watch them living through their own childhood hell and I tried so hard to fix everything, but it just kept getting worse. Being used, worsening mental and emotional abuse, trying to carry the demands and unhappiness of someone who refused to get help for their diagnosed mental issues and I began losing myself in my.own anxiety and depression.

After 17 years of escalating mistreatment and abuse my husband told me he wanted a divorce. The following months were a nightmare, I found out  he was cheating on me and went through more abuse during the process of separation. I fell completely apart emotionally and began having multiple panic attacks a day, i couldnt eat or sleep. I had 2 heart attacks brought on from the stress. My husband was still living in our house at the time, but didnt even show concern or acknowledge that i almost died, i was back at work the following monday. He took all the money and spent what little i made, at times I couldn't even feed my kids, my daughter was buying food at school so she and her younger brother could eat. I fought tooth and nail for my marriage, trying so hard because even though he treated me like shit, he was my world and I loved him. He had been my rock throughout my teen years  helping me get through the abuse and trauma at home, only to become the same type of father himself. I tried to help him, to help my kids and i loved them all with my entire being, trying to be the glue that held us all together. But I couldn't fight the inevitable. My entire life was torn apart. He divorced me, leaving me with our traumatized, suffering kids and our broken down house  to assuage his guilt. 

I sought help because i was self harming and suicidal, i was diagnosed with a slew of mental conditions, including depression, anxiety and PTSD. I was not a functioning human being for at least a year, I barely remember that time of my life other than the agony and feeling like a walking corpse. I mourned the death of who I had been. 

The last few years since then have been nothing but struggle too. My house had already been falling apart, but things just kept worsening. Electrical lines not working, that meant no oven, full size refrigerator or dish washer. No air conditioning. No heat. No hot water. A pool that is dilapidated and looks like a swamp. There are so many issues with the house and I can't afford to fix them  those are just a few. None of the paperwork was filed by my ex either so although it's mine according to the decree, it's still listed as legally his. I pay a mortgage in his name. I can't afford to change things with a lawyer. I make so little money I can't keep my head above water to even keep our basic needs met. And even though it costs too much, my mortgage is still cheaper than the cheapest 2 bedroom apartment anywhere near me. I cant sell it because its in his name anyway. My ex is no longer in our lives. I'm trying to find a job that pays a decent wage but I have no college degree. I need to make at least 55k to be able to make it and I've applied at literally hundreds of places with nothing but scams replying positively. My relevant work experience is over 15 years ago and my current job has literally zero room to grow or increase income. I hate my job.

My kids are mostly grown but still live at home, my daughter is in college, she took out loans and scholarships. My oldest has his own mental issues that prevent him getting a job, my youngest is in high school. I've filed for forbearance and now am thousands behind on the house. We are of the brink of losing everything if I can't pay it all back, because the loan can't be modified since its in his name and i can't refinance without an up to date loan. Within the next few months we are facing possible homelessness.

In the last couple years I met a guy who I am close to, although we are long distance. I fell for him hard, and he encouraged me in my feelings, but ended up basically leading me on. I got my heart broken again. I hadn't thought I could care for someone again after all I had been through, but being burned again, especially from this man has left me with ashes instead of a heart. Yet I can't turn off how badly I just want to be loved, and how much I care for him. He's still in my life as a friend but it's painful. My heart is just so far beyond simply broken I don't think I can ever recover after all I've been through.

It seems like almost every day something else goes wrong, things break at my house, not small things, major ones, today it was my daughter's laptop that she needs for school and me losing my next to last pair of contacts that I can't afford to buy more of. Just when it seems like things might not improve but at least be okay, something else happens that knocks us down even further. I'm working 2 jobs but we are bleeding money so badly I can't keep up and I am just so tired of trying to exist. I hate my life, the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my kids. I love them more than anything and i feel so awful for feeling this way when  i know how much they love me and how i love them. I'm terrified of slipping back into self harm. I cant cope, I'm in excruciating emotional pain and the stress is overwhelming. I have panic attacks, I can't sleep. I've had to stop buying my medication because my daughter needs it more. My sons could use mental help but I cant afford it. 

I just need to vent, to scream that I am not okay, that I can't make it. I'm so tired, so tired and I just want it all to stop. I just want the nightmare of my life to end. There is no more light to be found. The light at the end of the tunnel really is a freight train in my experience. I am broken, lonely, unhappy, in complete despair and I feel worse than beat down, I feel like roadkill. Like im crushed and lifeless and not even reconizable as something that was once alive and yet still the tires come to grind me deeper into the pavement endlessly. I feel worthless. unlovable. hopeless. Oddly enough I still volunteer at church, but even though I still go and serve there I don't believe any of it anymore because my life has been so bad for so long and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Not for days, or weeks or even months or years. Literal decades of trauma, a lifetime of it and still it gets worse. I dont know how to keep going, every day it's harder and harder 

I'll probably delete this because I already feel so exposed, but I just needed to try to get it out

I feel like killing myself everyday,"Everyday at some point I get this overwhelming urge to kill myself. Sometimes its when i wake up sometimes its when i fall asleep sometimes its in the middle of the day, there is no rhyme or reason to the timing. A year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problems on top of his own. I keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it gets deeper everytime i do it. I feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university. Its just so hard to convince myself to do anything as nothing is fun anymore. I used to love playing games but now that is boring and lifeless. My dad thinks i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feels so difficult. I feel like im a terrible person who abuses others for emotional gain as i will often make requests of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing things that inconvenience me. Ive been trying to do better but everytime I seem to improve i come back worse than before. I think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite. I feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place.

What more can be done?,"Hello, I (f23) have told all my friends &amp; family i’m in a dark place. I just started treatment with a therapist &amp; am meeting a pcp soon. I am on a personal leave from work to deal with these personal issues.. 

It was tough, but I have been transparent with my support system (family/friends) that I left an abusive relationship &amp; I am deeply ashamed that I almost did not leave. I left my home &amp; family for 6 yrs &amp; lived with my partner in another state. I just moved back in with parents- grateful but struggling to adjust. 

In my heart there is shame knowing that I only left because he admitted he did not love me for the past 2 yrs, not because it was an abusive relationship &amp; I nearly died.. i couldn’t &amp; still can barely see past the love I had for this partner &amp; grasp that it was abusive. 

My trust was betrayed so deeply from this 6yr relationship. It was as if a switch had been flipped &amp; the person I believed I was in a mutual loving relationship with was suddenly gone. I was treated so callously by my partner. 

I know this is simply how the world is &amp; I need to come to terms. But.. Now I struggle with depression &amp; anxiety with every relationship in my life. I am utterly terrified to trust even family &amp; friends. but i have been high functioning- forcing myself to be active &amp; social. My family &amp; friends have been here for me, bringing me back from the ledge &amp; encouraging positive outlets like socializing with friends &amp; working out. 

I am scared, because all I can think in the moments of stillness is, “What is the point?” For now, the point is to keep pushing on for family &amp; friends because I do not want them to have to live with my death if I committed suicide. I feel like I am on borrowed time &amp; my excuse for sticking around will soon mean nothing.. 

My cup is so low, I just want to sleep all day &amp; not wake up. I’m terrified. I want to be okay. I don’t know what else to do. I hate putting the pressure on my friends &amp; family to pull me back from this metaphorical ledge.. i know they love me &amp; they have told me I am not a burden.. I cannot shut out that voice in my head saying I am being a burden. I should just be strong, get up, and &amp; move on. I just want to be able to be fine again. 

Can anyone help me by suggesting resources that I have not already exhausted or by answering the question, “what is the point?”

My sibling shared that personally his point/purpose in life is to spread positive energy &amp; change with each person he interacts with.

my psyche is a deep mess,"(I wont do anything because i fear hell, but, still.)

I cant really explain anything about what i feel, think or who i am.

Since a kid, ive felt like everything is a fever dream, where im being carried by something else, that i dont really have control over where i end up, where i am at a point in time. You ask me the types of questions that relate to the my idea of myself, and i lose myself and paradoxical thoughts and incoherent ideas.

I feel sad, happy, suicidal, overly optimistic, manic, confident in different points in time, like random.

due to this tortured Psyche, i tend not to know why. Why? is the biggest description of my life.

I dont why im writing this, i dont know if i want a solution for this. I dont why i want to know why.

Those paradoxes of hope and despair makes the idea of ""just be yourself"" a death sentence for myself.

Ive pushed many away because of my mind baggage. And this regret makes me rather troubled. I am social (mostly from a intense desire to conduct and use all my mind nonsense energy into talking), talking to people, no biggie, but when i start getting close to someone or i start liking them, a timed detonation starts, that i dont know the countdown of. Eventually i will realease my mind onto them, on that point in time, the relationship wont be the same, some people like me for this (The existencial despair of my mind is very funny when you hear it talk), some just stop talking to me, some want to passionately help me save me from myself, to be a mentor. Recently i have to really control it. 

I dont know to what point im getting too, i just forgot half of the things i was gonna say.

Eventually, what im feeling right now, (a mental breakdown i think, maybe, i just feel all the paradoxes getting into a boiling point). Will reach a limit, usually i start getting into suicidal thoughts (not because i hate the world, or necessarily hate myself, my life.etc Is a strong feeling of wanting to go away to a better place, to see the beautiful things of a different world, to reset my reality, to get out of here, to end my mind, to end my happiness and my sadness), my mind suddenly calms itself, the fog suddenly clears, like body saying, ""you wont die"". I am left wondering ""what was i even thinking about?, i just wasted my time"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then the cycle starts again.

I love circles.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to this my mind wants to end its own thinking, meaning that i tend to seek mental damage. 

(Note: you can see how this is a problem for romantic relationships, i mean, no one wants to deal with a man with deep mind issues, im willing to accept that i will live and die mostly alone, with no meaningfull or deep friends except my family, right now and in the future, i will have friends and such, allways, im not a loner on earth, but a loner on my reality)",xc_LOLAZO_xc,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkv4q1/my_psyche_is_a_deep_mess/

"Welp, contacting the crisis hotline didn't work out well. TLDR at the end.","While I wait for my school counselor to give me an update on the whole online school therapy thing, I was convinced to check out a confidential, free, and text based crisis hotline. It's apparently designed for teens like me who have noone in their life that they could talk to. Now, for me, personally, my experience was subpar.

I don't want to disrespect the volunteer work there, but after the 2 successful attempts, one in the morning and one just 3 hours earlier, I felt like I was just a number on a waiting list. The system constantly kicked me out of the conversation, and the one time I actually had a decent conversation, it felt like they were trying to cast me aside as quick as possible. 

As soon as I mentioned that music helps me organize my thoughts at times, they told me to just listen to music and the conversation closed immediately after. Maybe I'm stupid, or maybe it's just my anxiety and paranoia, but they seemed annoyed. I guess it would help to say what I was expecting.

I was thinking it would be a deep dive into why I feel the way I do, but it was more just a short session of giving me a metaphorical ice pack and sending me home with an old, stale lollipop. If I didn't feel worthless enough already, then well...

As for the 2nd ""successful"" attempt, it was even shorter. They asked me how I was feeling, they asked a question to confirm what I said, I answered, and then the very next message was telling me that I must've stepped away and that the conversation had been closed.

The automated reply also hit me with a stinger saying ""you matter."" It doesn't feel like it. It doesn't help that I had to reply ""STOP"" over and over because I kept getting auto replies from the bot.

Needless to say, I have less faith that online school therapy will even put a dent in how I feel.

I was so excited to start college too, but now they’re trying to talking to school admin about this. They have 0 proof so I don’t think much will happen.

A Failure and a Felon,"I was a good kid. Class President, one of those pesky Mormon missionaries after highschool, on scholarship, etc. Then at 22 I snapped and went to prison... for ten years. I vowed to overcome it, got out, finished college and married. Less than five short years of being free, I threw it all away and went back for another 5 years on a parole violation, finding out that week that my poor unsuspecting wife was pregnant with our only child.
I struggled through five more years of incarceration, dragging my entire family through the nightmare that is the criminal justice system again, while my now ex-wife struggled to have our baby and support herself. 
I've been free again for under two years.  I'll never have a good job, I see my son for two brief hours a month and he barely knows my name. My family who was heavily involved in his life while I was incarcerated, is now prevented from seeing him or even knowing about him for my ex. Everything I have is because of the charity of others and I've earned nothing on my own other than disdain.
The direction my life took was unexpected to everybody. I was expected to be so successful. But here I sit, 42 years old, with no hope of a meaningful life. 20 years gone in the blink of an eye. Hell, as a felon many people would just prefer I was dead anyway. 
To look at me you would never know that all of this is in my past. The only friends I have are people I've met online who don't even know my real name, as all of my old friends have long since moved on with their lives.

My life has became a mess and I'm ready to end it (TW: rape),"Hello. I am 18 years old and a senior in high school I also have ADHD and autism. I have been suicidal twice before (6th/7th grade and 10th grade). But this is possibly the worst it's been.

The disaster started back in September when I got diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called nf1. Everything I have heard about this disorder from doctors and online sounds fucking horrible and nothing I want to live with. 

Then in October I met my first girlfriend. So I was happy for a bit but if course that went south too, I'll just get right to the point. When the relationship started I made clear to her that I didn't want sex and she agreed. However later that same month she talked me into it. In November/December she asked for it multiple times a day and guilt tripped me when I said no. She made me feel horrible when she did this. Then in January I was saying no repeatedly and she just pulled my pants down and started riding me even though I was trying to push her off and safe-wording. I broke up with her in February but there's been drama and social bullshit ever sense.

In addition, recently I got in an apartment fire for the second time in my life. This caused me to lose all my belongings. They are allegedly being cleaned but it's taking for fucking ever. This means I don't have many of my coping mechanisms, which is only adding to the stress. We had to stay at a hotel for a few nights and now we're in a new apartment but it's not the same. 


But that's not all my shitty life has to offer! In addition I have medical debt. I also tried calling the suicide hotline the other day and the lady on the phone said ""what do you want me to do about it?!"" And later she hung up on me. 

Even aside from all the stuff I mentioned, there's several more recent incidents. I'm just to emotional to type it all up now. I honestly don't know what to do.

forced to live a life i don't wanna,"i (f17) attempted to take my life five days ago, it was my second serious attempt. i took a couple of pills and alchohol and walked out on my ledge. living on the fifteenth floor made it so much more easier. i spent all night out there, on call w a friend who managed to keeo me safe till i passed out. my dad was woken up at 3am by another friend of mine who tried entering my apartment and they pulled my back into my room unconscious. 
my parents haven't spoken to me about it. theyve nailed my window shut and don't let me stay alone in my room. I'm getting a new psychiatrist, I'm not allowed out or allowed to hang w my  friends after school. they also didn't let me skip school this whole week even though im still not fully recovered.
i feel like a prisoner in my own house. i get why they're doing it but they way they've gone about it only makes it worse.
to make matters worse it drove most of my friends away. a discord server that i considered my main support group won't let me back in unless i get better. most of my irl friends decided to give up on me, they told me they're done trying to  help someone who doesn't wanna be helped. i feel like i have nothing good left in my life and I'm forced to live only cause my parents want me to.

last letter ⚔️," I was supposed to stab myself in the heart, in the desert in Joshua Tree, in November 2021. 
I thought I was ready. 
I decided not to because 1) I realized I’d probably have to stab myself more than one time and I knew I couldn’t mentally handle that. I felt depressed enough to stab myself but not psychotic enough to keep going, especially after physical shock. Also, part of me wanted to see if I could fix things and it was like I went on a mission with myself to see if life was worth it. If my life is worth living. 

The answer is no. It’s definitely no. 
I want out. I want off this fucking ride. I wish things were different but they aren’t. 

I even went to the fucking hospital (VOLUNTARILY) for help, since my last post here. Absolute hellhole.  I don’t even have words for you about what happened. Darkest week of my life. People are sick. I’m so much worse I can’t explain what’s happened 

It’s not like Gunnhild from Vikings, but I’m at the marina and someone abandoned their bonfire, left it all for me. I tried to give an older woman passing by the last of my cash cause she was picking up recyclables, she refused and was sweet. She said to not sit here at night, she was concerned that I’m young and “there’s crazy people out here”, no offense, but I’m the crazy person, ma’am. Sweet lady. 

I had asked God for a sign, I got a fucking sign. I told God, or the Universe or whatever, that to commit suicide I needed to be pushed. And I got just that. Tenfold.

I’m proud of myself for pushing as hard as I did, for lasting this long. I don’t need to prove to other people I fought. I know I did, and I can rest better knowing i kept that promise to myself.

I wish I had seen more of the world, and visited more cities, but I’ve had my fill of humanity. I can’t do it anymore. I hate the way people treat each other, how much bullshit is always involved. I’m tired. Worn out. No amount of sleep or rest touches this kind of tired. Hell is hell. 

I hope my next life is gentler.
I hope the tides are kinder. 
I hope I receive love i never have to defend myself from. 
I give myself peace now, because I cannot find it here. My life is obligated to no one &amp; nothing else. Im truly sorry.

This breakup was the worst thing to have happened to me,"I know a lot of people are like “you’ll get over him over time” and shit like that, but he was the best thing to have happened to me. At this point, it’s not even love, it’s way more than that. I put him up on a pedestal and admired him. He made me so happy. I’m not close with any of my friends or family, but with him I was the most comfortable. My world revolved around him because he deserves the world and more. The way he helped me when I was at my worst made me feel so appreciated. I can go on and on, hours and hours, years and years talking about the love I have for him, but no words can fully express it.

But of course, he left me, and it’s all my fault. He told me he didn’t see himself being happy in the long run due to how high-maintenance I was. That broke me. In just a second my whole world is gone and it’s all my fault. I just wish I could reverse time and change the way I acted.

The only thing stopping me from committing suicide is the fact that we can still get back together, but I just feel so hopeless right now. I have had hopeless and suicidal thoughts before, but he always was by my side and helped me through it all. Now without him, I basically have nothing.

All I want right now is him. I’ll give up anything for him- i’ll give up my phone, all my money, my academic achievements, even my body parts for him. He is all I want and all I see and it’s killing me. And I feel so fucking selfish for that. He said he wouldn’t be happy with me in the long run and here I am begging for him back. I’m so mad at myself for making him feel unhappy yet still wanting to be with him. He deserves more than me, but I still want him. I can’t live without him, and I can’t live with myself.

I just want to talk to someone who went through/is going through the same experience as me.

I'm sure my fate is gonna end up in suicide,"I've been suicidal since 6th grade. I've never fit in any crowd. And my mind subconsciously mirror people I'm talking to because of trauma, and now idk who tf I really am. I don't remember 70% of my life. Even the bits and pieces I remember are of abuse and trauma. My mind is a terrible place and I can't escape it. After fighting for 24 years, I'm done. I have no hope or fight left in me. It sucks cause I was so close to have all I ever wanted. A good research career, someone who'd love me as I am, a fresh start in a new country. But my parents fucked everything up. They will never let me live my life peacefully. And tbh, I too don't really wanna fight anymore. 

People always say I'm strong. But it's pathetic that I've spent all my childhood, teenage and adulthood trying and learning to be strong, so I could withstand more abuse. While others had fun, had hobbies, learned new skills, travelled, loved and lived. My strength just got me more scars and more trauma. It's stupid really. 

Anyways, all my life I fought for a way out. Now my dad just like that blocked it and I can't do much about it. I'm so furious at this world and my parents and everyone who bullied and abused me into killing myself. They've won a lot of times. It's just another win for them. And it'll give eternal freedom for me. So I think no one got nothing to lose.

There's only a buildup of crushed expectations as I stuff myself back into the darkness, deeper each time. I won't last much longer. Never in my life has anyone needed or wanted me as much as I, them. And that hurts.

I cling to the smallest of gestures. Am I crazy? To think ""I'm thankful to have met you"" means being appreciated, human to human? I just want a piece of that closeness everyone else seems to have. I just don't want to be alone. For once, not to be other. Is that too much to ask for? Or, do I not deserve it?

I have given up,"Yesterday when I woke up I made my final decision to take my own life. I have thought it over, and even though there may be other options I decided that I am ready to just simply give up, as the ongoing struggle has made me decide it’s not worth the pain.

I haven’t felt anything but numbness for years. I’ve become obese.  My body is in terrible shape. I’ve battled with addiction, but somewhat recently Ive started to get over it.  When I finally thought that was going well and started to be proud, I was met with people who didn’t seem impressed and moreso judged the small victories I felt, i guess because they didn’t realize just how bad my situation was.  Three weeks off of hard drugs was a major milestone for me, but people said it wasn’t good enough and that I was pathetic for thinking it was impressive. I don’t see a bright side as I am finishing college, even though I was given a great job offer, because I would just be continuing a life in a city where everyone hates me while I can work a lot and be miserable.  I am not the type to go out and leave on my own, I would do nothing but recluse myself and probably miss home if I moved away.

I recently came to the realization that outside of the people that are friends with me, my public perception is very much that I am a loser.  My antics have made people that used to consider me a friend not even like me as a person.  A girl I used to love decided to lead me on somewhat recently, just to tell me her friends and everyone else hate me and that she would never consider dating me.  This was essentially my tipping point.

I have decided that Thursday night, when I am returning from a work trip, I am going to park my car on the way home by a bridge. I am going to start drinking heavily.  I will make it look like I lost control as I drive through the rail, and into the water. Those that know me will find this heartbreaking, but ultimately not shocking, and devastating, in the way a suicide might affect them. They will be able to cope with the loss without wondering if it was their fault.

The only flaw in my plan is I have written a note to be left with my closest friend, because one thing I can’t do is leave without letting him know how much I appreciated everything he’s done for me.  I simply cannot do that, but that is one thing that might ruin the hidden intent of my actions.",mewingoyster,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkntfx/i_have_given_up/

I'm a mess, my finances are a mess, my emotions, I can barely take care of my own things. I'm in so much turmoil, I constantly fantasize about offing myself, and every few days I sit there with a gun to my head and I just can't do it, I think of my boy and then the pain is worse.

Why is suicide considered a cowardly act? I believe the opposite is true, as the one who kills himself chooses to die in his own circumstances. Imagine how much power it takes to jump off a building or cut one own veins vertically . 

I recently cutted my wrist horizentaly, just a little bit, I wanted to see blood, to feel pain. I felt so connected with reality , what an amazing experience.

I've spent the past year wanting to be dead more than ever before in my life.,"This isn't the normal kind of post I would write and my followers are probably going to leave because of this, but here I am. Most of the time, I have the thoughts in passing, ""If I were dead I wouldn't have to deal with all of this"" or ""life is just too hard, I wish I wasn't here."" 

Lately things in my life have gotten really bad. I had a miscarriage in January. It sucked because my husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for a long time, and had been told that it wasn't going to be possible without intervention or weight loss or both. But there we were, pregnant, and all of a sudden, not pregnant. 

I spent the last year dealing with some drama at work that took me over the edge more than a few times. I wanted to kill myself so badly, but I never told anyone about it. I'd mention to my therapist that I was having the suicidal thoughts, and he'd check in, but I reassured him that I'd be ok. And he would remind me of all the times I had been here before and gotten out of it. 

Now I'm looking at a tough situation at home. I am not going to go into detail about it, but things are hard at the moment, and I find myself feeling trapped, unwanted, and like more of an annoyance than anything. It SUCKS to feel that way in your own home. I honestly don't know what I'm doing any more, and the suicidal thoughts are getting more real and more pervasive. 

I am finding it hard to stay in a good place. I'm finding it hard to think logically about it. All I feel is desperation and a strong desire to just end it. To be done with the fight of having to live with constant depression and anxiety. Just having rest from that would be a relief, but also....I know I shouldn't do it. 

Life sucks and it shouldn't be this hard.

I have absolutely everything I could ever need. I feel pathetic.,"I hate myself. I've dreamed about finally gathering the courage to end my life for about 7 years. I have everything I need. My basic needs are met, all paid by my caring family. I'm finishing a college degree, also fully paid by my parents. I feel weak and pathetic. I see people with real issues, traumatic shit, who go on with their lives, while I'm sitting here wanting to end my life without a reason. Why do I feel like this. It feels invalid; I've never faced adversity. Every second of my life I've spent tearing myself apart. The only reason I haven't jumped in front of the Metro is that I'm scared to end up quadriplegic; I'm scared of everyone finding out that despite having my life served to me on a platter I still want to die. I feel pathetic, small and alone, and I'm scared I'm starting to lose control of it. Before suicide felt like a refuge or a safe place to escape if necessary, but now it's overwhelming and persistent. I don't want to feel like this anymore, but I can't stop it. Everything I do feels wrong. I've isolated myself from everyone, and by the time I realized how lonely I felt I couldn't find the courage to reach out.

I've gotten involved with clubs of interest, I've done martial arts, I've initiated conversation.. I'm so close to just ending it man. 

I've hit lows many times before, but this time is different because I fucking tried to make things different. I meet someone, we connect and end up hanging out, and then they fade away unless I initiate.

 I've had ""friends"" flake repeatedly after I've invited them numerous times or people that don't invite me out after I had done so in the first place yadda yadda. 


Hell, this all started at the beginning of this year when I realized how people viewed me at my martial arts gym. The coaches thought I was arrogant because I silently carried myself with newfound confidence in life, so I fucking left. 

Point is, I've gotten no reciprocation, even after they've shown genuine interest. I've gotten with a girl a while ago that I still fucking think about. Knew her for less than a month before I made a move..she was interested and we made out multiple times. 

I had ""friends"" and I got with this hot girl, so it seemed things were finally coming together.


I ask her out and she enthusiastically accepts. The day before the date she rescinds and wants to be friends instead. Haven't seen her since. That was 6 damn months ago man. Story of my life. 


I've got no family, no friends. 23 years old. I feel nothing anymore. Been lifting for years and getting stronger and I feel nothing. No interest in shit. Felt confident in myself until recently, since I guess isolation took it's toll.

"im 14 and trying to cope with childhood trauma, while living with one of my abusers and a mother who doesnt even try and understand me","tw: childhood abuse, abandonment, addiction, emotional neglect (i think that what its called?) and, sibling abuse

ive dealt with the favoritism of my sister since i was 5. she was diagnosed with adhd, and therefore needed more attention than i have ever received. she stopped being my dads favorite after she started criticizing his addiction, but that was around 3-4 years later. i grew up taking care of myself, my own needs, i had nobody. it became worse when my dads addiction did, he was nicer to me than my mom, who really used me as her own punching bag by screaming at me for anything, and everything. my dad fully forgot about me. he was my only friend in the family, even though, like my mom, he did care about my sister more. but having somebody less bad, was better than having nobody. 

my sister starting abusing me when i was 10, she was 12. her mental health was really bad, making my mom cater to her even more than shes already done. now my little attention, turned into none. my sister could (and still can) do anything to me, and would get away scot free. she physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, and i was only told to “suck it up” and to just “move on”. this has gone on for the next 4 years of my life, my dad moved out around 2 years ago, not without leaving me with another set of trauma. 

now, im dealing with cptsd. although my sister has gotten somewhat better (she would constantly run away, did drugs, physically hurt everyone in the family and more) but shes insanely rude, due to my mom letting her do whatever she wants, and also extremely aggressive. i started doing a lot worse. im always extremely irritable and angry, and ive been dealing with lots of anxiety and severe depression. i see a therapist, im working hard to get through my trauma, but my mother only believes that i should be fine. that even after dealing with abuse, and being fucking ignored my entire childhood, that i should be a-okay, and act like a normal 14 year old.

she continues to get angry at me for my outbursts (which i understand), but will then tell me that she “doesnt understand why” and will then tell me how awful i am, and how i dont do anything. she doesnt understand that i have lost interest in many things, and refuses to let me take mental health breaks, because for some reason in her fucking mind, i dont need them. all she does is tell me how awful i am, how i dont do enough, how we dont have any money, all of this bullshit. im not allowed to stand up to my sister, because when she attacks me, even after ive done nothing, its all my fault. (she one time attacked me over fucking brownies. BROWNIES??) 

im guilt ridden and tired. living feels pointless to me at this point. i have nothing going for me, and what feels like nobody. i dont why ive stayed this long, maybe its sheer fate, or some stupid reason that i cant put my finger on. i know that soon enough, ill be suicidal again, as surprise surprise! going through this much trauma makes people want to kill themselves. im aware that ill have to spend the next what, 500000 years trying to overcome my trauma, but i just wish that my mother would be there for me, because if she was truly there, i would want to live. i just want her to finally love me.",cooperdupa,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkbq9j/im_14_and_trying_to_cope_with_childhood_trauma/

I thought that i would write down my feelings, but my mind resonated that to writing a suicide not. I'm proud of myself for stopping when i realised that it made me feel worse.

I feel lonely. I have friends who i trust, care for, and can talk to. Yet, it's impossible for me to tell them about any of my true feelings, because even i cant understand what's going on in my head. 

I feel guilty for thinking that one of the main reasons for my behaviour is my family. They have always emotionally neglected me, treated me as the dumb kid, invalidated any feelings i expressed, and my mother is physically and verbally abusive. I barely share things with them, and nowadays they've started scolding me for telling them anything because apparently I'm too pessimistic.

My sister seems to be using me. I have always been there for her and listened to her when she needed. While she is there for me if i need help with studies and shit, she never even makes an attempt to listen to me because apparently that's a therapists duty and she isn't my therapist. 

I can't cry, i can barely feel things, at this point I'm like a zombie.


My mental state usually deteriorates in the summers, and summer is here. I can sense the decline.

My only friend who i can physically meet and am comfortable sharing deeper details about myself to, seems to (understandably) freak out when it comes to suicide related topics if it involves known examples(basically jokes and stuff are fine, but he seems to get a bit perplexed if i mildly hint at my suicidal nature).

"No desire, just... the thoughts","I think I've slept three full hours in the past 48. It's not that I don't try to sleep or want to; I do, and so badly. I'm so exhausted. 

Right now I'm crammed into a toddler bed, cuddling my kid. Even laying here, all I can think about is whether or not she wouldn't be better off with a different mother - and I know I'd never do that to her. I never would or could; she didn't ask to be in this world and I have no right to leave her in it, especially with that kind of burden. So why does the thought keep whispering itself in the forefront of my mind, even when I've slept well? 

Why the fuck do I feel so terrible, as if I've been kicked in the stomach to the point of puking. I feel like a failure in everything - am I really at the point where I'm supposed to celebrate my own mediocrity after accomplishing simple tasks that I'm supposed to do? Should I be applauding myself for getting out of bed, next? 

I left my job to stay home with my kid, just a month before the pandemic was acknowledged. No one could, or did, come to see me. But I realized that even without the pandemic, nobody really would have been there anyway. She was five months old then, and in that time period nobody really was there. They didn't call. Didn't video chat. Didn't really ask how things were or how I was.

I was crushed before the pandemic. Our events were cancelled - I couldn't see my friends. Most of them, I still haven't seen two years later. We don't really talk either. There's only one person outside of my immediate family that I've called in… months, and it stings. A few months ago we moved out of state, and out here we have no friends, no family. I've tried making friends over the internet, especially through pursuing my roleplaying hobby, but it feels like I keep fucking up. Trying to keep my emotions and attachments in check, but inevitably I think my loneliness just bleeds through, or I let myself open up too much and just… fuck it up. 

My emotions, my entire //self// might as well be sodden playdoh. I'm desperate to keep it formed into what it should be, what it/I used to be. But before long I'm trying too hard to keep it in shape, and it's left in a flattened, half-soggy mess of… garbage. Every night I curl up in bed and have my stupid fucking brain remind me of how garbage I am, of all the mistakes I've made and maybe I really would be better off just giving it up. Telling me there's no point to keep bothering others with my - I don't know. Existence, I guess. Mistakes. 

Logically, I know that's part of my problem. It always has been, really. I tried to keep everything together so other people wouldn't know what was happening to me back then; I had to take care of it and handle it on my own. I have to be able to do everything, and when I can't, I feel worthless. Like a waste. What am I even doing that someone else couldn't take the reins on and do better? I've been replaced plenty of times. Even my husband was searching on Grindr and posting on Craigslist, listing ads that included the fact that he was married… sending pictures, texts. Telling me it was my fault after I found out. I'm somehow to blame for it. 

I haven't told anyone that. Typing it out feels slimey, like three day old used dishwater. It's another thing I have to handle myself, because I could never actually admit to someone else that it happened. Just like I couldn't admit to anyone I know about what my ex did to me. What happened when I was a kid. I told one person - a therapist - in honesty what happened and I remember her saying that if I kept being angry about it, then I'd turn out like that person. 

Who says that to an eight year old? 

Anytime I've brought it up since then, it was never to admit how it's part of what still keeps me awake over two decades later. Stupid electric meatball in my skull, trying to convince me it matters. Trying to convince me I'm going to keep going downhill, and should just get ahead on what's inevitable anyway.  People can, and would, move on and maybe it'd be better.

I wish it'd stop with this shit. My daughter said today that she loves me. I have to be doing something right, don't I? 

I don't know what to do to fix this. I'm just screaming into the void right now.

They’re going to hate me. I’m just so scared,My mom straight up asked me last night if I was cutting my wrist in front of my entire family when she saw my scars. I think she said that joking but it’s the truth. I’m so scared she’s going to push it further. I’m so scared she’s going to hate me for it and punish me. I feel so so stupid for doing it on my wrist. So so stupid. I just didn’t think anyone would notice. They haven’t ever before. I’m not sure she actually suspects anything from me. Tonight I think I’ll burn my wrist cooking something so that it covers up the scars and the story is more believable. They’re all going to hate me. I didn’t sleep all night last night because I’m so scared. I used to think I’d be ok with people finding out I feel like this but I’m not.

I am so fucking shattered.,"Last Sunday my husband, we've been together 18 years and have a child together, admitted to me that he was talking to his co-worker. He slept with her Thursday after lying about going to work. He tells me he doesn't want to leave but he doesn't know what he wants anymore. Friday, he admitted he has cheated on me 2 other times in the past and yesterday, on my birthday, I found out 1 of those people was my own sister when I took her in after her husband had been cheating on her. I am so heartbroken for myself and my son and all I can think about is ending it all. I trusted this man implicitly and never even thought he would cheat. There were never any signs at all. All I can think about now is ending it once and for all. I've lost my husband and my sister and I really don't have much left.

"I Miss Her, I Might Be Gone Soon.","This is a long story I'm sorry. Me and my ex broke up 2 years ago but we remained friends. But I still loved her and still do to this day. After 4 months she stopped talking to me because of this. When we were together I never lied to her... well I only lied about 1 thing and it's about why I tried kms when I was 12. To this day no one knows the real reason, maybe my friend bc I almost slipped about it. I treated her like a queen. We lived 10 hours away from each other and I saved up $2k to go see her when we were together. (For gas and my dad stayed at a hotel. I was 17 at the time.) Every anniversary I wrote a very long paragraph maybe 2 on why I love her, and how beautiful she is. At 1st it was every sunday of the week (we started dating on sunday) then the 19th of every month. We lasted 10 months together. Each paragraph was different and never said the same thing. I did this to help make her feel better about herself because she was ashamed of her body and I could tell she was depressed. I wanted her to be happy. I bought her a lot of gifts and always asked how her day went. (Btw I'm very poor and at the time I mowed lawns to make money. 50 a week during spring and summer. I'm allergic to grass, and been doing it since I was 14.) We broke up and she told me because she was gay but we can still be friends. I quit my job 2 months after bc of depression. We had a discord server that contained her brothers and their friends. There was this 1 guy that we always played with and me, her, her brother, and the guy played doki doki. At 1st he was nice then when they left he was very mean to me. Saying things like ""she doesn't like you just leave"", ""why are you even trying"" and so on. I never said anything because I didn't want to ruin any friend ships. I wish I said something instantly. We all played overwatch together also. Well I tried to stop playing with just him and only play with her. I said it was bc of my anxiety but the real reason was bc of him. 4 months later she stopped talking to me because I still loved her. (This is where and why I might be gone soon, warning I'm going to say graphic things. Plz know I don't want attention, I just want my story to be told if I do leave 1 day.) My #1 phobia is being alone, and she helped me forget a terrible memory when I was 12 (the real reason that no one knows about.) I was scarred, (I regret doing all of this) I made 10 accounts on insta saying sorry. And emailed her sorry also. Plz know I regret doing all of this and understand I was in a dark place. Still doesn't justify my actions. Some time after that I was dmed on insta to go kms and other horrible things. I tried telling her but she looked at the screen shot and just blocked me. Then it happened again, then again, I was being told to go kms and other things for 5 months straight. Even was bullied by her bf at the same time. I screen shotted what he said to me also. In the middle of all this my mom ODed and was in a hospital for a week. I had no one to talk to, I tried crying out for help to her. No response. I tried crying out for help about the guy telling me to kms for months, no response. She is the only 1 able to stop him. She never really tried. The only ppl who tried to get them to stop was me and my friend. He was the only help I had. On Christmas and Easter I also emailed her saying I hope her and her family is ok because covid was bad and her family is like family to me I worry and care about them a lot. (Still was being told to kms and messaged by her bf) I started cutting month 2 of being told to kms (I stopped a little while ago) since I was still being told to kms and bullied by her bf and no change was happening I cried for help to her parents. I showed them the screen shots of what her bf said to me and told them about the person (who we still don't know) who told me to kms. Later I got a message from her saying that not only she regrets our relationship but she is scarred of me and I have to apologize to my friend who was helping me through all of this. Btw I don't have the guts to yell at someone bc I'll have a mental break down bc of past trauma (parents always yelled at me) and I dont have the guts to hurt anyone (mentally or physically) unless it's to protect my friends or family. (I'm a very protective person of who I love and like) when I read this I was badly hurt. I started doing drugs (not weed bc the smell makes me want to vomit and ill never try it) but whippets (was accident but made pain go away so I kept doing it) some time later my dad got cancer (he's doesn't anymore it got removed right away) but while he was gone I had a bad mental break down and I did a free therapy trail online. (I forgot the website) but I did this with 3 different emails so I had 3 sessions. I did it for her bc she always told me to get professional help. I got told I might have severe adult separation anxiety. I have nightmares every night about losing her (still to this day) I said a lot more (infact I told them everything) and they told me that. They can't officially diagnose me with it because they wanted to talk to me more but I'm poor. I can't afford that. But I then had no one so I cried for help to her 1 last time (I was scarred). Her dad texted me to never message he again. That night I did a full inhale of whippet and tried to kms. I had seziure (idk how to spell) and woke up the next day. No one checked in on me. I woke up on my floor. That was the last time I ever did that. Some time later her bf messaged me again, it was a pic of him and her kissing making a heart of their hands. He said ""just give up she doesn't love you and never has"" I showed the screen shot to some friends and then deleted it bc it was painful to look at. What am I sopose to do? Cry for help? I can't. To this day he messages me mocking me. But she'll never believe me. Not only I can't tell her but I don't think she even cares. I also later found out the real reason why she broke up with me was bc I was too clingy. Not only did my friend tell me this, her bf did also. Everyone who I told this story to tells me she cheated on me. That there's no way someone would let this happen if they cared about me after I treated her with respect like that during our relationship. I don't think she cheated on me, she would never do that. I tried going out with other girls but I cant bc it feels like I'm cheating on her even tho we're not dating. It feels wrong. I still love her. And I always will. Even tho she never asked if I was ok when I was being told to kms. (Which hurts badly) I still love her. The only reason I'm alive is because of my hope (a 2nd chance with her) but it's dying, and I want to die b4 my hope dies. Or I'm going to die when my hope dies which means I'll have no happiness left. The 1st time I felt happiness was when she said yes to going out. I cried that night bc I never felt that b4 bc of childhood. I just want her to at least ask if I'm ok. Just to prove my thoughts wrong. To prove that she still cares. To keep me going. I love you *** and I always will. If you some how see this, I know you're tired of seeing this, but I'm sorry. Plz know if I do lose the battle, I lasted this long for you. I hope you're proud of me. And if you do message me, I might come out about the real reason why I can't let go. And for whoever read this long, thank you. I hope you have a great life, be safe.

Idk if I typed this but I haven't done drugs in a year.
Won't be on this account a lot (only to vent.) It's a alt account. I'm just trying to get help even tho the only help that will help me is her saying anything nice to me. Idk when but when my limit is reached bc of her bf and friends, and all the past crap they said to me. I plan on going 100mph+ to a pole. I already know where I'm going to do it. It's not like she cares anyways. I get told to go kms for months and bullied to this day and not once ask if I'm ok, I doubt she'll be sad. My thoughts are telling me she'll be happier if I'm dead. I get harassed, I get yelled at for crying for help. I get told to kms, I get yelled at for crying for help.",Vent519,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tknrrf/i_miss_her_i_might_be_gone_soon/

Thanks for reading my crappy writing if you made it this far. 

I wrote this tonight because my brain wouldn't shut up. I've had all these thoughts on and off for a while now. I feel like these thoughts are becoming more and more frequent and intrusive. I reached out to my primary care physician asking about a psychiatrist and I was told to find one myself since it wasn't clear I needed a referral. Then I tried a couple of time to find one online and couldn't find one in my area I was willing to talk to. So I gave up. If I'm at work and interacting, I'm mostly ok. I think I only had really fucked up thoughts once or twice. But if I'm alone at nights my brain goes haywire and this stuff pops in. I need to stay busy to keep it out but I'm too lazy to stay busy enough to keep it out. 

Anyway I'm not a danger to myself right now. I don't have the means to play out the scenarios in my head. And I haven't tried to get them. I don't want anyone I know to read this but I need to share it somewhere so I can only post it here.",oof_and_orz,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkk1t8/if_by_then/

I want to kill myself (Male),"I'm only 15 3 years ago I was really one of the famous kids in school everything was going well until first quarantine started. I became probably the most antisocial person. It was the last half year of school so didn't go anywhere because I was doing online lessons.i didn't go out with friends at all until next year where quarantine stopped for 1 month so had to go to school again. I started getting bullied by my own friends. I couldn't handle it. I was thinking of commiting suicide back then to. I got through it but this made me even more antisocial. I couldn't trust anyone for a really long time because as I said these were my own friends bullying me for fun. Now at the 3rd year everything is kinda ok. I started going out with friends again 1 month ago after so long but I don't like going out with them. 2 weeks ago I was in bed thinking and my hole life what I like the most is video games and lucid dreaming. I thought the reasons why these are the only staff I enjoy to the conclusion that they offer me just an escape from sad reality. Which is me not enjoying literally anything else. School is my biggest enemy, my hole life I wait for it to be over but just can't deal with it anymore only for me to wait every day to end just to basically sleep and play some video games . So I faked being sick with a lot of fever for the past 2 weeks to escape school and all the stress I have in life. My parents took me to the doctor and he said to do a lot of tests so we can see what is my ""illness"" my parents found out because the tests showed that I don't have anything.

The Shittiness of Existence,"Alrighty folks, I've been ready to go for a while but I guess now it feels more right to leave this world. No offence but this has been the most boring, nonsense tenure ever and I have no idea how the majority have deluded themselves into staying in a world that is mostly just a turd with sparkles and corn in it then call it the 'spice of life'. I am increasingly bored with life, nothing is worth the effort or struggle to do what- die later? That is not appetizing. 

I quite uni, I quit therapy, I quit meds. I don't really want to be here anymore but I am constantly held back by my own laziness. I just want to sleep all the time to the point that I hope that any merciful god would give me death as a reward for withstanding such a shitty existence. 

I haven't even mentioned what was wrong with mine. The list is short and simple:

1. I really dislike the premise of working for everything.
2. I dislike working for something and the feeling of accomplishment is a dull tap and I am wondering wtf I just pulled all my teeth out for.
3. Nothing is really ever worth it. I am not remarkable, average or even good. Anything I have is as replaceable as a wasted battery and that is ok. Nobody relies on me and that is the best place to be for someone who wants out.

I know I don't need any reason to justify wanted to make a grand exit, I think its almost abusive to sedate someone into living, gaslight their entire experience for extra hands in the population politics cog. Too many people are wastes of space and have absolutely nothing yet still have convinced themselves that life is better than the great void.

I think it’s gonna happen soon. It keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and if it doesn’t get better soon it’s time. Note is ready and method is being prepared. The few things I have left are being overshadowed too much.,"I don’t know how much longer I’m gonna wait. Could be a few days or a couple weeks or months. Definitely by the end of the year though. It all depends on if it gets even worse and how much worse it gets. If it gets better then I won’t do it. But I don’t see that happening given the pattern.

It’s like every month I lose someone else, every day I get a bigger workload and enjoy the things I like a little less. I’m an alcoholic and I’m not even old enough to drink.

I’ve promised it to myself so many times because it’s comforting feeling like the way out is close even if it’s not happening. But this time is different. This time I really don’t think I can go on.

Maybe I’m just a baby. Maybe I’m over dramatic. Maybe I’m a piece of shit who deserves to die, or deserves to live miserable. It doesn’t matter anymore. The reasons I have aren’t gonna go away or get better just because people tell me they aren’t good reasons. 

Sorry to everyone. I’m glad I made a new account, so they won’t see this specific post at least.

I’m disappearing [23M],"I shouldn’t post here, or anywhere else but I have nothing else, so firstly I want to apologize. I’m sorry that you have to read this, first off because it’s all nonsense and also because it may be stupid or weird since English isn’t my first language.


I have nothing. No family, no friends, no job, I’m stuck in my apartment because I’m a coward (psychiatrist tells me I have agoraphobia but I don’t think it’s true). I’m just a waste of time, space and money. 
There’s no need for me to still be here. I’ve tried multiple times to end it all, when my family were still here I got caught and sent to psychiatric ward, and now it’s a neighbor who knew my dad, he keeps coming again and again to see if I’m ok. I’m wasting his time as well, like I waste your time writing this. 


I don’t even know why I need to do this, it’s not like I want any help, nor I need any help. Maybe I just want to leave something somewhere, testify about loneliness and mental illness. 
I’m already shameful, just thinking about somebody will see this and witness how I’m such a stupid human being just complaining about nothing, playing the victim although I’m not. 

Long time ago I thought I was a victim tho. My dad did things to me, people at schools bullied me. I was thinking like that, my mindset was fxcked up. Now that I’ve rethink about it, all I see is : the problem was and still is me. I can’t blame others over what i did. 

I don’t wish this to my worst enemy. This void that keep devoting me, taking more and more space, making me disappear slowly. 
Again, I’m sorry about all that. And thanks to this sub if that post is not removed.

If you’re in this state, I hope you’ll get better soon. I don’t know you, but you’re worth it. Don’t let anybody tell you otherwise and never give up on things you like or that makes you feel good.",Nvcci,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkfdx8/im_disappearing_23m/
"A few years ago, I found out that someone was posting my nude photos online without my consent and it still makes me feel suicidal","In 2018, I found out a former ""friend"" and person I used to have sex with in 2016 was posting my naked photos to a nude sharing reddit page/kik and trading them with strangers on the internet. We lived in two different countries when I discovered this and the only thing I could do was call/email with the police in his area and inform his girlfriend at the time. The police didn't really do much, but they were able to track him down and tell him (by phone or in person, not really sure) that he should delete the images he has of me. That was all that came of it, the police couldn't really even ensure he had deleted them. His girlfriend broke up with him. I did speak to him and he sounded sorry to have been caught, he didn't seem to feel bad at all for how he made me feel. Ever since I have been struggling with this. I feel extremely violated and stupid, especially since he could still have the photos and be trading them with other people.

I was only 20 and he was 35 when we were sharing nudes and having sex, and I feel like I did something that could potentially follow me forever. I was struggling hard with mental illness at the time. I also had very little sleep and a stressful schedule, I feel like I went into some depressive spiral and I started doing dangerous and promiscuous things, including being with him. I know it's not an excuse however.

Most days I just try not to think about what happened, but some days, it comes so strong and I get an intense urge to kill myself. I am currently married to the love of my life and he was an amazing support when I discovered my images online in 2018. I know doing something bad to myself would absolutely crush him, but I feel so worthless sometimes. I still feel so violated. I have the guy blocked on facebook, but I know who his current partner is and I occasionally type in the usernames he used to share images to make sure there havent been any posts since then. He still seems to have a kik username active under the same name, but I have no idea if he is still using it. The police told me it would be hard to prosecute for something like this, so telling me that I should try to get legal help is useless. I obviously can't tell most people about this, only my husband knows, so thank you for listening. It's been years now since this all happened and I still occasionally feel extremely suicidal over it, I don't know what to do to stop this. I struggle with depression and anxiety on top of this, but I usually don't feel suicidal unless this comes up.

Past the tipping point and I don't know if I can keep going,"We found out a couple of days ago that my dog needed to be put down. We had a beautiful last day with her yesterday. Technically she was the family dog, but she spent the most time with me and turned into an unofficial support dog for me. She has been with me through trauma and therapy and everything in-between. She has been my rock. 

Scarlett has been an anchor point, a grounding into the world. She has been the only thing that has stayed steady in a world of ups and downs. She was there no matter the mood, or how sick I was. She has kept me engaged with the outside world, walks and beginning interactions. She greeted the world with a smile no matter what. She forced you to give her affection and in turn forced hers on you.  She has been the definition of unconditional love in my life, mainly because I can't assume or misunderstand what she does or says.  She has been my safe place, both physically and mentally. I didn't want to leave her behind not understanding.
 
I've been struggling with everything even with her to  bring me calm. I don't know how to do this without her. I've been using numbness to try and stop myself from shattering, but as it splinters into smaller and smaller pieces there's only so long it can hold. As I hear the splintering standing on the cliffs edge, the ground starts to shake. I know that if I move I will explode into tiny fragments and that I can't escape from the edge of the cliff falling. 
The splinters are so small I won't be able to be put back together without missing pieces. The fall into the abyss will spread the fragments far and wide. There isn't a way to climb back out this time. There isn't the energy to hope enough to look. 

I don't want to die specifically. I just can't keep doing this anymore. I'm beyond tired, I'm spent. I can't see any other options.  I've tried and tried and tried different treatments. I've pushed to do exercise and socialise and do what other people have decided is the best for me. I've taken medication, even with shitty side effects. Taking some rest time with no appointments or 'pressure' was lovely but didn't change anything inside.  
I've been fighting as hard as I can. And it hasn't been enough. 
I began having passive suicidality when I was 8. And having 2 intense traumas later certainly didn't help.  The past year has been the hardest and lowest I've ever reached. I've been in and out of hospital, tried over 40 different meds, tried different therapies than I have in the past, had ECT and tried EMDR. I have a whole team. Mental health social worker, psych, intervention teams, a doctor, specialist and so on. 

 The only advice that I was given when I explained that I was too tired was to push through. To keep going because there have been improvements, and people think it will change, and to be patient for things to start working, and maybe I should try doing more things or less things or have extra support or change my dosages or simplify my medication or go to hospital or an outpatient program. 
I  can't do anymore. I can't keep forcing myself onwards because other people will notice a change in the outside without much of a change inside. 

I know it's a selfish decision. And that it doesn't get rid of the pain, just passes over to the people around me. It will affect them forever, it won't disappear with time. I can't kid myself that they will get over it. As much as I think it will be the better option, I know none of them will agree. I can't look through rose coloured glasses saying it takes away the burden. It just changes it from me to the people around me. 
I'd love to say my goodbyes with everyone and give them time to grieve and prepare with them. Have a perfect last day, making sure that everyone knows I love them and that it is no one's fault. Doing things with people that are special for us. Trying to say everything that I want to to people face to face. To give big hugs and laugh together one last time. I wish I could give everyone that. I'm so sorry that I can't and for the suffering that brings. 

There is too much to say to all the people who are precious in my life to write down. I'm sorry.  I love you. You did nothing wrong.  You are so important to me. I'm sorry that I stopped trying. Thank you for our relationship. You have added so much joy to my life. I believe in you and all you can achieve. I'm sorry that there is no time to come to terms with the idea. 
I know there isn't any combination of words or thoughts that will make it any easier for anyone. I know there isn't anything  that I can do to assuage the guilt and pain and anger. I wish I could, but that doesn't really matter does it. 

I don't even know if I can commit to finishing a plan. Everyone seems to think so, but I don't know. And if I can't go through with it then no-one needs to worry or be concerned because there isn't actually danger. And I can just be unhappy without the need for restriction and people feeling responsibility for me.",miserableelephants,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkm13a/past_the_tipping_point_and_i_dont_know_if_i_can/
"I desperately want to not be alive but don't have a ""real"" reason, which makes me feel worse?","I'm terrible at articulating my thoughts so apologies in advance. Let me just say up front that no plan has been made and despite thinking about it so much I don't think I could go through with it. This is just a vent piece I guess.

I feel like such a burden all the time. I genuinely only have one real friend left, and feel like my roommates/co workers hate me.

I'm anti-social and awkward. I don't make eye contact and I don't talk at all ever. I take way too long to text back. If I did kms I honestly don't think anyone would know until a body was found or over a month had passed.

I'm just so sick of feeling like an obstacle all the time, like I'm always in the way, or always wrong to think/feel a certain way.

But all of this seems pretty normal? I realise it's not a healthy mindset but literally everyone on earth has trauma. Everyone has their own shit they're going through. And not only does it seem like they're handling it a lot better than me, but they have real problems.

I have friends who lost their jobs over the pandemic. I have friends going through break ups, grief or whatever and they still manage to practice their hobbies and interact with their fellow man.

But then there's me, doing literally fucking nothing all day every day after work and having the balls to feel like shit over it as if it's out of my control.

I feel weak willed, lazy. And most of all I feel like the world's biggist egomaniac for writing so much about myself as if it needed to be said.

At my wits end,"Hi Reddit, I’m not sure who else to turn to, as I recently had to stop seeing my therapist because I moved states and she is only licensed in my previous state of residence. I am looking for a new therapist, but I simply can’t keep this inside me anymore and I need a place to get it out.

This year (and the last few months of 2021) has been the absolute worst of my entire life. I cannot believe the amount of negativity, loss, tragedy, and pure bad luck that I’ve been experiencing since fall of 2021. It’s been blow after blow and I can feel myself giving up. I’m giving up hope, I’m giving up my optimistic attitude, I’m giving up my will to continue existing. 

In August of 2021, my boyfriend of two years and I began our descent into what eventually led to our breakup in mid December. We shared an apartment in Oregon and I had to move out in January and move across the country, back to my hometown in Illinois. I was devastated about the breakup and under immense stress trying to find a moving company to haul my belongings such a long distance. I finally found one and it turned out to be a scam. They stole all my belongings and I’m in the middle of several complaints with them, but still have yet to see my things and I don’t think I ever will. I lost my boyfriend and my life’s worth of items at the same time.

Living back at home has been difficult, as my sister lives here and we do not have the best relationship. She is severely mentally ill with addiction, depression, and borderline personality disorder, so it’s been very hard trying to manage her moods, outbursts, destruction, etc. She has attacked me many times, said countless hurtful things, and done endless physical damage to the house. Living with her is very stressful.

On top of all this, my grandpa just died tonight. I got a call from my brother out of the blue. I can’t process this right now, and I’m at my wits end. 

In the past 3 months I’ve lost my boyfriend, whom I still love, my old apartment and old life in Oregon, all of my life’s worth of belongings, and now my grandpa. It’s almost funny how insanely negative this year has been. I simply cannot see myself recovering from all this loss and sadness, and I don’t know what to do.

In 22 days I will either continue to live or die,"It all depends on how this goes. Im 20yo male who just got engaged around 2 months ago. We were planning on getting married and having kids together soon. Both started work at the same company making quite good money.

But recently she tells me her feeling for me have changed. That she loves me but isnt sure we should stay together. She feels attracted to a female coworker of hers that is heterosexual so will never return that attraction. We‘ve decided to spend 19 days in an airbnb together to see if we can save the relationship but she told me today its not looking good. Also she revealed that coworker thing only today. I‘ve been staying at my parents house for around 2 weeks now but on sunday will go to the airbnb. 

I know you guys will tell me that she‘s not worth it but I can‘t change how I feel about her. I wish some of y‘all that have gone through similar situations could maybe give me some advice how I could still save this.

If it doesn‘t work out, I will either hang myself or obtain Heroin to overdose on. I have already written a suicide note and mentally been preparing myself. I would do it on the last day while she‘s gone and ask her to come shortly before ending it or maybe even setting up a programme to send the message when I‘m already dead. This is so that she would find me and inform my relatives early enough. Call me an asshole but I think that the people that know me including her would learn from my death to treat people with more respect in the future.

If all goes well I will continue living, if not so be it.

I'm so confused.,"Last night, my girlfriend (20F) of two and a half years told me (20M) that my depression symptoms have been taking a toll on her. She told me that she sees my progress and my growth, but (this is in summary, as she talks around her meaning) it's not enough. It's exhausting her and making her feel poorly. My exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love. So I had to apologize to her last night, and I'm trying to show that I'm growing. But I feel so fucking hopeless right now. And it's only been getting worse. I joined this community because I'm sure I won't actually do it, but I need something to remind me and something to feel less alone because holy fuck am I alone. I feel devoid of love and worth, and I'm struggling to find ways to place it on myself. I can't validate it if it's for me. And I can only form a half-life of happiness if I use someone else as the foundation, so that's superficial. I'm really trying to keep going. But it's so hard. It's exhausting. I just want to sleep all the time. 

There's so much more in regards to our relationship. I've been trying to support her and make amends for who I was when we first met. I brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in ways of gaslighting, infidelity and emotional neglect. She didn't have any trigger for me to lash out at her. I just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction, but I'm told that's love now. I'm confused. There are two sides of my mind, one an optimist and a lover, the other a cynic and a narcissist. I want to purge my brain of these things.

Queer,"when you can't work and feel like a shadow of a character you put on for other people. When you feel like such a burden to people you love. Almost like you are taking advantage of them because you need their help. I got help but I still feel the effects of this depression. Medication doesn't seem to help the overall feeling that I feel is a lie. I want to ""kill my self"" at least the Identity that I am a strong man. I'm young. 24. I've accomplished more than my father did at my age. However I am still under his roof. 

Failure to launch and failure to exercise work life balance. Living with what I see to be bipolar disorder and the effects it has on my and other peoples lives. Holding on to the Idea I have that to commit suicide would be murder in the eyes of God because I am a slave of his. I gave up my life because Jesus Gave up his. Struggling to understand or at least accept my sinful nature and reject it at the same time. Struggling with the Idea that perhaps I'm Trans, perhaps I'm Gay, perhaps I'm yes. That's ok. 

Looking at myself gain weight because of my own lack of self control with eating. Going from the most disciplined with cutting weight for a pro fight. going from 180lbs to 132lbs in less than 6 months. getting fairly close to the former in 3. 

I feel sick. I feel worthless. Impotent. the exact opposite of what I felt 4 months ago. 

I wanna be well. for other peoples sake. I wanna be taken advantage of in the future. A work horse for someone. A Husband. A friend. An artist--just not a crazy one-- but what can I do, I didn't choose to be mad. I just am.

I want to overdose. so far I do so with caffeine and nicotine. Had I been able to get myself to drink alcohol-- I'd use that. However I hate hangovers. I think once I wake up in limbo I'll still feel it. Doing everything I can to lock myself in the house and not jump off a bridge head first onto the highway. Running out of videos to watch on youtube. running out of Ideas for making music.

feeling alone. feeling a buzz from my meds as I type this. Feeling God looking at me over my shoulder. The devil over the other. I want to be ripped in two. The life I want is living a duel life one for Jesus the other with satan.

"Tried calling the suicide hotline, they hung up on me","My other alt account was deleted, so I'm posting here. Today, I had a mental breakdown on the basis of what I feel are good things in my life disappearing inexplicably, oftentimes whenever I attempt interaction with aforementioned ""good thing."" The last straw was today over a fairly trivial issue, but I broke down because of so many things that had happened recently in my past that I was unable to shrug off. My life is fairly good, and I am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunities; however, it feels as though whenever I try to fully indulge in what's provided to me, whether it be by my hand or anothers, it's normally gone in no time flat. 

About the call: I was in the middle of my breakdown, and tried to take the rational course of action (calling the hotline because I desperately needed to talk with somebody), only to vent my frustrations and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line. I tried calling twice more ok case I hung up on then by accident, but was almost immediately disconnected... And the last time, wasn't able to be connected with anyone. Fuck, what if I were actually about to commit suicide, and just wanted someone to talk with- only to find out that they didn't care about my problems, either? It angers me just typing this.

I'm sick of living this way... I don't think suicide is the answer, but I really just need someone to talk with about my frustrations.

I just want the pain to stop,"I (30f) already struggle with suicidal ideation. I’m just tired, so tired. This last six months has been the toughest six months of my life. I’ve been with this guy(30m) For five years. He has been a step up dad for my daughter(10f) nearly from the beginning of our relationship. Very early had always plan to get married and have children together. My feelings for him have always been so strong. He always made me feel like he was different. Like he understood my trauma and wanted to hold my hand through my healing. Not set mine and my daughters life on fire. I moved to the other side of our country to be with him. We have had ups and downs. I found out six months ago he has a new girlfriend and she also as a you g child (3f). Long story short he’s leaving me for her. Our lease is up at the end of April and my daughter and I have nowhere to go. We will be homeless for a while until I can move back to my parents. My ex-husband (32m) found out we won’t have a stable place to live for a little while and is filing for custody of my daughter. My ex-husband is it has been extremely abusive to me since I was 18. None of the abuse was ever documented because I never wanted to call the police. He always made me feel like I deserved it. I ended up losing my well paying job due to my emotional state. My daughter and i don’t have family or friends here (none that aren’t deeply tied to my now ex bf). I don’t feel like I have deserved any of this shit. Im the go to person that always helps Everyone. Now I’m going to have nothing and I have no one willing to show up for me and my kid. We also have two dogs I will have to rehome because he refuses to take them and I can’t hardly care for myself and my daughter right now. I’m literally about to lose everything. I’ve been chewed up and spit out my whole life. I suffered a lot of emotional and sexual abuse as a child too.

Years go by fast but the days are endless.,"I have never thought I’d reach my 20s cuz since my early years, I have been suicidal. My life has always been the worst. I was given the worst family. My parents were 14 when I was born. They were totally unable to raise a kid yet they decided to keep their pregnancy. Being a teen parent in a country where abortion is 100% legal since 1974 is at least a huge stupidity. I don’t even have to say that my childhood and teenage years were creepy. I went (still do) through needs, I had the worst and cheapest toys, basic clothes, the cheapest cell phones, etc. People are like forget about the past and focus on the present. HOW ?! Do y’all think it’s easy to forget about poverty ? No it’s not. I can’t forget all the humiliations, abuses and privations I had to go through. I’m 31 now, totally hopeless, still suicidal and I’m pretty sure death is the only thing that can take my pain away. And sooner or later I’ll end up as a suicidal person.

Can a sad third world person have a happy first world like life?,"I'm 23 years old and I wish I was born into a traditional family, like the American families we see in movies, a close-knit and loving family, not necessarily rich but with enough money to have a comfortable life, travel with family on vacation, Christmas Eve dinner, etc.
 But I was born in a third world country, where there is not much possibility of being ""rich"", and people are not as educated and refined as in first world countries, nor is there a high human development index.  My family is disunited, there is no affection between us, and we barely have enough money to survive.  But the biggest dream of my life is to one day have a family like the one I mentioned before, united, loving, ""rich"" and happy.
 I really want to have at least one daughter and a wife, and on vacation we travel together to fascinating places, go on a safari in South Africa, see lions, elephants, giraffes up close, climb the Andes mountain ranges, embark on a transatlantic cruise , in short, many adventures and family memories, also for this purpose I'm already studying several languages ​​through apps.
 But given my current situation, all this seems to me to be nothing more than an impossible dream, it's as if I look in the mirror and see that my true image is completely different from how I would like it to be, it's like a beggar in rags looking at a rich man in a suit and envying his life.
 I'm studying Software Engineering at college, and it gives me a little hope that maybe I'll get a good job, move to a better place, maybe a first world country, take my family with me and there I can make my dreams come true, but speaking like that it seems like I'm dreaming too high, it seems that this life I dream of having is not for me and I should just to accept my third world life.

i am so fed up.,"i'm a M17 recently diagnosed with autism and adhd. i have a long struggled with mental health, i have attempted suicide a numerous amounts of time, been addicted to drugs several times and i have given up completely. my mum has cancer and is going into surgery next week to have half of her lung removed, my youngest brother has non verbal autism and i think about what he might be like if he wasn't autistic and all the things i would've done with him. one of my brothers died six hours after he was born from heart failure and the only memory i have of him is having my photo taken beside his corpse dressed in pjamas before he was buried. as a result i constantly breakdown whenever i remember or see anything from my childhood. i was bullied by my only friend group when i was 12 because i was anxious about talking to my crush at the time and it got to the point where they made me extremely suicidal. i was then in an abusive relationship during the pandemic where i was constantly gaslighted, verbally abused, emotionally abused, insulted, threatened with suicide and self harm. as a result my severe anxiety and depression has been increased to a point where i can't even go into school from how overwhelming it is (i haven't been in since early february) and i'm on 3 different medications for my mental health, adhd and sleeping problems. my life is so fucking miserable and i hate myself, my inability to do anything and how i look. i just want to completely tear my body apart from how disgusted i am being in my own body and i just want to kill myself more than anything as i know nothing will improve in my life and i will always forever be like this, just getting worse and going down a further spiral.",sxulxhxe,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tkdwmv/i_am_so_fed_up/

I don't feel like I exist,"Hi, friends, I hope you all are well. Well, I should explain myself, I guess. I don't feel like I exist. I mean that I don't have many people in life, and those who are I don't see them missing me. Friends are nonexistent. I do have a few acquaintances, I guess. I've tried to make new friends and reconnect with old, but school, work, and the guard don't allow for much down time. And it's like I'm the only one trying, so why bother? The logic also goes into my luck on dating. Though, to be honest, I haven't really been trying. I think I would rather make friends first. Work, school, and the guard are just things I do now. I don't really do them because I want to, but because they're things I have to do. And I don't remember why? I just do them like I'm on autopilot. My family is currently ripping itself apart. I've known my parents haven't been happy for a while. But I didn't realize how deeply they hated each other. And in their crossfires is everyone else. I'll keep it short, but somehow a hundred miles away, they still managed to hurt me a way I didn't expect. And I've decided to cut ties with my parents (for the mean time, at least). My brothers are quite literally the only thing keeping me tethered to the world. I don't want to hurt them. But, I just don't feel any joy in any actions I take or any agency. I just feel numb to everything. Not angry. Not upset. Not frustrated. Just hallow. I don't feel like the same person that played Lego Batman with his brothers, split a milkshake on his boyfriend, played Minecraft with his parents, partied with his friends, took pride in what I did, could claim myself. I'm just not. I look in the mirror and I don't feel like a person is looking back at me. Just this husk. And I don't know how to undo that. I don't know how I got here. I don't know how to feel like a person again and not this ghost. Haunting the parks I walked and the clothes I wore. Well, thanks for listening to my rambling. I wish the best for you.

How to move on after a suicide attempt?,"I (27M) had a suicide attempt around 2 months ago and am struggling to move on after it. I tried to overdose on my antidepressants. I was in the hospital for 5 days on the psych floor until I got released.

Since then I moved across the country and am living back at my parent's house in my childhood bedroom. I applied for medical disability from my HS teaching job, am currently in therapy twice a week, and thinking of outpatient programs. My antidepressants were increased along with adding a mood stabilizer. All my life I've never taken medicine and now I am on 4 pills each day.

I am back at home and have no friends here. I use no other social media other than Reddit due to my social anxiety. I just adopted a cat for company but he hides from me all day.

I just feel so stuck and alone. I've been depressed for so long and am not sure how to move on. I feel like I have regressed so much. Everything that I feared for my life when I was young has come true. I am 27 with no partner (gay), no job, and no close friends. My self esteem is shot and last night I cried for an hour when my dad sat beside my bed. Some days I feel ok, but most days at some point I feel hopeless again. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself each day. All my interests are gone and it is hard to just get out of bed.

I feel so alone. I wish I didn't feel like this anymore.,"I don't know who I am anymore. I've tried so hard to regain a sense of who I once was, but it's pointless. Everytime I look at someone, anybody, I instantly feel reminded that I'm nothing. That I will always will be nothing. I'm not clueless. I know why I feel this way. I've been strong for way too long. I've spent my entire life longing for something that will never come: a decent family that isn't problematic, friends, and a proper support system. This entire time, I was never strong because I wanted to be. I had no choice but to be. I'm not a strong person. Keeping false hope by holding onto delusions to get by isn't what it means to be strong. I know the life I'm living now won't last forever, but the damage caused by everything I've gone through is beyond repair. I'm unfixable. 

My whole life has been nothing but a buildup of trauma. And it'll continue to be. It'll never end. More than anything, I wish someone cared about me. Would hold my hand and tell me everything's going to be alright. Hug me when I cry into my pillow at night. Hold me when I'm breaking down because I'm not strong enough to take on the pain alone. But no, I'll never have anyone like that in my life. Only in my delusional mind. If any word defines my life, it's alone. I've taken this journey of endless trauma alone. None has ever truly cared. Everyone just watches me stagger along. 

I wonder why I even wasted any of my time going to therapy. None of my therapists have ever cared. Nothing ever changed. I never felt any better. I'm currently feeling the worst I've ever felt in my entire life. I've experienced so much pain throughout my whole life, but nothing like this. This pain destroyed all my dreams. Destroyed who I once was as a person. There's only one way from here now, and it's more down then I already am. Taking medication for my problems isn't what I need. Throwing pills at my problems isn't going to make me forget about everything that's ever happened in my life. The only two things that would be able to do that for me is severe brain trauma or death. I'm not going to use drugs as means of coping with my life. Using drugs to ""solve and help"" with my problems. I may be a worthless individual, but I'm wise enough to know having to take pills as a means of ""getting better"" isn't the life I want. 

I just need a human being in my life that cares about me. That is able to see my worth; tell me I'm more than all of this trauma. However, I know the reality and I won't sugarcoat it. I come with too many challenges for anyone to have any sort of care for me. I suffer from skin-picking, severe depression and anxiety, PTSD, constant disassociation where I forget who I actually am and feel like the world isn't real. I'm far too fucked up. It explains why I have no friends. Why I have none in my life who truly cares about me. Because of how long all of my problems have gone untreated, I can't escape my suicidal thoughts. My problems will always define who I am. Will always have the last say in everything I do. 

Nothing gives me happiness anymore. Not food, not drawing, not reading or writing, not watching the sunrise, not the moon, not late nights, not going outside, not sleeping; nothing. All of it feels pointless now and it doesn't provide me happiness like it used to me. I've always preferred to keep my emotions to myself and not go to my parents for help because everytime I do I get the same response. They always invalidate my feelings. It's endless responses that always tear me down. They tell me I'm overreacting, that I should leave my problems in the past, that I should stop being a crybaby, that I should ""grow up"" already and stop being problematic, saying that others have life worse and I shouldn't complain about it. There's no point in wasting my time asking them for help. 

I have none else I can reach out to. None else that cares.  I was hospitalized a month ago after I told my school counselor about my suicidal thoughts. What happened? My parents were called, I was forced to go to the hospital, and I got cussed out badly. They said a variety of hurtful things, but what stuck with me the most was being told that if I were actually suicidal, I'd have done it already. Telling me I'm nothing but an attention-seeker. Telling me I wasted my time asking for help and going to the hospital because no gives a shit about me anyways. No care at all for the fact that I'm in the hospital because I don't want to live anymore. I didn't choose to be open about being suicidal because I'm an attention-seeker. I did it because I needed help surviving. If my own parents don't care about me, how can I expect anyone else to have any care for me? The only living being I have left now is my lovely boy Sled. He may only be a dog, but he's all I have left in this world. Unfortunately, I just don't know if that's enough at this point to keep me going. 

Life has given up on me, so I want to give up on myself. I'm tired of my life consisting of surviving, plainly existing without no meaning. I don't want be strong anymore. I don't want to live in my head anymore. I never want to experience trauma ever again. I want to escape. I want to be free. I'm not sure if I'll ever get that chance in life, and even if I do, it won't be anytime soon. If I had to guess, possibly in a few years, but I can't hold on that long. Hell, I don't even know if I can make it to the end of 2022. People with proper support systems really don't realize how lucky they truly are. That's the only that could save me from myself and the only thing I look forward to in the future, if I make it: the chance I'll have my own support system. 

One of the worst mistakes I kept repeating was thinking that professional help would magically make everything better somehow. It didn't. I'm never taken seriously because to them I'm just another ""mentally ill"" person that doesn't hold much worth. Fuck that. I do have many mental illnesses, but I'm aware and I sure as hell know what my reality is and what's going on. I've recently come to realize you can't rely on anyone but yourself to help you get better. Obviously, this is far from easy when you're suicidal. The harsh reality is I can give up or continue living my life in misery. 

This isn't just the harsh reality for me, but so many other individuals who are suicidal, or have suicidal thoughts or ideation. It's not fair at all and none should ever have to come to that realization. I feel like I'm a lost cause now. I'm beyond sick and tired of hearing there's hope for the future, something brighter to look forward to. For the past few years I've been feeling suicidal, all I've been doing is taking life one step at a time, taking it day-by-day, waiting for that one where things finally start to turn around for me. But it hasn't. 

All the time I wonder: maybe there's nothing left in my future except loneliness, emptiness, more nightmares to dream about, more tears to shed, and more trauma to endure. I don't want to live like this anymore. Although I don't wish to die, only escape this life; I'd rather be dead. I don't want to be this aware. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't want the feeling of worrying about what the future holds to consume me anymore. Being failed by the system, failed by society, and failed by life is why I'm suicidal.",MoonlightNostalgia,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tk3k71/i_feel_so_alone_i_wish_i_didnt_feel_like_this/
