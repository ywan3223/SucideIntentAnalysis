koopatroopasupremacy,Friendships and Relationships Make me Suicidal,"Friendships/relationships are one of the biggest jokes in the entire world. I've had friends of multiple years all of a sudden leave me cause ''they didn't see me the same way anymore'' or ''they wanna move on'' or they went through a change or something. I will always be replaced by someone better. 90% of relationships are based on hot looks, lust, manipulating someone for personal desires, money, fame, etc. No one has ever loved me for myself and only lustful desires. I'm done trusting everyone, people are so evil and I am way too paranoid of being blackmailed or betrayed/backstabbed for a petty reason. I lost my soulmate of almost 7 years... what a joke friendships are. It's all about saying bs lines to manipulate that persons emotions and then replacing them when someone better comes along.

Simply_electrifying7,I have a terrible condition and i just cant live with it,"M23. Somewhere in the neck something blocks my veins and i feel horrible pressure in my head because of it. I dont have any other side effects other than unbearable pain and being very uncomfortable almost all the time. Ive had it for almost a year, ive went to doctors, checked myself, done some MRI, did excercises, nothing ever worked out. I dont see any sense in this life even living healthy, now u can imagine how terrible it is to go through when life is just physically painful. Ive gotta tell that this pain changed me a lot this years, ive started to appreciate little things life, to be more empathetic, become much more down to earth, while i was never narcissistic in any way but whatever. Ive got a tons of amazing music that kept me going, i was literally listening music all my life, maybe its the only thing that got me through this life that far because i dont know where else i would find any motivation or desire to continue this miserable life. Ive spent last 7 years mostly sitting at home watching YouTube, movies and playing poker, ive not been to any parties, ive never done anything crazy or active. Last summer i spent in countryside house and ive realised that this is exactly what i want for the rest of my life. I want nature, i want to hear birds when i wake up, i want to ride a bike on max speed while blasting some Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson or breakbeat on speakers, to ride into the sunsets, to spend the nights in a forests, to be in the nature and feel it. I started to truly hate the city life, internet, social medias, all this fucking mainstream lifestyle, career, job. Jobs always screwed me over no matter how loyal i was, and that was my biggest mistake ever fucking working for someone. I dont want to work like a slave any fucking day in my life no more but this life is all about money to survive, so idk how the fuck i would support the life i visualised for myself without money.. And like even if i was healthy, even if i had the money, even if i spent my whole life in the nature as i planned, whats the fucking point anyways? I really feel like spiritually or idk logically i realised everything about this life that i need to know. Like i already feel like i know enough so that i can just die and move to some other dimension in the afterlife if it exists. Like i feel like i dont need to go through this life anymore like i wont gain anything, and whats the point in materialism if u lose everything when u die. I feel like my suicide would be completely justified because this fucking pressure in my head is really very very annoying and i somehow managed to live a decent year with it but i just dont see why i should live with this ""disability"" when everybody around is just healthy, why should i life the same life but with this fucking bullshit?",simply electrifying 7 m23 somewhere neck something block vein feel horrible pressure head dont side effect unbearable pain uncomfortable almost time ive almost year ive went doctor checked done mri excercises nothing ever worked dont see sense life even living healthy u imagine terrible go life physically painful ive gotta tell pain changed lot year ive started appreciate little thing life empathetic become much earth wa never narcissistic way whatever ive got ton amazing music kept going wa literally listening music life maybe thing got life far dont know else would find motivation desire continue miserable life ive spent last 7 year mostly sitting home watching youtube movie playing poker ive party ive never done anything crazy active last summer spent countryside house ive realised exactly want rest life want nature want hear bird wake want ride bike max speed blasting rob zombie marilyn manson breakbeat speaker ride sunset spend night forest nature feel started truly hate city life internet social medias fucking mainstream lifestyle career job job always screwed matter loyal wa wa biggest mistake ever fucking working someone dont want work like slave fucking day life life money survive idk fuck would support life visualised without money like even wa healthy even money even spent whole life nature planned whats fucking point anyways really feel like spiritually idk logically realised everything life need know like already feel like know enough die move dimension afterlife exists like feel like dont need go life anymore like wont gain anything whats point materialism u lose everything u die feel like suicide would completely justified fucking pressure head really annoying somehow managed live decent year dont see live disability everybody around healthy life life fucking bullshit terrible condition cant live

mxsugarbat,Been depressed for a while. Chronically suicidal all week. What should I do to get immediate help?,"I’ve posted here before in my previous attempts, and luckily, I made it out safe, know that I do want to at least try to live beyond 30. That still doesn’t stop my mind from going there often.

This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. 

Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. 

My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.  And there’s the fact that a grandchild from my brother is coming, and I can’t help but think this is the sign. This is the chance for me to talk my leave. But I understand that just offing myself is going to hurt my family and one friend so much.

So here’s where I’m at: i have a half-thought out plan. I REALLY DON’T want to die, but the mental pain is so unbearable i don’t know how to control. Telling my family and friend about this is only going to make me feel guilty/worse. I work as a para at a high school in Texas and have maybe one sick day left. I’m waiting till my contract is out and then I’ll formally quit and look for other opportunities. 

I’m considering going to a mental hospital to check myself in so I don’t actually go through it. Would I be fired if they found out/have to tell them if I stay there for longer than expected? How does it usually go when checking yourself in for suicidal thoughts from anyone’s experience (from TX would really help)? Researching has only given me vague answers and I don’t know if I’ll just lose my job/paycheck because I’m scared. How do I even tell my mom that I’m driving myself to a clinic because I’m scared I might run off and die without giving her a panic attack? 

I’m waiting till a few hours from now to decide my next action. Maybe these thoughts will go away by them, but future reference may help me later if it ever comes up again.

I do want to live, but I’m scared of myself.",mx sugar bat posted previous attempt luckily made safe know want least try live beyond 30 still stop mind going often week ha challenge recently got diagnosis adhd helping finally energy day motivation improve life least recently mind one block make everything unbearable thought job even passionate anymore wasting everyone time one close friend love heart know handle constant heavy stuff deal lost friend due opening vowed talk stuff therapist one else basically mom also mentally ill seeing go putting lot guilt fact grandchild brother coming help think sign chance talk leave understand offing going hurt family one friend much half thought plan really want die mental pain unbearable know control telling family friend going make feel guilty worse work para high school texas maybe one sick day left waiting till contract formally quit look opportunity considering going mental hospital check actually go would fired found tell stay longer expected doe usually go checking suicidal thought anyone experience tx would really help researching ha given vague answer know lose job paycheck scared even tell mom driving clinic scared might run die without giving panic attack waiting till hour decide next action maybe thought go away future reference may help later ever come want live scared depressed chronically suicidal week get immediate help

Admirable_Sea4799,"I'm so tired, it hurts every day I'm still alive","I feel so tired of living like this, alone with no friends, no  one to love, with a family that you care so little to nothing. I dont have any taste for anything, no hobbies or joy in anything anymore. 

I wake up with panic attacks, my body hurts physically for no reason, I feel touch starve, and I have punch to many walls to count. I'm jobless and living with my sister for the time being, and my family might as well be strangers at this point. I dont like anybody, I feel irritated all the time and the idea of working endlessly just to be stuck in the same place forever scares me more then knowing I'll die.

I have a plan for my death but might take a while, I need a gun first which I'll be getting one with my dad since he needs to go to the armory to get his own gun check and also to help me buy one. Easy since he is oblivious to my problems not that I want him to know it. Next is deciding where to go, I like to killmyself some place more natural or open and empty. I'm thinking of going on a road trip for places like the great canyon or other national parks. I dont have any desire to keep living a life I know will lead to lonelyness and nothingness. I want to end it. I just need the courage and motivation to do it, which is hard when you suffer from depression.

I just know that I don't have much money, so if I commit I can't backdown anymore.

Hopefully I'll have fun on the road before hand, don't want to leave this world without enjoying what I wanted to do when I came to this country, living on the road and becoming a road nomad. Though without money or a job that gets you that is impossible and would lead to disaster.

Exact_Suggestion305,My anxiety has consumed me.,"I've been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. First it started as mild social anxiety. The fear of socialization led me to isolate myself. That isolation caused my first depressive episode. Years later, I have a disorder called hypochondria (health anxiety). This causes me to always think there is something seriously wrong with my body. Like at any moment I will be diagnosed with terminal cancer, or my heart will suddenly stop. This mixed with OCD and depression has caused me to go insane. I am on a decent dose of Zoloft and it has done nothing for me. I've tried therapy, medication, and all of the self help exercises. It feels like this is something medication won't be able to fix. There is no point in checking myself into a psychiatric hospital, since all they will do is get me stable on medication that most likely will not work. I no longer have goals or aspirations. There is nothing I am looking forward to in life. I haven't felt happy in a very long time. There is no point in living like this. I don't know what to do. No one in my life cares about my mental health anymore. I have been talking about it for so long that it doesn't worry anyone anymore. I have tried everything to stop this hell. Every minute of every day I am worried about something. I have a difficult time sleeping as well. I am too scared to actually commit. I don't want my family to have to deal with my death.

altaccounttohide,"While losing hope that I’ll ever have a “redemption arc” for my life, how can I make life feel more worth living?","I don’t wanna kill myself. I can actually be frustratingly stuck in between “not wanting to kill myself, but wanting to die” too much of the time. I’m afraid of death, and I’m too afraid to go through with any of the methods to kill myself. I don’t wanna be in any pain or risk not successfully dying. 

But, I’m so tired of waiting for the day when God or something sees that I’ve “suffered enough” to deserve my life turning around. You hear about this sort of thing a lot in stories of recoveries, or even stories of how famous people GOT famous. They hit their lowest lows, and then things turn around. I feel like I’ve been at my lowest lows countless times, but the best I get is that things return to whatever low norm they were at the next day, except I’m not sobbing about it anymore.

I’m so bored with how I am. I want to do a lot more, but don’t know how. I’m so hungry for validation that I’ve tried to become known on social media numerous times, but it’s fallen flat and led me repeatedly to look like a sad try-hard. I don’t wanna care about what people think of me anymore, but it’s like it’s engrained in my DNA.

I miss everyone and miss having connections, but my social anxiety makes it to where I avoid everyone except my bf. I miss my family, but I can’t call because phone calls make me wanna crawl out of my skin. I don’t text as regularly as I need to, and I’m not sure why. I can’t become closer to people because I don’t feel natural around them. I’m scared of them, and need a comfort person around in order to not feel so awkward that I feel like crying.

I live with the constant feeling of obligation to make up for my shortcomings. For example, I worry about people I avoid due to social anxiety feeling like I hate them, so I feel the need to try to hang out with them all the time, or make some grand gesture to prove that I don’t. But, that just puts even more pressure on me all the time, and makes me feel even worse. 

I’m tired of trying to convince some family members that I still love and care for them, even if I have trouble keeping in touch. But, if I loved them so much, why do I keep having so much trouble? I can’t live with the guilt of this. It’s too much. They’ll die thinking I didn’t even like them that much. 

I don’t feel like I have a real purpose other than to be a sickly person that depends on and ruins other people. But, I also don’t wanna die. I’m actually worried that the way I’m living and eating will kill me, but it’s the only way I cope right now, and I won’t stop (yet). I don’t get it. Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel? Do I have to keep living like this?

greygnarly,"I’ve ruined my own life, I’m isolated, and I think I’m ready to do it.","I can’t put it all down here. I’ve ruined my relationship with my mother, I’m a disappointment, I’m failing freshman year of college, I’m isolated, I’m ugly, none of my projects or pursuits are working out, I feel numb, I’m disgusted with myself, and it’s my own fault.  I feel like I deserve this.  I can’t keep being a burden to my family. I have no friends.  I’m alone and can’t talk to anyone. I embarrass my family. I’m a failure.  My hygiene is deteriorating. I haven’t brushed my teeth in weeks, my hair is greasy, I can’t sleep or I sleep too much. It’s embarrassing how awfully I handle everything that happens to me.  

I got drunk for the first time on spring break.  A drunk man offered to sleep with me, I didn’t go for it. I told my roommate about it.  She laughed and said I should have gone for it, because no one else would ever be stupid enough to sleep with me. I can’t stop thinking about it.

I want to be mad at my parents for disliking me but it’s all my fault and I don’t mean that for attention, it’s just that it is. I’m abrasive and unmotivated and the shame I feel being myself is too much now.  My face is red all the time because I’m so flushed with shame.  I feel swollen.  Pathetic. I want to crawl away and die and I want everyone I’ve ever met to forget me.  I’m so sorry to everyone I’ve hurt. I can’t take it back but I can prevent it going forward.

I go to a state university and my house is thirty minutes away. Incidentally, the attic in that house has a door to it which is accessible through my bedroom only.  There’s a huge beam running horizontally across the upper space of the attic.  If I open that door and stand on my tip toes I can reach the beam.  There’s about a two foot drop from the floor of my room down into the attic space.  I’ve tested it and the beam holds my weight.  I can dangle from it with both arms fully extended and my feet don’t come close to touching the ground. I’m going to hang myself from that beam soon.  Before the semester’s up.  I’m so sorry but I’m tired of waiting and I can’t be like this anymore.  I’ve tried to change and I can’t.  I don’t even know what’s wrong with me.  I can’t do anything I like anymore.  Even if I try to read a book or play a game, it doesn’t matter anymore, I feel nothing, enjoy nothing.  I feel like someone died inside me and Im moving around their body.

I would have just run my car off the road but I can’t imagine putting my family in that kind of financial situation.  I’ll leave a note.  I hope when they die it all goes quick and that they don’t have a funeral.  I’ll clean up before I go and make sure it’s easy to pack my stuff.  I hope it gets donated to someone who needs stuff.

thekingkong02,Seriously considering suicide due to an awful situation and desperately need advice,"Hi, thanks for reading. I know this is not an advice sub but I desperately need some from a stranger. Any really.

(post below)

Not sure if I was sexually coerced abroad (19m), think I have an STD - may have passed it onto my girlfriend (20). Please help.

I’ll just start with the fact that this is probably the most difficult thing that has happened to me in my life. I have had nightmares for two weeks since the event and I can’t get any sleep; my daylight hours are consumed with guilt and I am seriously considering suicide. (Have written a note, and made a rough timeframe).

I was recently on holiday in Havana, and was searching for food alone around 1am, very intoxicated. For those who know Havana - there is a street where prostitutes hang out, unfortunately its one of the only places you can get a pizza that late. Here is where it gets blurry - I remember walking back to my apartment and being approached by three prostitutes. They brought me to someones bed (not mine) where i remember receiving fellatio (cant remember if there was a condom). I remember having an erection but being unable to finish. I barely remember getting home, but I still had my phone and wallet but when I checked in the morning my wallet was missing all its cash (around 60 euros).

I’m not sure it was not consensual. I did not report the event to police because i’m not sure 1) they would do anything 2) I have desperately tried to forget it ever happened. I love my girlfriend more than anyone in the world and tried to forget it happened but I cannot. She means so much to me and I’d never thought of cheating before but I just can’t remember my thought process no matter how many times I relive it. I’m so scared that I consented. I know that I’m responsible for the actions of drunk me.

Recently my testicles have started itching more than usual and sometimes it stings slightly to pee (no redness). I have had sex with my girlfriend within the time I got back (with a condom vaginally, but not orally) as I didn’t want her to know what happened and think I cheated. I feel really really awful knowing that I could have passed this disease on to her and all I want is for her to be alright. To me suicide seems like the only plausible way out, as I can’t see myself living life without her and this will undoubtedly fundamentally change how she sees me.

I don’t know what to do… Any advice would be appreciated, shit or not.",kingkong 02 hi thanks reading know advice sub desperately need stranger really post sure wa sexually coerced abroad 19m think std may passed onto girlfriend 20 please help start fact probably difficult thing ha happened life nightmare two week since event get sleep daylight hour consumed guilt seriously considering suicide written note made rough timeframe wa recently holiday havana wa searching food alone around 1am intoxicated know havana street prostitute hang unfortunately one place get pizza late get blurry remember walking back apartment approached three prostitute brought someone bed mine remember receiving fellatio cant remember wa condom remember erection unable finish barely remember getting home still phone wallet checked morning wallet wa missing cash around 60 euro sure wa consensual report event police sure 1 would anything 2 desperately tried forget ever happened love girlfriend anyone world tried forget happened cannot mean much never thought cheating remember thought process matter many time relive scared consented know responsible action drunk recently testicle started itching usual sometimes sting slightly pee redness sex girlfriend within time got back condom vaginally orally want know happened think cheated feel really really awful knowing could passed disease want alright suicide seems like plausible way see living life without undoubtedly fundamentally change see know advice would appreciated shit seriously considering suicide due awful situation desperately need advice

thatskeletondude,I'm starting to be less and less scared that I'm not scared at all,"Like a lot of you, I'm very lonely. 

Lonely enough that, lately, I've been taking walks to try and get my mind off things a bit. It's helping a little, and getting out there and just walking for miles and miles has been something to look forward to now for the first time in a long time. 

Thing is, there's a bridge that I like to stop at and rest. Every time I walk into it, and I stop, and I look down, I think about how easy it would be to just jump off into the water and be done with it all. It's high enough that it would definitely kill me. 

This morning, right as the sun was first starting to peek out, I started off on my walk. When I got to the bridge, I stopped for way too long - an hour maybe. After a while, it went from ""Maybe it might be okay"", to ""I'm sure it wouldn't be that bad"", to ""It would be over before you knew what hit you"". 

Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I'm getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. 

I've been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. 

I'm finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. 

I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. 

Now, as I write all this down, and I'm getting progressively more drunk, I'm getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, _really_ good inside.",skeleton dude like lot lonely lonely enough lately taking walk try get mind thing bit helping little getting walking mile mile ha something look forward first time long time thing bridge like stop rest every time walk stop look think easy would jump water done high enough would definitely kill morning right sun wa first starting peek started walk got bridge stopped way long hour maybe went maybe might okay sure bad would knew hit strangely sudden feeling acceptance came first time year felt calm peace feeling unsettled point questioning entire view life getting day drunk home writing whatever reason process guess researching apparently jump immediately regret survivor tell happy alive wa cathartic moment thing finally started make sense finding time sit le daunting whole thing think letting go free falling resigning whatever fate lie ahead might best thing could either die one last regret deal way live maybe newfound perspective write getting progressively drunk getting feeling one nice little walk might lead happy ending soon make feel really _really_ good inside starting le le scared scared

spicytacoburryto,Feeling su1c1dal. idek what's happening,"TW: // h*mophobia, mention of getting st@bbed.

I'm just going through really hard time. I don't even know what to say about it. 

But yesterday i felt really suicidal. I never felt this much of suicidal before. 

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD-C, and everything made sense in life. But my parents are still not understanding about how mentally tolling it can be. I told my parents that have been feeling burnout for past 9 months and they just seem to take it lightly. I was in depression, and always had chronic anxiety issues which were all fueled by my untreated and undetected ADHD for all these years. 

My parents are actually really nice and always encourage me to open up, but it's all stupid because they end up blaming me for not trying harder. My anxiety which I had since I was kid always made it difficult for me to have friends. I do not even have siblings to share stuff with. 

I cannot share or talk about my problems that are actually troubling me to my parents with complete honesty because they don't understand and end up telling me to fix my schedule or some stupid shit that definitely wouldn't work for adhd minds. 
Because of that i atleast try to gain comfort from them by talking about other stuff that gives me pleasure like talking about favourite serie or charecter, but they ALWAYS tell me that I'm getting distracted again, and that should delete my Social media and stuff. 

Also yesterday, i asked my mom if, she  would accompany to pride parade if that happened in our city. And she started nagging, ""i told you to delete Instagram, you are supposed to study,.... Delete that rn!"" which clearly shows that she was trying to avoid that talk. So I'm really not left with a space where can talk about anything comfortably with them. The fact that she is internally h*mophobic puts me through so much stress. And everytime I talk about something deep, it always ends up with her telling me to study. I teared up. My dad, is mostly unavailable at home because of his work, all we do is little chit chat. And never had a chance to talk deeply about my personal issues, like i can do with my mom (who's housewife) even tho that doesn't end up well. 

Since I took an academic gap year, all my friends already promoted to next year's classes, left city and i have completely lost contact with them. Its been two years since i haven't really went outside to fresh my mind and enjoy myself. I can't do that, because my parents don't allow me to go anywhere alone and I don't even have a valid reason to.

Also I'm realising that even tho my parents have been always nice to me, they are always restricting my freedom. I'm F18 for godsake, and i still don't have control over my decisions. They are mostly made on my behalf by my mom. I can't even recharge my Mobile plans, i have to ask my mom every time to do it. And she would always excuse that ""it's waste of money use wifi instead"" and say ""you don't call or get calls from your friends anyway"". Like, sure wifi works but that'd mean i can't really go outside since i struggle with anxiety and always need music to cope. I don't even know details of my own band acc or cards, and so I can't do something on my own without asking my parents about it. This all might sound ridiculous but i really don't know any other way to cope. 


And so my coping options were reduced to my alone time in my room which helps me organise my intrusive thoughts, nice people on instagram, reddit forums and music. 


But yesterday, these all were breached. My parents are not emotionally supportive, unsafe to confide in and almost indifferent to my ADHD situation even tho they atleast provide with meds. I'm not on therapys. I do not have friends. My mom's homophobic undertone when i tried to seek least bit of comfort is just so hurtful. The wifi wasn't working well and my mom refused to recharge my phone, which meant no music, reddit or Instagram which gives me best comfort space i can afford.  And my parents intruded in my personal space yesterday which is crucial to me especially when i feel unstable and wanted to write my thoughts down privately. 

I went to bathroom and cried. And next thing that came to my mind was to go upstairs on terrace and then kiss the ground. Right before when i slept at 4:45am (i have very shitty sleep schedule bec of my adhd) i saw a flash in head where someone st@bbed me in my stomach and then hugged me, and i felt great and said ""thank you, this feels awesome"". I was kinda horrified and mad at myself for having such stupid intrusive thought. I woke up late today at 11am,  and was veryy tired and felt like i would collapse any second. Slept for another 2½ hours and saw a dream where i told my mom to kill me. And then she got mad at me for always talking about negetive stuff. I woke up feeling half dead. 

So yeah this all happened. And- idek where am I supposed to go.. .

I subconsciously keep hoping to die of natural causes or somehow go into vegetative state. 

Half of my problems would have been solved if i didn't have ADHD.

Many-Entertainer9692,"After a year of battle, I've lost. Everything is gone. I've now chosen to peaceful option","I've lost my job, the job I loved dearly. After they found out I was an addict I can't return. I can never find the same job.

I also got kicked out of college, no way I can turn back.



I've been a burden to my mother and my father. I've infected them with my depression they were unable to heal. I know my death my hurt them, but it will be better for them in the long run. Just like pouring alcohol on an infected wound, it will hurt really badly first, but it will heal it in the long run.


I have no friends left, I've tried for 4 years, only one. And she was more than I could ever ask. But she's gone, because I fucked up. I squeezed her to the point that she left, I don't blame her. I loved her, she was my best friend. And she was the first and only person to say that to me, ""I love you bestie"". Now, she blocked me, she was my last thing I tried living for. She's gone. I have her all I had, and she gave me what I want, what I needed. Now, she's gone. If you see this BB, it's not your fault. Please don't blame my disappeance or death on yourself. It isn't, you held me together, like you held me in your arms a few days ago before you left. You were the best thing that happened to me, and those best memories that I've had with you will be the last thing I will remember before my death. Though I'm not sure if you still love me after what I did, I still did.


Today was the first time I felt grief. I thought I did before, but, the pain I felt today, was nothing like anything I felt. Felt worse than waking up after my surgery after the anesthesia technician forgot to give me morphine. It felt worse than when the needle hit my nerve during a blood draw.
I felt the true meaning of a heart break. I thought it was a metaphor, or an exaggeration. But, it wasn't. I felt the grief in my chest, my breaths felt empty. My heartbeat felt unreal. The pain, the chest pain when I was crying. I didn't know that could happen.


I've decided to go missing today, run away from my parents, find a hotel far away spend my last days drinking and eating my favourite food, then finding erernal peace.


I appreciate if you want to convince me otherwise, but I've already decided. I don't want anything better, I just want my friend back, and maybe build my life. But, that's impossible. I've tried therapy, medications, groups, suicide lines. Nothing can fix it.

If you want to help. I'd love if someone could comfort me through my last days here, I always felt scared being alone. Id prefer if I didn't die lonely. Someone I could talk about my happiest memories, my biggest regrets. My deepest secrets. I plan on dying on Monday, if not anything early if they find me.

I think I fought bravely. I endured unimaginable hardships. But sadly it wasn't enough. There is nothing to run or fight from. And nothing to surrender to. So, it's best I cease.

Vuxlort,End of my road,"I'm at the end of the relatively short rollercoaster of a road that has been my life. For years, I could go along as safe and sound as anything, filled with nothing but joy, optimism, and hopes for the landmarks that I believed lay ahead of me. Turns out, I was living with my head in the sand for my entire life. There's so much here for me, but I'm far too weak to embrace it all. I'm not equipped to live this life. My mind is trapped in a body that can't allow me to achieve my meaning, a body that taunts me with what I could've had if I wasn't me, a body that has caused me increasingly unbearable levels of despair and grief that has left me completely broken, and I'm not able to live like this anymore. There's no peace of mind on any of my living days anymore. It used to come and go, but for the past months, it has consumed me. I have fear, pain, tears, and I can't hide them anymore. I used to think that everything passes with time, and I found great comfort in that, but I just can't see that anymore for myself. I thought my road was going to be an indefinite rollercoaster, and if you asked me even a year ago if I would come to the end of my road on my own terms, I would've never believed you, and yet here I am. This is it for me. This is where I get off. My road over the past months has slowly and gradually become rougher, coarser, bumpier - it's not paved anymore, it's dust. There is no road ahead of me that I can see anymore, just a diminished line of dirt that vaguely resembles a trailing off into the distance. So, this is my goodbye, to anyone who cares. I was never going to be okay in this life.

Now call me a hypocrite, but...

Just want anyone who sees this to know that everything will work out. You've got your beautiful selves and a world to love others. The hardest part of everything will be over in the end. Everything passes with time, but you'll always remember the good things, and you'll be so much richer in your soul for having experienced them. The wonderful things will always remain. Be strong, be kind to yourself, be kind to those around you, and live the best life you can live while you're here on this gentle planet.

Maybe I'll cross paths with some of you beautiful people out there in my next life... 

That'd certainly put the biggest smile on my face, and that I will never doubt.",vu xl ort end relatively short rollercoaster road ha life year could go along safe sound anything filled nothing joy optimism hope landmark believed lay ahead turn wa living head sand entire life much far weak embrace equipped live life mind trapped body allow achieve meaning body taunt could body ha caused increasingly unbearable level despair grief ha left completely broken able live like anymore peace mind living day anymore used come go past month ha consumed fear pain tear hide anymore used think everything pass time found great comfort see anymore thought road wa going indefinite rollercoaster asked even year ago would come end road term would never believed yet get road past month ha slowly gradually become rougher coarser bumpier paved anymore dust road ahead see anymore diminished line dirt vaguely resembles trailing distance goodbye anyone care wa never going okay life call hypocrite want anyone see know everything work got beautiful self world love others hardest part everything end everything pass time always remember good thing much richer soul experienced wonderful thing always remain strong kind kind around live best life live gentle planet maybe cross path beautiful people next life certainly put biggest smile face never doubt end road
misshollykaizen,The desire to keep going (Thank you 🙏),"Dear reddit users,

I just want to say thankyou for helping me today, ive been really stupid and was planning on ending my life, even going as far as to enquire on r/heroin about how much I'd need for an overdose. Kind of ironic to be born into this world on such a drug only to leave on the same thing.

But after speaking with people there, here and my partner in Hungary. Something in me changed, I realized that all of this internalised pain and suffering. Was keeping me from progressing forward, while that sounds like a no-brainer. At the time it didn't quite register, that said this isn't what changed my mind.

Ive been quite irritable with my partner lately and have been pretty nasty and awful towards her, it was this coupled with the fact that I just need to keep busy and maybe have a hobby that finally made me see sense. Yes im still facing the same problems as before, the same fears and the same struggles. But now im ready to face them instead of running away.

Thankyou to all who have reached out and hopefully, this can be the start of something much more positive. Thankyou all and big hugs 💜",miss holly kai zen dear reddit user want say thankyou helping today ive really stupid wa planning ending life even going far enquire r heroin much need overdose kind ironic born world drug leave thing speaking people partner hungary something changed realized internalised pain suffering wa keeping progressing forward sound like brainer time quite register said changed mind ive quite irritable partner lately pretty nasty awful towards wa coupled fact need keep busy maybe hobby finally made see sense yes im still facing problem fear struggle im ready face instead running away thankyou reached hopefully start something much positive thankyou big hug desire keep going thank
RevolutionarySet9963,I'm tired of being tired and it's starting to reach a point I can't handle anymore.,"I feel almost completely empty. Getting out of bed is a task of itself if I can even sleep. The common thing to happen these last few months is I'll lay in bed for hours just trying to sleep. So tired and sleepy but my mind racing. Even when I do sleep my dreams are nightmares, not even normal scary stuff just my mind mocking me with dreams about things that remind me of my suffering. All I can think about is how miserable I am and how lonely and empty I feel. Then it continues to snowball until I think about killing myself. My only escape is work where I am not isolated, if I don't just not show up. I'm at a point in my life where I need to start thinking about how I'm going to make my living and become an adult. But it feels so overwhelming and I'd rather just keep going through the motions until I've exhausted myself to the point of not being afraid of death anymore. I wish I could stop thinking. I'm lost in my mind and I feel like I'm going to lose it. I have no friends and I don't have the energy to. I can't even communicate with my family or even honestly care about them much at all. I don't really care about anything. Not myself, not a future, and not anyone I'd consider loved ones. I did get out of a relationship a few months ago as well which did trigger this, but the feelings persisted long before and even were part of the reason it ended. The relationship did nothing but reduce already well established feelings I've had for years. I was hoping she would help me but only pushed me down further. I wasted my last bit of mental energy trusting her to help me. All I've done for years is go through the motions. Just barely enough to get by and have money to live. Now that I have no emotional support I am rotting away. I can't help myself. I can't feed myself. I can't even think about anything besides how much I hate being me.

plzstopamfragile,It’s hard to keep going,"I survived an attempt about 6 years ago now. I got out of the bad environment I was in, moved to the city on my own, finished my degrees, got a job, a partner (now fiancé), and I am succeeding. I’ve gained weight during covid, and my health isn’t the best, but other than that I am “doing well”. I get up and do my work, sometimes push myself too hard but I manage a fairly medium lifestyle now. My
place is a little bit messy, but not the worst. My social life is mediocre. Everything feels mediocre except for my animation job which honestly feels like one of the only reasons I am alive. 

However, even though I have come this far, and have been managing my depression symptoms, I have not been ok. I’ve become so good at masking that people don’t suspect anything, but it also feels like no one cares when I retreat and start to struggle. I self harm from time to time, and I still have suicidal thoughts very often. 

It’s the most confusing, tiring thing in the world to have worked so hard yet not feel any better. I am exhausted mentally, physically, emotionally. Socialising makes me extremely low, but so does being alone. All of the things I ever enjoyed just feel like work. It all feels like work and I’m so scared I will never feel ok again. 

Does anyone else feel this way? That the depression is there and just as bad as ever, but you “function” and therefore feel like you’re unworthy for help. Like doctors don’t take you seriously if you’re not bashing your head against a wall in front of them or putting on a show. I even showed them my self harm because I needed them to help dress it, but it was just really dry interactions. It feels like I’m too old now to struggle even though I’m 26. It feels like everyone expects the world of me because I set such a high standard. I’ve always been thrown in the deep end so that’s just what I got used to. What they don’t realise is that working hard is a coping mechanism. The success is tainted. Reaching out is so hard, but even when I do people tell me I’m the only one responsible for my feelings and life. And I know that, and I do, but the compassion and care would be nice, you know? I’m doing my best despite facing this every single day. 

I don’t even know if this is making sense. Or the point of this. I guess I’m just frustrated that I still have those suicidal thoughts and impulse when I am technically doing better. Even my first attempt, when I was released from hospital I sat outside alone crying because I had no one to come pick me up.",plz stop fragile survived attempt 6 year ago got bad environment wa moved city finished degree got job partner fiancé succeeding gained weight covid health best well get work sometimes push hard manage fairly medium lifestyle place little bit messy worst social life mediocre everything feel mediocre except animation job honestly feel like one reason alive however even though come far managing depression symptom ok become good masking people suspect anything also feel like one care retreat start struggle self harm time time still suicidal thought often confusing tiring thing world worked hard yet feel better exhausted mentally physically emotionally socialising make extremely low doe alone thing ever enjoyed feel like work feel like work scared never feel ok doe anyone else feel way depression bad ever function therefore feel like unworthy help like doctor take seriously bashing head wall front putting show even showed self harm needed help dress wa really dry interaction feel like old struggle even though 26 feel like everyone expects world set high standard always thrown deep end got used realise working hard coping mechanism success tainted reaching hard even people tell one responsible feeling life know compassion care would nice know best despite facing every single day even know making sense point guess frustrated still suicidal thought impulse technically better even first attempt wa released hospital sat outside alone cry one come pick hard keep going

i ruined my relationship with my ex and best friend of 7 years because i was terrified she'd abandon me like i always was. i hurt her so much. i will never forgive myself for that. I never meant to hurt her and i care about her so deeply. she meant to world to me and still does but i fucked it up. i love her so so much and want it to go back to normal but shes moved on. 

she treats me like im nothing now nd doesn't even want to see me. i miss when she was excited to talk to me and we were happy. i miss her so much even though i talk to her everyday. it doesnt feel like im talking to her it feels like im talking to a stranger. 

i want her to take me back so bad, doesn't even have to be romantically i just want to talk to my best friend again. 

i love her so much still and im so confused and hurt. im trying so hard to keep our friendship together but shes going to get tired eventually and then ill really be alone. 

my friends dont respond to me, they dont text me first, dont want to do anything with me. i get left on read asking to do things. none of them are irl by the way, i havent had a friend irl in years. 

i feel like a zoo animal pacing its cage. i cant take it anymore. i want to numb it all so bad but i cant. my post makes it sound like my only issue here is loneliness but it isnt, ive had to deal with such a crushing amount of issues my whole life but the loneliness is whats finally doing me in. 

I feel like i cant be alone or im going to finally do it. 

i just want somebody to hold me and tell me itll be okay. i want this all to end. i want to go back to my good family and feel like i have any presence at all to anyone. i want my dad to hug me and to tell him everything and to finally be at peace. i cant be left alone anymore. 

i dont know if i want to die. thats better than having a plan though. I first attempted at 10, again at 13. i just want to numb it all but i cant. i want to bash my head in because thats the only way i can stop this. whenever i get like this all i want to do is hit my head until it stops and sometimes thats what i do

i want someone to take care of me. i feel like a vulnerable child. im so scared.",plan aria hysteria im cripplingly lonely went go visit family couple week got feel real love care family felt weird hugged talked im back neglectful prison sit rot ive started cutting ive hitting head lot spend day wracked sob day end hate much ive ill life cant take anymore ruined beyond repair wa abused badly kid took away ability lead normal life hate ruined relationship ex best friend 7 year wa terrified abandon like always wa hurt much never forgive never meant hurt care deeply meant world still doe fucked love much want go back normal shes moved treat like im nothing nd even want see miss wa excited talk happy miss much even though talk everyday doesnt feel like im talking feel like im talking stranger want take back bad even romantically want talk best friend love much still im confused hurt im trying hard keep friendship together shes going get tired eventually ill really alone friend dont respond dont text first dont want anything get left read asking thing none irl way havent friend irl year feel like zoo animal pacing cage cant take anymore want numb bad cant post make sound like issue loneliness isnt ive deal crushing amount issue whole life loneliness whats finally feel like cant alone im going finally want somebody hold tell itll okay want end want go back good family feel like presence anyone want dad hug tell everything finally peace cant left alone anymore dont know want die thats better plan though first attempted 10 13 want numb cant want bash head thats way stop whenever get like want hit head stop sometimes thats want someone take care feel like vulnerable child im scared 17 feel like torture
Gorshiro,I feel so so lonely.,"No matter how much I try to be a good person everyone just seems to ignore me. I try to create conversation or join a conversation and I just get ignored. I try to message people to make friends but nobody every responds back. 


I have felt so hollow the past few years. I’m already anxious and depressed enough just trying to live my life. I’m just so tired and it hurts when people ignore me when I try to get out of my bubble of social anxiety.

I can’t even vent in most places without the fear of being hospitalized or people thinking I’m some kind of freak. Most places will just remove my post altogether but it’s not like actually trying to build meaningful relationships actually ever worked.

Puzzleheaded-Tune133,Didn't Ask to Be Born,"Long story short, I slacked around in high school (hated school) and I'm going to graduate with mediocre scores. Currently thinking of how funny life is. My parents are disappointed with me lazing around, but what the hell? I've never asked to be born. I would have been gone long time ago but I don't have the courage to find out whether hell is real.  

My mom talks about how people make mistakes. But I am the one who has to carry on life with the trauma she inflicted on me for the rest of my life. Cried &amp; hid in the toilet once after getting in an argument with her with her trying to break the toilet door down &amp; screaming at me to get out. Constantly hit as a form of punishment for my mistakes when I was only a toddler &amp; in elementary and would get humiliated by being scolded in public. 

In short, I never received any form of understanding for what I went through from my parents &amp; now my mom is saying that I need to stop victimizing myself because she went through worse being born as an unplanned child &amp; was neglected &amp; by her mother. Well, what the fuck though? Why... why did someone like my mom, who will probably never get proper treatment decided to have children? Fuck you, mom. Fuck you. 

Now my mom has been lecturing me of how my teachers have told her I have no drive &amp; passion in school. Well, what the hell do you expect to come out though from complaining about that? I don't understand. It's just so draining to work so hard for something I don't even care about. It doesn't help that my mom would nag about how she had the best scores in university but is currently only a housewife married to someone who had parents who treated her terribly. What a miserable life despite all the hard work.

My self esteem issues are honestly so bad, they were even worse when I was younger. I would constantly stutter &amp; would eat my lunch in the toilet during lunch times in fear of having to interact with other people. It did not help that there was this one jerk who once chased after me and aimed his water bottle on my head for something I didn't even do. My grades that time were even worse, and people gave up on me for being stupid. That was also the reason why so many people avoided me so I was lonely for a very long time.

Honestly, I'm just feeling horrible right now, crying about how my life is going to start going downhill after I graduate. My parents (my mom in particular) is constantly complaining about how I'm not trying hard (I'm not denying that) &amp; how life will be harder, that I'm too relaxed for someone who hasn't been trying hard enough to apply to universities. But what is the point when my parents don't really support me in my own choices? I don't feel like I have control over my own life anyway. I'm not allowed to go out of my shitty developing country to take majors I actually would actually care about.

I'm honestly trying to aim being ""forced"" in a gap year to reflect in my life. I don't know if I'll be prepared for the amount of scolding or naggings by my parents, but I think if I continue down the path they want me to take I'm pretty sure I'll try to kill myself. I feel horrible &amp; pathetic about myself when I read the problems of other people who are going through way much worse, I just feel I'm not prepared or ready to take whatever life throws at me. I'm too tired to think about anything or rather, I don't want to think about anything anymore.",puzzle headed tune 133 long story short slacked around high school hated school going graduate mediocre score currently thinking funny life parent disappointed lazing around hell never asked born would gone long time ago courage find whether hell real mom talk people make mistake one ha carry life trauma inflicted rest life cried amp hid toilet getting argument trying break toilet door amp screaming get constantly hit form punishment mistake wa toddler amp elementary would get humiliated scolded public short never received form understanding went parent amp mom saying need stop victimizing went worse born unplanned child amp wa neglected amp mother well fuck though someone like mom probably never get proper treatment decided child fuck mom fuck mom ha lecturing teacher told drive amp passion school well hell expect come though complaining understand draining work hard something even care help mom would nag best score university currently housewife married someone parent treated terribly miserable life despite hard work self esteem issue honestly bad even worse wa younger would constantly stutter amp would eat lunch toilet lunch time fear interact people help wa one jerk chased aimed water bottle head something even grade time even worse people gave stupid wa also reason many people avoided wa lonely long time honestly feeling horrible right cry life going start going downhill graduate parent mom particular constantly complaining trying hard denying amp life harder relaxed someone trying hard enough apply university point parent really support choice feel like control life anyway allowed go shitty developing country take major actually would actually care honestly trying aim forced gap year reflect life know prepared amount scolding naggings parent think continue path want take pretty sure try kill feel horrible amp pathetic read problem people going way much worse feel prepared ready take whatever life throw tired think anything rather want think anything anymore ask born

kaydanbotu,Not sure if actually suicidal or just addicted to doomscrolling,"I've been having some occasional suicidal thoughts ever since puberty hit, but it's only gotten really intense recently. I'm 20 now and I've spent the last few weeks scrolling through suicide related subreddits, reading depressing crap all day and wallowing in self-pity.

I'm reading so many suicide-related posts partly just to pass the time and partly because it's nice to be able to relate to people online. But I'm not sure if I actually want to kill myself. Yes, I want to die. Yes, I'm tired of life. But I've never actually gone past the point of contemplating suicide, never actually made concrete plans let alone chosen a specific method I want to pursue one day. Nothing. Just thoughts and hypothetical scenarios.

I feel like a coward for being like this. Sometimes I think to myself ""why don't you just do it?"" and I feel like a loser who can't do anything, not even end his own life even though he wants to. Does anyone relate?

Edit: fixed some typos and wording",kay dan bot u occasional suicidal thought ever since puberty hit gotten really intense recently 20 spent last week scrolling suicide related subreddits reading depressing crap day wallowing self pity reading many suicide related post partly pas time partly nice able relate people online sure actually want kill yes want die yes tired life never actually gone past point contemplating suicide never actually made concrete plan let alone chosen specific method want pursue one day nothing thought hypothetical scenario feel like coward like sometimes think feel like loser anything even end life even though want doe anyone relate edit fixed typo wording sure actually suicidal addicted doomscrolling

reddback6,does this make any sense to you?,"In hospital, talked to psychiatrist, told him, even wrote him about a specific antidepressant I've been looking up. The experiences people have had, side effects, positives etc.

I am/was a heavy drinker. Every night. I told him if I get put on this medication it could motivate me in so many way. Ways that all these testimonies can vouch for. He just keeps blaming the alcohol for all my problems and says we need to wait for me to go to rehab before we start a new drug. Btw he took me off one of my antidepressants, at my request.

So now the plan is, send me home, down to one antidepressant, where there is currently nobody staying at ATM, all alone, could drink as much as I want and possibly kill myself. Rehab could take up to a month for an open bed.

I just don't see the logic. Ok, if I take the antidepressant and I fall into a relapse it might not work. Even if I don't drink, it still might not work. But so what? Even if that's the case what harm could there be in trying it? The worst thing that could happen is it just doesn't work.

Do people think that calling suicidal people stupid or less of a human prevent them from actually ending it all? In my case, it made me go into questioning whether it was worth it? 
When someones dies, not only do they end the pain but also start it in others. But what if it's not like that for me? What if they laugh? Have they been laughing behind my back about me and my 'issues'? I know some that do.  

I'm too soft to wish that they die a slow death or one similar to mine. God why do I care so much?? They don't care about me so why do I care about them? I don't even know their real name, it's merely a pseudonym. I don't understand them and I don't understand myself.

Immediate_Face_2711,(I Know I’ve Posted Multiple Times But I Recently Did It Again And Now I’ve Completely Lost It.) I [15 M] From Canada Used To Message People On Reddit For Sexy Roleplaying Chats Ans Now I Can’t Live With Myself. Thinking about killing myself tonight.,"
Sorry for the long post and I’m kind of new to this so I don’t know how to do the whole TL;DR thing, I’m sorry. 

Btw I know I’ve posted this a bunch of times and this will be the last. The reason I’m posting this more recently was that I was ashamed to admit that I started doing this again but then realized my career choice, so yea sorry for the multiple posts. 

Ok, first of all, I know that this isn’t an excuse or anything but because of the pandemic, online learning, and other stuff, I just kind of got bored and lonely and I guess I just started going on Reddit looking for something fun and found these NSFW SubReddits and people messaging me, I don’t know honestly, I was just bored and lonely. I never had any friends in school (and still don’t and get bullied quite often and never stand up for myself) because I’m shy and just overall weird and different from other people (bisexual even though no one knows I just feel different that I like men and women), and I absolutely hate my parents, we don’t agree on anything ever, they’re always in my space, constantly putting pressure on me, and I hate when they say racist and homophobic things (and I can’t stand up for myself because all of a sudden I have no voice and an attitude problem). I understand that they want me to do good in school and life but I just, I just can’t stand them. So basically what I did was I started talking to these people on Reddit, lying to them about basically everything (Age, sex, etc)  (I never gave any of my personal info btw) and what I feel the most shittiest about is that I sometimes received pics and sent pictures of other people from other SubReddits and said they were mine. I realized that what I was doing was wrong and really disgusting, so I got rid of that account, but a couple months ago I found what I wanted to be in life and when I grow up and that is a FBI Special Agent (I know I have to get US citizenship and denounce my Canadian one, and I’m aware of the other requirements), but I feel like I did something illegal, and I’ve also heard they ask that question in the polygraph. I also feel like I’ve ruined everyone that I talked to lives as well by lying to them that I’m an adult when I’m younger than 18. I’m afraid this will affect my future and career aspiration. I have deleted everything, but still, I just, can’t live with myself. At night I just think that if I end it, my family would have less of a burden, I don’t have to think about this, and I can start over. I feel like I’ve gotten closer to it everyday, with school people watching me eat lunch alone etc and now this, I just, can’t take it.

MeliosakiSama,I’m tired of it all,"My siblings have always been jerks to me even as children, they would gang up on me and insult me as a group and when I try to confront them they just laugh it off… My father has always stopped them whenever things get serious. My dad passed away 2 years ago and the bullying has gotten more serious and more constant, everyday they insult me make rude insensitive jokes about me.

My older sister is 20 years old but she acts like a 13 year old child I bet even 13 year olds nowadays are far more mature than her. She stole around 700+ CAD from my mom and also stole her jewelry and clothes. She also steals from our neighbours, She steals for the fun of stealing not because she needs anything, she always insults me, she calls me useless etc and she always says that i was mixed up from birth just because my skin is darker than hers and my brothers.

My brother 18 years old is just like my sister but worse. He calls me a men toucher on a daily basis he also says I watch cp when I obviously don’t……..
He’s a high school drop out and he is also jobless and he is obese… not only is he jobless he always steals money from my mom and he makes her cry every night. He used my moms debit card without her permission to buy a 800$+ phone… not only did he do those things without apologizing he takes my mom car at night like 2 am and comes back at 7 and that gets my mom really stressed she can’t even sleep at night without fearing that her money or car would get taken, one day he left without my moms permission with her car and guess what he crashed my moms 9k$ car and now he’s demanding her to buy a new one…… He went out of the city with a G3 license and now he got his license suspended and now my mom has to pay 4 grand just to get it back, he’s not even working to fix his mistake. 

He and my sister are incredibly passive aggressive even when I’m not even in the same room as them they insult me, they talk out loud without a care in the world so I could easily hair them, they even backbite constantly they always say I’m garbage I’m useless I’m this and I’m that and I’m tired of it all I’m tired of the constant bullying I’m tired of them always trying to make me the bad guy….

I’m just a 15 year old Male trying to focus on my studies and life but their constant bullying makes it incredibly hard for me to just live normally I have contemplated suicide multiple times but I can’t even do that because in my religion (Islam) suicide is a really serious major sin, I just want them to stop bullying me constantly I just want to live a decent life…… I’m just tired of it all.

If anybodies asking about my mom well she works a 11 To 8 PM job so she can’t really help me from the bullying but whenever she is home she helps but she’s a diabetic 40 year old that’s struggling to even walk properly so I don’t want to stress her anymore because of my suicidal thoughts..

My older brother drops me off at school and he picks me up a hour or 2 when school ends and what makes it difficult is that he forces me to walk to a bank or kfc for no reason whatsoever, when he picks me up with my sister he just becomes a complete jerk he wouldn’t let me enter the car that day I was so pissed I just gave up and walked 1 hour+ home and my mom was at work and there was nothing she could do.

Right now I’m contemplating if I would Rather commit suicide or run away from home because I can’t take even one more day in this hell.",lio saki sama sibling always jerk even child would gang insult group try confront laugh father ha always stopped whenever thing get serious dad passed away 2 year ago bullying ha gotten serious constant everyday insult make rude insensitive joke older sister 20 year old act like 13 year old child bet even 13 year old nowadays far mature stole around 700 cad mom also stole jewelry clothes also steal neighbour steal fun stealing need anything always insult call useless etc always say wa mixed birth skin darker brother brother 18 year old like sister worse call men toucher daily basis also say watch cp obviously high school drop also jobless obese jobless always steal money mom make cry every night used mom debit card without permission buy 800 phone thing without apologizing take mom car night like 2 come back 7 get mom really stressed even sleep night without fearing money car would get taken one day left without mom permission car guess crashed mom 9k car demanding buy new one went city g3 license got license suspended mom ha pay 4 grand get back even working fix mistake sister incredibly passive aggressive even even room insult talk loud without care world could easily hair even backbite constantly always say garbage useless tired tired constant bullying tired always trying make bad guy 15 year old male trying focus study life constant bullying make incredibly hard live normally contemplated suicide multiple time even religion islam suicide really serious major sin want stop bullying constantly want live decent life tired anybodies asking mom well work 11 8 pm job really help bullying whenever home help diabetic 40 year old struggling even walk properly want stress anymore suicidal thought older brother drop school pick hour 2 school end make difficult force walk bank kfc reason whatsoever pick sister becomes complete jerk let enter car day wa pissed gave walked 1 hour home mom wa work wa nothing could right contemplating would rather commit suicide run away home take even one day hell tired

misshollykaizen,Considering/Planning,"So ive been trying to get help for years, its too long of a story to go into. But to give you an idea of how apathetic and incompetent the mental health services are in my area, the last contact I had was my GP (over the phone) who told me...

""You don't sound like your depressed""

Despite me exhibiting all the signs, which for me are;

-Im bed all the time, zero energy to do anything
-Trouble sleeping/eating
-Frequent thoughts/feelings of hopelessness
-Short term memory loss

Only a month ago I was taken to hospital and assesed by a mental health professional, I told them that im planning to take my life by means of overdose. But no follow up or treatment was given, although to be honest...after three years of being left unchecked and untreated, going round and round in circles with professionals who make excuses as to why they can't help you. Id had enough.

Two years ago I lost my best friend to suicide, she was in the room next to me as she was overdosing. There was nothing I could do to stop her. Five days following her being put on life support, she died. She was someone who once talked me off the ledge, but she still took her life. Now I want to do the same. As a Trans-woman, I constantly feel like the world hates me. Like they see me as a parisite or something thats subhuman.

More and more people are starting to see people like me as degenerate, but all I wanted to do was live my life. I don't impose my choices onto others, nor demand anyone use my pronouns. I have my own rules but expect no one else to live by them, its a really peaceful way to be. If we all lived like this, the world would be just as peaceful too. On the subject of peace, let me tell you about mine.

Anytime I've decided (truly decided) to go ahead with making preparations to end my life, an overwhelming sense of serenity and peace washes over me. Its the happiest feeling ive had since I was 6 years old and im 32 now. People have told me time after time to get help, and trust me ive really tried. The sad reality is, the mental health services in my area are under funded, under staffed and can only treat those most in need.

That being said many whom I've met have no emotional understanding of you, some of them are even downright abusive towards you. And can I prove it? No. And that's how they get away with this. Needless to say, im not looking for help. I simply came here to tell you how I feel. Because id rather have 6 months to a few years happiness than 3 more decades of misery. 

But suicide is no easy task, especially for those who I'm about to hurt. That being said, the human heart has an amazing capacity to heal, my friends and what little family I have left will heal with time. They will move on and find a way to live with what I did, that's just how human beings are.

I'm sorry this post was morbid, in a way I feel better for saying it. But I want you to bear something in mind before attempting to talk me down. In a recent episode of Doctor who aired in 2020. The Doctor asks the master...

""And has it calmed all the rage?"" 

The master replies...

""I don't think anything will ever do that""",miss holly kai zen ive trying get help year long story go give idea apathetic incompetent mental health service area last contact wa gp phone told sound like depressed despite exhibiting sign im bed time zero energy anything trouble sleeping eating frequent thought feeling hopelessness short term memory loss month ago wa taken hospital assesed mental health professional told im planning take life mean overdose follow treatment wa given although honest three year left unchecked untreated going round round circle professional make excuse help id enough two year ago lost best friend suicide wa room next wa overdosing wa nothing could stop five day following put life support died wa someone talked ledge still took life want trans woman constantly feel like world hate like see parisite something thats subhuman people starting see people like degenerate wanted wa live life impose choice onto others demand anyone use pronoun rule expect one else live really peaceful way lived like world would peaceful subject peace let tell mine anytime decided truly decided go ahead making preparation end life overwhelming sense serenity peace wash happiest feeling ive since wa 6 year old im 32 people told time time get help trust ive really tried sad reality mental health service area funded staffed treat need said many met emotional understanding even downright abusive towards prove get away needle say im looking help simply came tell feel id rather 6 month year happiness 3 decade misery suicide easy task especially hurt said human heart ha amazing capacity heal friend little family left heal time move find way live human sorry post wa morbid way feel better saying want bear something mind attempting talk recent episode doctor aired 2020 doctor asks master ha calmed rage master reply think anything ever considering planning

I want to let go and have my freedom again. To be able to actually fall asleep and stay asleep, to be able eat normally. To be able to do anything I want without nearly collapsing daily. To be out of this body and in one that at least doesn’t have all that I have. 

Please don’t try to give me false hope. One of the things people who aren’t chronically ill need to learn is that telling someone who’s chronically ill that “it gets better” is completely pointless. I’m only getting worse, and getting more diagnoses. I’m so tired and barely hanging on, and anyone who loves me can thank whatever fucking GOD there is that my mom exists, because she is truly the only reason I’m here. I don’t want to cause them pain.

I know this would shatter my mom and I can’t do that to her. I can’t imagine MY life without her, I’d simply stop living if she died so I can’t imagine how it would be for her if I went through with it.
But I’m so fucking tired.  Every day is pain, sickness, suffering. 
I cry so damn much and I have anxiety, depression and possibly ptsd from my health issues and I really don’t have a will to live.  All my chronic illnesses are incurable, and I definitely won’t live to see the day that they can be cured, so I’m stuck with this.

All I know is that this isn’t a way to live. I don’t do school, I had to drop out because of my health. I barely have friends and the friends I do have have their own mental health issues so sometimes I go months without talking to them because they have to deal with it.  I barely go out. Im in pain and sick every single day and have been for 4 years and I’ve tried everything the doctors will provide me. There isn’t a solution in sight, and I don’t want to/cant keep holding onto false hope.

Id just be setting myself up for failure again and again. I want to end it all but my mom is the reason I don’t. I wish she didn’t love me so I could end it.",x tro brian 17f 4 chronic illness make life living hell phobia sick since wa 5 dealing illness fucking awful wanna end life badly love family know would break since already lost dad year ago know would shatter mom imagine life without simply stop living died imagine would went fucking tired every day pain sickness suffering cry damn much anxiety depression possibly ptsd health issue really live chronic illness incurable definitely live see day cured stuck know way live school drop health barely friend friend mental health issue sometimes go month without talking deal barely go im pain sick every single day 4 year tried everything doctor provide solution sight want cant keep holding onto false hope id setting failure want end mom reason wish love could end chronic illness

SafeSexChalupa69,If one more person I love dies I’m going to kill myself,"First my dad, then my best friend, and even though they aren’t technically dead, my dad’s entire family abandoned me, they refuse to acknowledge me, I’m a bad omen to them. I haven’t seen them since my dad died.

My dad was the only person I really had. My mom was a drunk, and was addicted to just about everything. Her and my stepdad would fight, and sleep forever leaving me in charge of my siblings. I was forced to grow up, but my dad still treated me like a kid, I was only fourteen, that’s how I was supposed to be treated! I wasn’t supposed to cook for a whole family, clean the entire house, and take care of two kids!!! He would let me vent, I could actually have a conversation with him. I loved him, I still do. Then my batshit mom decided to move away from our stepdad in another state!!! Nobody told my dad!!!! My dad got extremely sick. I was miles and miles away from him. My mom promised I’d see him again. He died. I didn’t even get to fucking see him for his birthday.

Kimmy, my best friend, died January 1st. I’m still grieving. I was the last person she talked to. Her texts were jumbled, she was overdosing “finally I’ll be free” her last message. I miss her so much, I loved her, every time I fucking see a kitkat bar I want to cry. I would call her kimkat, fuck!!!

I have a friend. They mean the world to me, they’re suicidal. I have panic attacks praying to God that when i wake up, he’ll still be here. I just talked him out of suicide, and I’m so scared. What if one day I don’t see his messages in time or something. I almost want to kill myself just to avoid the pain in case he does it. I cant lose another person, especially him. He means so much to me.",safe sex chal 69 first dad best friend even though technically dead dad entire family abandoned refuse acknowledge bad omen seen since dad died dad wa person really mom wa drunk wa addicted everything stepdad would fight sleep forever leaving charge sibling wa forced grow dad still treated like kid wa fourteen wa supposed treated supposed cook whole family clean entire house take care two kid would let vent could actually conversation loved still batshit mom decided move away stepdad another state nobody told dad dad got extremely sick wa mile mile away mom promised see died even get fucking see birthday kimmy best friend died january 1st still grieving wa last person talked text jumbled wa overdosing finally free last message miss much loved every time fucking see kitkat bar want cry would call kimkat fuck friend mean world suicidal panic attack praying god wake still talked suicide scared one day see message time something almost want kill avoid pain case doe cant lose another person especially mean much one person love dy going kill

icedhoneylavenderr,When will I stop thinking this way?,"I’m not sure if anyone else relates, but ever since I had my first serious period of depression and suicidal thoughts I feel like my brain just automatically reverts back to that place whenever I’m down. I’ve always kinda thought of suicide and maybe even wanted to die more on the surface level (you know typical angsty teen/young adult growing pains and emotional problems) but I never really considered it til about 6 months ago. For 3 months I prayed every night for something to happen to me and slowly started preparing for it until I caught myself and decided to seek medication before I did anything permanent. I don’t know what happened but since then I feel like I unlocked that thought my brain that most people keep locked. It’s like I’ve become desensitized to the thought of suicide. Even though my medication has helped, and I am doing better, the thought of killing myself still lingers. In my brain it’s kinda like “well that’s always an option” in a real -not joking kind of way - which I don’t think is normal. Now when I have bad days it really doesn’t take much to make me start thinking about it again. It’s like once I really considered it, it stayed with me. It’s rare for me now to have a day or moment where I think “actually no that would suck if I died right now”. Like I’m literally so indifferent about dying now and anything that gets added on makes me want to do it again. It feels almost inevitable like I’m just waiting for the day that it’ll all push me to the edge. And this isn’t conscious at all. As I’m typing this I feel pretty okay, but it’s something that I’ve noticed. My entire perception of life has completely changed. 

Has anyone else felt like this? How long did/has it lasted? Has it ever stopped (even temporarily)?",iced honey lavender r sure anyone else relates ever since first serious period depression suicidal thought feel like brain automatically reverts back place whenever always kinda thought suicide maybe even wanted die surface level know typical angsty teen young adult growing pain emotional problem never really considered til 6 month ago 3 month prayed every night something happen slowly started preparing caught decided seek medication anything permanent know happened since feel like unlocked thought brain people keep locked like become desensitized thought suicide even though medication ha helped better thought killing still lingers brain kinda like well always option real joking kind way think normal bad day really take much make start thinking like really considered stayed rare day moment think actually would suck died right like literally indifferent dying anything get added make want feel almost inevitable like waiting day push edge conscious typing feel pretty okay something noticed entire perception life ha completely changed ha anyone else felt like long ha lasted ha ever stopped even temporarily stop thinking way

No-Life-812,**trigger warning** three days ago almost ended my life and now wish I did end it.," 

I  was about to end my life and no idea why I didn't pull the trigger. 3  nights ago, I got drunk off my rear end. had a gun to my head and should  have pulled the trigger but didn't. just sat there shaking and bawling  to no end for hours.

I struggle  with C-PTSD, Severe Chronic Depression, Severe social anxiety, Paranoia,  adhd, minor brain damage and tons of other issues.

I  am 41, on disability, SSI to be exact got into streaming games online  for extra money but was told by SSI they consider it work and if I keep  pushing it, I will lose my SSI even though I don't make that much if  anything at all doing it.

I am  being sued by the housing authority for the apartments we live in for  mistakes that the landlords and managers made years ago and the housing  authority don't care. I rent a bedroom from my aunt and her son who  treat me horribly and abuse me and take advantage of me.

I  have 3 credit cards all 3 over the balance of 500 dollars. I am in a  total debt of 9.6k because of the 9k I am being sued for and the 500  plus on each credit card.

I bought a car a few years ago that was supposed to help me change my life only for the fact that I got scammed.

I  am also physically disabled now due to having arthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis in my lower back, knees, feet. meds sometimes don't help and  working out doesn't help one bit either.

I  have spent 10 years homeless and have had a family that severely  neglected me from the age of 5 and up. lost both parents in my early  20's. have no siblings or other family but my aunt and her son who treat  me horrible.

I have tried for the  past 10 years to get my own apartment based on income, find a room to  rent I could afford,, get a minivan to live in, to find a job I could  even online. but to no avail, only to get let down, rejected, mocked at,  made fun of etc. I am now in my 40's and all the work I have done in my  early 20's and 30's were just day labor cash under the table.

I  have never had a real job and at this point probably wouldn't even be  able to handle it because of my mental issues. It has been over 10 yrs  since I was last hugged, held, had anyone tell me they loved me even if  they didn't mean it.

I am so tired  of being alone and being single and never having been loved or have  affection and watching everyone else live the lives I dearly want to  live but can't acquire no matter how hard I try.

I  just wish I pulled the trigger 3 nights ago and ended it. I have  nothing left and at this point if anyone came into my life, I would  probably smother them with affection, love, touches, etc to the point  they would run away as fast as they came in to my life.

I  am dying for that physical connection with someone and just to have  that support that comes along with having a significant other. now I  know it wouldn't fix my issues but half of my issues is from being  single and alone for 4 decades.",life 812 wa end life idea pull trigger 3 night ago got drunk rear end gun head pulled trigger sat shaking bawling end hour struggle c ptsd severe chronic depression severe social anxiety paranoia adhd minor brain damage ton issue 41 disability ssi exact got streaming game online extra money wa told ssi consider work keep pushing lose ssi even though make much anything sued housing authority apartment live mistake landlord manager made year ago housing authority care rent bedroom aunt son treat horribly abuse take advantage 3 credit card 3 balance 500 dollar total debt 9 6k 9k sued 500 plus credit card bought car year ago wa supposed help change life fact got scammed also physically disabled due arthritis rheumatoid arthritis lower back knee foot med sometimes help working help one bit either spent 10 year homeless family severely neglected age 5 lost parent early 20 sibling family aunt son treat horrible tried past 10 year get apartment based income find room rent could afford get minivan live find job could even online avail get let rejected mocked made fun etc 40 work done early 20 30 day labor cash table never real job point probably even able handle mental issue ha 10 yr since wa last hugged held anyone tell loved even mean tired alone single never loved affection watching everyone else live life dearly want live acquire matter hard try wish pulled trigger 3 night ago ended nothing left point anyone came life would probably smother affection love touch etc point would run away fast came life dying physical connection someone support come along significant know fix issue half issue single alone 4 decade trigger warning three day ago almost ended life wish end

I don't deserve to exist.,"So I was dreaming yesterday, and God came to me in a dream and talked to me about how I wasn't supposed to exist and I was a defunct anomaly in the system that wasn't supposed to exist. I was a failure and a reject that could never be accepted into heaven. Such a creature being allowed into heaven would have grave consequences on everyone living there so I had to be destined to be thrown into the lake of fire where i would burn alive for all eternity since not even God can get rid of me. He told me alot about how my parents would even suffer for giving birth to my wretched life, and how they were anomalies as well. Many of us exist in the system just to suffer and God does not give a rats ass about in any way. He told me that I cause major problems to creation itself and how I am holding humanity back from achieving true perfection as do many anomalies that exist here on planet earth right now! He said to enjoy my final days on earth because he would come and get me soon to face judgement for even being born on this earth which God did not ordain and said on the other side of the mirror I am someone horrible that shouldn't even exist! Someone similar to Satan, a being with extraordinary abilities and is also an anomaly. He said he is coming for many of us who exist here on planet earth and he also says that that consequences would be even more severe if I ever bred on this miserable planet and that people like me are the reason why this place is a piece of shit. God recommended suicide immediately to purge the earth from abominations like myself to cure planet earth of this disease as he does to many other people who suffer from suicidal thoughts.

Odd_Ad8088,It's not always to get rid of some pain,"People say that nobody kill himself to just end his life, but to stop suffering. Well... They're wrong.
That's it. I will kill myself. I'm going to do it now actually.
I'm not depressed and I don't have problems with anyone or in life. My grades at school are great, I have good relationships with my parents, I've been sleeping and eating well.

 I am atheist. I keep thinking about the vastness and the greatness of the universe, and watching videos showing how small the earth is compared to the universe makes me feel not insignificant but inside something bigger.
It makes no sense for everything to exist for no reason. Even more knowing that the universe is not infinite. How is it possible??? I know this is stupid or that this not is going to happen but I feel like if I killed myself I would have answers or wake up from the simulation.

 I live in the countryside of my country where there aren't many buildings.  I'm currently on the bus going to the big city where there are big buildings, which is how I intend to kill myself.  I don't want something painful.  I left a letter asking to be cremated to make sure my body will be totally destroyed and I won't remain conscious by accident.

I've thought of all the pros and cons, but in the end if I'm dead, not one of the cons won't matter. My family that I love is going to be torn apart, okay. But I'll be dead and I won't feel their pain.

My heart is beating fast because I'm really going to do this. 
I'm writing here with the hope that something will come up that makes me give up besides phrases I've heard that I have a lot to conquer in life.

Affectionate-Ad4039,"16 here, I am always obsessed with my suffering and how I will die someday. Because of this I thought I might as well end it early, but I am going to find the value in myself and in life and stop being afraid.","I have drilled into my mind that no matter what, I will kill myself someday. If not now at 16, maybe when im alone in my apartment at 24 or maybe after someone I love in my life dies in my 40s etc. So why should I wait? I'm already impatient enough and scared enough. I might as well just kill myself today.  And if I dont kill myself, I will probably just die from some other cause further down the line; so, whats the point of living? 

Well I decided that I dont give a flying fuck if its further down the line. All I got is the breathe I breathe and the things  I think and do with the mind I was given by the almighty today. Today is the only day I got.  So instead of existen in the future and in the past, Im gonna exist today. I dont know if im dying tomorrow so im pushen today. My mom didnt push me out so i would just push myself into the dirt. I accept that life is out control. Life is disgusting. The earth is filthy. I am filthy. Everyone is a damn sinner. But that doesnt mean I just have to sit here and take it like a hoe is smashen me wit a strapon. I have little power over my life, but damn it, Im gonna use that power for whatever good i can. Im gonna use that power for the almighty.

After I get outta this and get straight with my fam, by golly gee willickers, I am gonna help all these homeless peoples out, all these depressed peoples and suicidal peoples, all these poor peoples, all these people looking for god peoples, all these peoples that strugglen like I am peoples. I hate hedonist. People who dedicate their life to pleasure. I used to do that. It helps with the pain doesnt it? but that demon of depression and hoplessness always gon stick they finger in my asshole, but rn, that demon just got MY FINGER in they asshole. And im gon wiggle that finger until that hoe is bleeden like a mf gore video. Im gonna conqueren this bitchass demon. God (or myself idk) didnt spawn this dumb demon in my life just so i would run off scared and afraid. Life is like clocken in at yo job. I was born to do my job. and that mf job is to help all the other mf people on this filthy musty ass planet, not to pursue pleasure or some other bullshit reason. I gotta job to do until the day I die and if that day be tommorow i dont give a freak. Imma die with purpose.

Sonder:   noun. **the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own**. 

Everyone goin through this poo poo ass life. Movies and fictional stories are lies. Life is a fatboy that wants to eat you up and let the stomach acid burn you for its pleasure. BUT NAW, FUCK THAT FATBOY. IM GON KILL THAT FATBOY OF PAIN AND LIVE THE LIFE GOD DESIRES FOR ME TO LIVE.

Cheeseguy88_RS3,I don't know what too put here,"yo, so i'm about a week away from 29. and i cant shake the feeling of just exhaustion. i grew up in foster care from birth until 13. (3 failed adoptions, about 2 homes a month, was raped on more occasions than id ever admit to anyone i know, had bleach poured on me for wetting the bed etc. i'm sure this is probably most of the issue.)

at 17 after graduating from highschool i enlisted in the us army to pay four college. two combat tours later im med boarded and 5-17 after i shot a child in the head (on orders) and from there its mostly blurr.

since then I've done okay. i'm a functional member of society, i work hard to just keep my self occupied and my hands busy but the longer everything goes on i just find less and less to live for. i just  read about ny cutting funding to children and family and honestly this hurt the most. i spent most of my child hood fighting just too eat and now more children will be worse off? its just hard to watch all of this and know that everything ive ever done has only hurt more people and more like me are suffering even more.

my girlfrend of almost four years now is great but honestly even after i've told her of this feeling of just a desire to be done its like...not that its her fault but i just feel like she thinks i'm jokeing. honestly im at a loss and i finally tried to use the online chat thing and this seems to not work either for chrome or Linux

throwaway716433,Poem to vent - The First Attempt,"It has been an utter waste of effort and time. Everything has completely collapsed, yet even now, I hesitate. In the process of the one action that may bring me solace, I continue to struggle. What purpose has my life served? I fail to comprehend how this existence serves as nothing more than a futile attempt at fulfilling goals that I have never even longed for. There has never been a principle in my life as concrete as the absence of meaningful thought in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

There is nothing to rationalize. Failure is failure. It has done nothing for me but unearth a suicidal ideation rooted within me. I ruminate continuously the impetus of my existence, yet the question itself leaves me more dumbfounded than I have ever been regarding the true nature of my being. Why is it that I wish so incessantly for death? Why is it that I demand mercy even from God, rather than carrying out my “Salvation” through my own means?

&amp;#x200B;

Has my desire for nonexistence gained such a control over me that I demand it of a supreme being whose presence is less certain than my own? How pathetic of a mind I possess! Rather, I am the mind which I loathe so greatly for imbuing every waking second of my life with an unshakable misery. I am the consciousness. How can I even begin to deflect the blame? Surely, my condition is not a product of my environment. It is simply a direct result of a fundamental flaw in my being. I am what is wrong with me. There is nothing else that can be so directly attributed as the cause to my despair. It is so.

&amp;#x200B;

It is better for me to do nothing at all. Nothing can cure this disease… no, this feature of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the alternative to doing nothing is becoming nothing. At the very least, it provides the possibility of an escape. An outlet for my suffering. Though it is uncertain to me whether or not death will bring an end to these thoughts, I am so agonizingly desperate for a reprieve that I will willingly attempt to find it through irreversible means. I loathe myself, yet I am the most selfish and narcissistic excuse for a human being that has ever roamed the likes of this Earth.

RedRik9,"I am a disapointment, suicide seems the only option","For starters I was born with cerebral parlsy so started walking on my own kinda late and even so never walked normally in my life. I got bullied for being weak in school, I got beat up by my mom everyday and I thought I was hated by everyone.
My mother was loving to everyone, my youngest uncles were treated way better them us children by her. One of them, is like 5 - 6 years older then me and he decided to rape me one day, he offen offered to take care of us to be in the good side of my mom.

I was alwats labeled as slow, lazy, sloppy but inteligent even tho never had great grades.

When I was 12 I felt guilty because my mother died in an accident and my was in the hospital for months, felt guilty cause I wanted her to disappear, and I remember wanting to switch places with her.

I eventually moved to another country at 21, I couldn't finish high school cause had no money to eat, and my dad was out of the country. So it has been almost 10 years, I did very phisycal jobs even tho I shouldn't so I could be independent, my condition worsened because of this and now I can't do it anymore. I can't get education cause they tell me to get better at the language(grammarly).

I was in a ward a year ago to prevent suicide, and a friend became my best friend, called me everyday when I was there.


My dad had a stroke, so he can't do much by himself, he get's frustrated at me even tho I am trying to take care of him... My best friend knows I am struggling but she doesn't wanna talk to me, idk if it's temporary or if it's over but I am tired...

LurkeroftheShadow,Gonna kill myself this Sunday (4/03) and nobody can stop me,"Freshmen year was supposed to be the start of the best years of my life, at least that's what everyone told me, and I was stupid enough to believe it. This year has been an absolute shit-show and I don't want 3 more years of this.

At the beginning of this year a ""nice guy"" asked me out and I told him no, and he made my life hell. He stalked me online and in person, his friends called me a whore, slut, faggot and he has done the same to my best friend. He cried on livestream about how I was a terrible person who lead him on and how he wanted to kill himself because f my rejection. I got death threats and was told to kill myself several times by his friends. This is still going on, me and my friend are still getting stalked by him.

I also end up ruining good things. I always end up saying something that makes people mad, or I annoy them and they always leave. I was really close with a lot of people, but they all have grown distant. None of them talk to me outside and of and some of them barely talk to me in school, I'm not good enough to make people stay. 99% of people ignore me and when they don't ignore me they just do things to purposely make me upset and bully me, I don't fit in with anyone.

I broke my clean streak, I cut again. It doesn't hurt and I don't get pleasure from it, I don't know why I do it. I have control over it to, I can stop I just want to do it. 

I'm fucking useless, even my mom thinks this. I barely remember to do chores, and I all I do is sleep when I get home because everything is tiring. Even the things I love like reading, tech club, drawing, it's all too tiring and I just find myself going to sleep everyday once I get home. I avoid tech club because everyone always asks if I'm okay, but when I say no they walk away. I don't blame them though, I wouldn't want to have to deal with me either. 

There's a few people who care, and forgive me for saying this, but I'm too tired to care about how my death will affect them. I don't give a crap anymore. I just want it all to end, why should I care about how they'll feel? I'll be dead. Besides, in a few years they'll forget about me. I've already withdrawn from people so my death won't sting quite as bad.

I can't stop the thoughts that tell me to slash my wrists, to jump out my window, to hang myself from my closet door, to take a bunch of pills and go to bed forever, I want to rest. I want this all to stop, I don't care about what I'll miss, I don't fucking care. I just want a restart, but I can't so I'll take a game over. 14 years is enough for me

I've already made plans. I know what I'm going to give my friends after I die, I have a method and I even picked out an outfit to wear. Not going to lie, I'm getting some weird excitement from planning this. Not sure if it's exciting or just comforting or both. I'll probably won't post again before or on Sunday, so I'm guessing that this is gonna be my goodbye. Goodbye everyone, I'm sorry to those who messaged me and tried to talk me out of it, just know that if it weren't for you I would have been dead months ago.

ChasingKills,I really regret going to therapy in college.,"I used to be able to store my feelings away and be cool but now everything hurts. I've been peacefully numb since high school but now I feel everything. I want to die but I also just want the strongest antidepressant meds possible. I don't have the support group I used to have so I'm completely alone.

I'm going back and forth on this because truthfully I don't care if my death hurts anyone. I told my family about issues within the family and I've been villainized or told I should figure out how to fix it myself. On the other hand one day I'll just leave and find a support group. I don't know nor do I think that stuff will be worth living for. Having a support system was enough as a child/teen but with the responsibilities of an adult it's not really worth it. I miss when I didn't remember anything and I would just do whatever, just not feel anything. I do want to get my full siblings out of this shithole because I know this will never get better.",chasing kill used able store feeling away cool everything hurt peacefully numb since high school feel everything want die also want strongest antidepressant med possible support group used completely alone going back forth truthfully care death hurt anyone told family issue within family villainized told figure fix hand one day leave find support group know think stuff worth living support system wa enough child teen responsibility adult really worth miss remember anything would whatever feel anything want get full sibling shithole know never get better really regret going therapy college
Triangle-Buddy,No hope,"Made a post recently so won’t repeat much of it. But still feeling generally hopeless. My friend says she’ll get better but every time her health seems to get better something happens and it gets worse. I’m so fucking scared all the time to the point it’s affecting my health and my life. My blood pressure is crazy right now, and I think it’s partially due to the stress and agony of this situation. I’m terrified of her dying and I feel so helpless. Everything else in my life is shit. Work, family, fake friends, basic hoes, the fact I’m homeless again, it’s all shit. It all makes me feel so empty, sad, and bored. I was already sick of my life and wanting to die before but this shit with my friend’s health is too much. She told me she’ll be fine, we’ll see a movie, this and that but I’m afraid to even have hope at this point because every time I have hope of it getting better something happens and it gets 100x worse. I just expect my life to be getting worse and worse all the time now. If it weren’t for the fact that folk need me financially I’d just end it all. This is too much it’s so painful just to be alive. The only thing that brings me comfort anymore is the thought I’ll be dead one day and the pain will be over. Maybe once they’re done financially without me and the suicide clause on my life insurance is done I’ll finally do it. I want to so bad. Preferably in a way where it doesn’t look like suicide. Hell I’d hire someone to “murder” me. I must be being punished for something, it’s like I’m in hell just make it stop please.",triangle buddy made post recently repeat much still feeling generally hopeless friend say get better every time health seems get better something happens get worse fucking scared time point affecting health life blood pressure crazy right think partially due stress agony situation terrified dying feel helpless everything else life shit work family fake friend basic hoe fact homeless shit make feel empty sad bored wa already sick life wanting die shit friend health much told fine see movie afraid even hope point every time hope getting better something happens get 100x worse expect life getting worse worse time fact folk need financially end much painful alive thing brings comfort anymore thought dead one day pain maybe done financially without suicide clause life insurance done finally want bad preferably way look like suicide hell hire someone murder must punished something like hell make stop please hope
lukesky411,i just dont understand.,"My life has been in this vicious cycle. 
I'm 33 years old. I've has more than 17 surgeries. 
Ive had 3 heart caths. 
Every single time I build up a life, sickness primarily interrupts and it's taken away. 
Last August, I had the bad covid pneumonia. I was living at home with my mother and grandmother. I couldn't eat or sleep for 2 weeks straight. I went to the er 8 times because of the pain. I didnt get my first breathing treatment until third week of August and it was only.because my mom decided to take me to an out of town hospital. But to make a long story short, it was mid sept before I was ok again. 
I ended up having the chance to move in with my best friend 3 hours away so I did. Finally got a job making money. Everything was going fine. I got covid again in Jan 2022 but it lasted a week and felt more of the flu than anything else. Went back to work. Mid Feb comes. The weekend comes. My friend went to his family and I went to mine to visit. The first night I took 60mg of zanaflex. It helps me sleep. I woke up at 5am. I went to get my phone. But there was a wooden dresser between me and my night stand. So I stood up, walked to my bedroom.door. tried to open it. There was no door knob. It was not there. There was a wooden boards on the crease of it. I remember panicking. So I turn around and om trying to turn the light on and couldn't touch the strings bc they were constantly moving from me. Then a white pew with a red cushion comes out. I try to get over it but I couldn't. So I just sat down on it and just prayed to Jesus. I got up and suddenly I could open my bedroom.door again. I never ever experienced something so real like that. It scared me. But things got worse after that. The days ahead my blood pressure was 80/60 and heart rate was 35 to 40 bpm. For days. Every time I tried to get up and walk, i had this dizzy feeling like I was gonna pass out. One time.i did fall. Finally one Wednesday night my mom takes me to the er. They give me one bag of fluids and send me home. Things didnt get better. I lost my job as they called me that morning. Then on Sunday bp was still low so my.mom takes me to a bigger hospital. They immediately transport me to another bigger hospital. Monday I had a heart cath. No blockages. But I had sepsis. And probably still do. I was there till thursday. That was end of feb. From then until now, I've lost 40 pounds. I have had a UTI for a month. Every thing I eat tastes horrible. I can't hardly do anything without getting out of breath. I still haven't had the strength to even get my things from my friends house. I've thought about just taking a bunch of benadryl but I heard it's a bad way to die. I've taken some seroquel before but it made my heart beat really hard. Sometimes I want to just break.my.foot or something. I dont know why i feel this way. I really want to travel but I dont have money. I just dont know what to do anymore. I dont wanna work. I'm just tired. My father and grandma both died at 45 for heart issues. I wonder if I'll ever make it to 45. I feel like I'm just late. I see people way younger than me that's married and got a good job and good money and I have nothing. I feel like im.just a burden on everyone. I dont know what to do. I'm tired of struggling. I just lay in bed one day to the next. Those who I thought would be there for.me isnt there. No one cares about me. Maybe I should.give up.",luke sky 411 life ha vicious cycle 33 year old ha 17 surgery ive 3 heart caths every single time build life sickness primarily interrupt taken away last august bad covid pneumonia wa living home mother grandmother eat sleep 2 week straight went er 8 time pain didnt get first breathing treatment third week august wa mom decided take town hospital make long story short wa mid sept wa ok ended chance move best friend 3 hour away finally got job making money everything wa going fine got covid jan 2022 lasted week felt flu anything else went back work mid feb come weekend come friend went family went mine visit first night took 60mg zanaflex help sleep woke 5am went get phone wa wooden dresser night stand stood walked bedroom door tried open wa door knob wa wa wooden board crease remember panicking turn around om trying turn light touch string bc constantly moving white pew red cushion come try get sat prayed jesus got suddenly could open bedroom door never ever experienced something real like scared thing got worse day ahead blood pressure wa 80 60 heart rate wa 35 40 bpm day every time tried get walk dizzy feeling like wa gonna pas one time fall finally one wednesday night mom take er give one bag fluid send home thing didnt get better lost job called morning sunday bp wa still low mom take bigger hospital immediately transport another bigger hospital monday heart cath blockage sepsis probably still wa till thursday wa end feb lost 40 pound uti month every thing eat taste horrible hardly anything without getting breath still strength even get thing friend house thought taking bunch benadryl heard bad way die taken seroquel made heart beat really hard sometimes want break foot something dont know feel way really want travel dont money dont know anymore dont wanna work tired father grandma died 45 heart issue wonder ever make 45 feel like late see people way younger married got good job good money nothing feel like im burden everyone dont know tired struggling lay bed one day next thought would isnt one care maybe give dont understand
DramaticPapayaEater,It's weird how casual the idea of dying becomes past a certain point,"I used to be very dramatic and chaotically conflicted about it. Nowadays, it's like... Yeah, let's get to it eventually. People are just making a big deal out of the whole thing, and it's such an accepted inevitability for me that I'm pretty unphased by it.

At the end of the day, it'll be quick, it'll be easy, it'll be simple and inconsequential.

All I need is for my package to arrive. Then, on a day like today when not even food has taste, when the little things I have to hang on to keep me distracted, it'll be time.

I'm not even angry anymore. Just melancholic. Kind of disappointed. And tired.

It's not the world. It's me. And that's ok. Not everyone gets to have a spot.",dramatic papaya eater used dramatic chaotically conflicted nowadays like yeah let get eventually people making big deal whole thing accepted inevitability pretty unphased end day quick easy simple inconsequential need package arrive day like today even food ha taste little thing hang keep distracted time even angry anymore melancholic kind disappointed tired world ok everyone get spot weird casual idea dying becomes past certain point

Cerena407,Everybody uses me then is quick to drop me so why should I keep going?,"All the men that talk to me just want one thing from me. I am just an object to them. Once they get what they want then it’s like I don’t exist. I’m always just a whore. When it comes to other people in my life like my family, they’re quick to ask for money then not bother to talk to me. I took care of my brother and sister growing up. Im the oldest and I wasn’t able to cry when my dad was beating my mom because I had to stay strong for my little siblings. But my siblings are older now and they don’t care to call or visit me unless they need something. Nobody will care if I die except for my mom. But I feel like she only cares for me out of guilt. She was an addict my entire life and just recently became sober three years ago. Her and my dad put me thru hell so she feels like she has to deal with my mental health issues because it’s her fault. I’m trying to find peace in life. I’m a tattoo artist and I’m also in the army reserves so I have careers. I’m not ugly or anything so looking in I have a pretty good life. But I can’t help but hate myself and hate my life. I hate who I am and I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. People always see me as happy, loud, and carefree. But in reality it’s all a mask. I’ve recently had my breaking point. I was fired from my job because I wasn’t coming into work. I mean I can’t blame my boss I’d fire me too. But the weeks I didn’t come into work was because I was planning out my suicide. I was starting to pack my shit and writing my suicide notes. However my mom noticed and made me get help.

Jurez1313,I lied to my doctor today,"My doctor asked me some questions. One of them was ""Any active plans or recent thoughts of harming yourself?"" I said no, last time was 10 months ago. That was a lie. Last time was a &lt; month ago when I bought a rope and a stool (still in my car) and was 10 minutes away from the spot I was going to hang myself. But then I went home and didn't eat anything for 3 days. They know that part though (they being my doctor and mother - yep, 30 year old man, had to have his mom come to his doctor because he can't advocate for himself like a little bitch).  

But even if that all wasn't the case? I'm planning to do it this weekend. I can't see how this will ever get better. I'm a lazy pussy who can't even bring himself to say hi to people he wants to get to know. How will I ever get anyone to date me, let alone ever fall in love with someone? The answer is I won't, unless I can get over that fear. But I never will, because I refuse to take risks to improve my situation. Even the most minor of risk is too much to handle. So I'll stay in my room, playing video games, looking at pictures of people in relationships, daydreaming of the life I'll never have, feeling sorry for myself instead of actually doing anything to fix it. Because I'm too scared of failure to ever try.

CancelFriendly,What keeps you going?,"  I for one think of my family, friends, and girlfriend. Generally speaking, I'm probably quite fortunate compared to others. I have a supportive family and people who love me. 

  I've had in the past dealt with some emotional abuse, dealt with anxiety and depression most of my life, and trauma including walking in on someone else's successful suicide which by the way, I know it's said over and over again, the only thing stopping yourself from doing it is the burden on the ones you leave behind and its true, its painful to know and witness. Personally, I believe that suicide doesn't solve a problem, it transfers it onto the people you love most.

  What else do you all think about when you're down and waivering in you're will to live to help you pull through. I'd really like to think some people find reasons to live for their own good rather than just doing it for others. I'd like to be more that way myself and like to hear from some of you and perhaps get some inspiration.

  Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope all of you stay strong.",cancel friendly one think family friend girlfriend generally speaking probably quite fortunate compared others supportive family people love past dealt emotional abuse dealt anxiety depression life trauma including walking someone else successful suicide way know said thing stopping burden one leave behind true painful know witness personally believe suicide solve problem transfer onto people love else think waivering live help pull really like think people find reason live good rather others like way like hear perhaps get inspiration thank taking time read hope stay strong keep going

BambiSleepLove,Why do I have to be imprisoned in my situation.,I’m practically unable to escape my abusive relationship with my parents to the point where if I try to leave they’ll probably hurt me or worse probably kill me. My disability kept me from progressing through high school so now my only escape is suicide why are men and women so scary. And before you say there’s always a way out or it gets better you don’t know my situation so please don’t assume.  I’m terrified and scared of the situation I’m in. I no longer want to spectate my own life anymore. I’m 20 years old I was a god damn valedictorian and cross country athlete and now I’m forever stuck as some disabled and dependent disappointment of a child imprisoned within my own house and with my abusive parents. The funny thing is I’m writing this but I’m completely calm no racing heartbeat no nothing just faint numbness. If anyone wants my life they can take it I don’t care what you do with me.,bambi sleep love practically unable escape abusive relationship parent point try leave probably hurt worse probably kill disability kept progressing high school escape suicide men woman scary say always way get better know situation please assume terrified scared situation longer want spectate life anymore 20 year old wa god damn valedictorian cross country athlete forever stuck disabled dependent disappointment child imprisoned within house abusive parent funny thing writing completely calm racing heartbeat nothing faint numbness anyone want life take care imprisoned situation

But nop. 

The saddest part is that doing the assalt attempt I was not even scared of been killed ( I m just afraid of pain), cause I've tried suicide many times, but when I was running I've met some of my classmates , and I was worry about losing them. Of course they were afraid too and asked if I were okay, but they act like they wouldn't miss me at all. 

I am completly discartable... 
I taught I would stop considering suicide, but after that I am feeling exiceted to try again.",lonely sad wa almost killed today street morning class lunch wa going afternoon class tought least classmate would give shit almost losing nop saddest part assalt attempt wa even scared killed afraid pain cause tried suicide many time wa running met classmate wa worry losing course afraid asked okay act like miss completly discartable taught would stop considering suicide feeling exiceted try almost died today
YourConvictedConvict,I'm scared as hell..,"My name is James. I'm currently in a good position with my employment that I've been grinding at for a good half a decade and have lots of benefits. My credit is great, my assets outweigh my debt by a decent margin, and I have started a brand new thriving family.

As of 48 hours ago, everything was perfect. My pregnant wife of 8 months is healthy and doing great, I support her entirely. She moved from home to see the world with me and begin a great life of adventure. We have been married for just a year and 2 months today. She is my best friend and my sole partner. We have a rainbow child (a baby girl) on the way and I already love her just as much as my wife, if not, more. My family is so proud of me after how much I've done to build a good home.

However, just yesterday I was escorted without a clue to an office and was interrogated. Now, at first I had no idea what was going on. My supervisor who escorted me had no idea. The agents were extremely nice and polite, one stern and the other soft. This was straight out of a detective movie. Before I knew it, I had signed over rights and began talking about my experience. I was then told my charge; \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*… (Censored for privacy and explicit topics.)

Suicidal thoughts have came back after years of not having them. I got really close recently, I don't want to be alive, there's no fucking point anymore.

I have to be alive for my animals, they won't get the proper care if I'm not here. They'll be kicked into a shelter and one of them will more than likely be put down for being aggressive. If I didn't have them, I would have done it by now. That terrifies me, knowing the only thing holding me is the dogs.

Second_Wrong,I don’t like the way I look," There is no structure to this I’m just typing what I’m feeling. My main reason for wanting to kill my self is my physical appearance and the lack of confidence and self esteem and what that has done to my life. I know it seems like a dumb reason and i wanted to share this to r/ugly instead because more people would understand but it requires some things that my account doesn’t have yet. My complete lack of confidence has ruined how i live my life. I struggle making pushing myself to build up relationships or to go out and have fun. I’m depressed and I have anxiety, I think it also has to do with how I was raised because after talking to my older sister she feels the same way. When i get sad I get really low and even when I’m not sad I’m not happy. I wish I could change my face but I can’t. I just want to love myself and feel comfortable and confident in my own body. I don’t even like my smile. Again I feel shame for this being the reason I want to kill my self. Maybe some people can relate maybe others think I’m stupid. I’ve realized that I get to my lowest point when I’m alone (to the point where I wanna kill myself) but Its never enough time to fully breakdown. So I think I’m gonna kill myself during spring break I’ll be home alone for a week. I know i won’t make it. 
Sorry for being sloppy. I didn’t put all my thoughts but I think this is a good enough.",second wrong structure typing feeling main reason wanting kill self physical appearance lack confidence self esteem ha done life know seems like dumb reason wanted share r ugly instead people would understand requires thing account yet complete lack confidence ha ruined live life struggle making pushing build relationship go fun depressed anxiety think also ha wa raised talking older sister feel way get sad get really low even sad happy wish could change face want love feel comfortable confident body even like smile feel shame reason want kill self maybe people relate maybe others think stupid realized get lowest point alone point wanna kill never enough time fully breakdown think gonna kill spring break home alone week know make sorry sloppy put thought think good enough like way look
sushidog993,"I'm at the bottom of the ocean, still stuck in highschool","This is the sentence at the start of a rant that nobody will read or care about. I'm still in highschool even though I'm 21 because my mind never left 2017. I never left 2017 because that was the last time that a group of people gave enough of a shit to me to pretend to welcome me into their friend group and treat me as if I could be a normal functioning member of society. But in the words of my good ex-friend I poison everything I get to and I'm a shitty person with a shitty personality. No, they obviously didn't keep me around. I was too much of them to handle because I've been thinking of one thing since the 3rd grade. Before I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I knew I wanted to be dead. Before I knew I wanted to be dead, I knew that people didn't like me around. It's not that I wasn't charming or nice or funny or intelligent. No, I was all of those things. But I was also very weird and strange and scary. I scared the love right out of them like now I do with everyone. 

Everyone gets sad, right? But not me, I get too sad. I get sad for years: stalk and scream at people and call them names, break things, say I'm gonna kill myself, and leave the other person wondering when I'll say that it's them I want to kill.

Some people who have met me have thought that I was the coolest guy in the universe: destined for greatness, full of infinite potential with an unbreakable will. That is until I scared that feeling out of them. They're left wondering ""what the fuck did I just see happen?"". Thankfully, these people who've shared such intimacies with me all share a condition which allows them to compartmentalize the fact that they never really knew me. Then where there once was a connection, a cold towering metal wall emerges. 

I wake up to a house of bones where there is no other soul to cling to, and no one that I can pour myself into. I go through a day in a desolate but comfortable prison filled with anything I could ever possibly want but not a soul in site. Through the glowing of screens I encounter thousands of towering cold walls concealing souls that I could never attain. I try to pour myself into them, but I spill myself down the ditch into the gutter and back to the sewer where I belong.

I return to my slumber to dream of faint memories of a time once lost. Warm soothing feelings. Having my face touched and my hair stroked and holding an angels head in my arms. Holding that angel tightly trying to stop his tears from flowing. 

But nothing stops them from flowing and he pulls his hand away from mine and I feel his scorn as he shoves me away, tells me that I didn't hold him tight enough, that I was too late, that I didn't cry for him enough. 

I run out after him with my arms wide open but I'm greeted by a tower of cold, harsh, lifeless metal. The person who I used to entangle my soul with is in the arms of another.

There's no use running after them, and there's no use screaming because no one can hear underwater.

Sometimes a warmth that glows like the sun merely leads to a heart of soot and smoldering embers. And every night I return to it.

Putting lipstick on the abyss doesn't make it stop staring back at you, nothing does. That's a reality that's just a part of being alive. Whenever you think you found a way out, it's usually a sign that you're about to become victim to unspeakable tragedies the likes of which you couldn't have ever comprehended. 

This is a universe that takes vibrant youthful flame and turns it into smoldering embers. The more you struggle, the more you'll feel yourself choking on your own flames. And one day those flames will be extinguished whether by yourself or the uncaring entropic universe. 

True darkness in this universe takes the face of love.",sushi dog 993 sentence start rant nobody read care still highschool even though 21 mind never left 2017 never left 2017 wa last time group people gave enough shit pretend welcome friend group treat could normal functioning member society word good ex friend poison everything get shitty person shitty personality obviously keep around wa much handle thinking one thing since 3rd grade knew wanted grew knew wanted dead knew wanted dead knew people like around charming nice funny intelligent wa thing wa also weird strange scary scared love right like everyone everyone get sad right get sad get sad year stalk scream people call name break thing say gonna kill leave person wondering say want kill people met thought wa coolest guy universe destined greatness full infinite potential unbreakable scared feeling left wondering fuck see happen thankfully people shared intimacy share condition allows compartmentalize fact never really knew wa connection cold towering metal wall emerges wake house bone soul cling one pour go day desolate comfortable prison filled anything could ever possibly want soul site glowing screen encounter thousand towering cold wall concealing soul could never attain try pour spill ditch gutter back sewer belong return slumber dream faint memory time lost warm soothing feeling face touched hair stroked holding angel head arm holding angel tightly trying stop tear flowing nothing stop flowing pull hand away mine feel scorn shove away tell hold tight enough wa late cry enough run arm wide open greeted tower cold harsh lifeless metal person used entangle soul arm another use running use screaming one hear underwater sometimes warmth glow like sun merely lead heart soot smoldering ember every night return putting lipstick abyss make stop staring back nothing doe reality part alive whenever think found way usually sign become victim unspeakable tragedy like ever comprehended universe take vibrant youthful flame turn smoldering ember struggle feel choking flame one day flame extinguished whether uncaring entropic universe true darkness universe take face love bottom ocean still stuck highschool
BPDWithDreams,I reflect too much. (TW),"So I’m 20 years old, I have lived in the same town since I was born, never moved schools and only really moved house 3 times. I’m always talking about just up and leaving without anyone knowing or explanation literally just dropping of the map. I hate everything about my life, absolutely all of it should have been, should be and should continue to be better. I shouldn’t have to live though any of this, every single god damn breath since my first memory feels like a waste and yet I continue breathing and it pisses me off. 

Then I start thinking about why I feel like this, why was I treated that way and why do I still try and justify all the wrongs everyone did just to keep the peace. I will argue for anyone else that every life is precious and that we are all here to better the life’s of each other. But yet here I am getting nothing from it. 

As a kid I was so selfless, at 6 years old I shouldn’t have felt the need to not eat all my food on my plate so my dad believed I was full and could eat what I hadn’t. What kind of child thinks to themselves “if I tell someone no I feel mean” I would give away my last sweet just to make anyone happy. I would never ask for food or money or toys of anyone. When my elderly neighbour gave me money I’d “drop it” outside there gate so they took it back without realising it was me giving it back. 
Why was I so selfless to think “if everyone around me is happy then how I feel doesn’t matter” at such a young age. 
I got bullied for being dirty and thin and I struggled to read and write so I thought I was stupid. I would go days without saying a word to anyone. I would hurt myself on the school floor on purpose just to feel and the teachers just told me to stop being silly. 

I always took on blame for anyone just so they wouldn’t be sad and would stay up all night with friends to make them feel safe and calm. 

I’m now 20 and you know what I have left? 
Nothing. I feel nothing. I have 1 friend left who I’m pushing away. 
I’m the family outcast 
I don’t leave the house for days or weeks and if it wasn’t for therapy I wouldn’t leave for months. 
I spend every day and night in my room just trying to think of anything to get me to the next day just to go through the same nothing all over again. 
I don’t understand why, even though I did everything to make sure no one suffered I’m lay in bed at 02:44 writing this and not even crying. I feel so empty and yet I’m still alive cos I don’t want anyone to suffer. It’s so messed up. I’m just never enough I guess.

I'm really suicidal... I went to rehab for that too
But STILL THEY ( I really don't like to call them my parents) DON'T FEEL, THAT THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT I MADE UP, MY FCKED UP MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT SCRIPTED!!! 
They really think me , my psychologist, my psychiatrist are making things up ... Just to make them feel anxious... These are drama.... 

My suicidal thoughts are just my friends now, I've already decided what to do..... My plans are clear.... 
BUT.... but somewhere I still have hopes, maybe they will get to understand that I am really not well, maybe one day they will come to me, they will ask me how do I really feel rn, they will tell me that how they love me, they will tell me that I can do this... I'm not a burden to them.... And they are glad that I exist... 

I don't really expect anything from ANYFCKINGONE, 
But when it comes to them I feel, **I'm their daughter... Do they really hate me?? This can't be true, let's try one more time, last time,** 

I don't want them to pretend infront of others , I really want them to show me, that they do care for me.... 



MAYBE MY LAST STRING WILL ALSO TEAR APART.... 
Will they be sad? Will they cry for me??? Will they tell me that they DID care for me????

Jamtok_X,Dear Mom,"I’m sorry that I did not follow through on my promise to return home to you. I’ve had this inexplicable urge to die for so long now, especially even more so after my brain surgeries. And after several different therapists + antidepressants over the past many years failed to change that, I finally came to the conclusion that NOTHING probably ever could. 

You offered to cover my living costs until I could squash this urge and financially stand on my own two feet again, but who knows how long that would’ve taken, if ever at all? Thus, I didn’t want you or anyone else to potentially waste even more time, energy, and money in trying to repair the likely-irreparable waste of sentient garbage that is me. 

While my sudden absence from your life may unfortunately sadden you deeply for an indefinite amount of time, please try to at least take comfort in knowing that my mind is hopefully finally at peace. If I’m wrong though in assuming that eternal unconsciousness awaits us all on the other side, and the fairy tales of the bible somehow turn out to actually be true, see you in hell maybe, my fellow non-believer!",jam tok x sorry follow promise return home inexplicable urge die long especially even brain surgery several different therapist antidepressant past many year failed change finally came conclusion nothing probably ever could offered cover living cost could squash urge financially stand two foot know long would taken ever thus want anyone else potentially waste even time energy money trying repair likely irreparable waste sentient garbage sudden absence life may unfortunately sadden deeply indefinite amount time please try least take comfort knowing mind hopefully finally peace wrong though assuming eternal unconsciousness awaits u side fairy tale bible somehow turn actually true see hell maybe fellow non believer dear mom

throwaway4870840098,My fate was decided the minute I was born.,"I’m a trans man and I can’t live with knowing what I’ll never be. I’ll never be a cis man. I never got to be a little boy, won’t be a teenage dude for my last years, or go through a natural male puberty. I’ll have to stab myself with a needle for the rest of my life. My chest won’t be naturally flat and will have scars, unless I get keyhole or peri, and I’ll have to get surgery for a penis. 

I have to spend years and money simply for things I should have had naturally and those are for things I can affect. Estrogen has permanently mutilated my body. I will always be short and have small hands and feet. My hips will always be wide, as they are all bone and fat distribution from T will not help. My fucking skeleton is female and I can’t do anything about it. 

And then we have my family, teachers, and school. My parents would find having a trans son to be shameful and could possibly send me to conversion therapy. Not that I blame them, I’ll just be wasting their money when they already have a son who doesn’t need any of that. My teachers would be malicious and unaccepting. The boys would never consider me part of the group and the girls would be even worse. 

The bathroom situation is whole nother problem. Even the people who aren’t assholes won’t see me as a man. When people know your trans, you are a women to them. The girls treat you like “one of the gals” and the boys stop treating you like they would with other dudes. It is simply the truth.

One day, my friend told about me to the counselor because I was isolating myself. The counselor seemed clueless, didn’t give a shit, and seemed to only be doing it out of liability. She didn’t actually care, she took pity on a sad, fucked up dude. I’m not talking to her ever again.

I’m not waiting until I’m 18, I’m already fucked. My body is already beyond repair and it will get even worse. All of this because of a fuck up that happened before I was born that I didn’t have a choice in. My cousins, classmates, and almost every other man get to be male, but not me. 

People will say I’ll get thought this and transition, but you know what? Maybe I don’t want to stab myself in the leg every few weeks. Maybe I don’t want scars as reminders. Maybe I don’t want to be reminded I went through the wrong puberty. I want to be normal, and if I’m not, then nothing else is good  enough. 

If I’m dead, everyone wins. I’m out of pain, my family could make up a story about what happened to me, and everyone at school can continue like normal without a weirdo. I don’t want to do this, but I don’t have a choice. I will be dead by August 2023 if I’m being “generous”.",throwaway 4870840098 trans man live knowing never never ci man never got little boy teenage dude last year go natural male puberty stab needle rest life chest naturally flat scar unless get keyhole peri get surgery penis spend year money simply thing naturally thing affect estrogen ha permanently mutilated body always short small hand foot hip always wide bone fat distribution help fucking skeleton female anything family teacher school parent would find trans son shameful could possibly send conversion therapy blame wasting money already son need teacher would malicious unaccepting boy would never consider part group girl would even worse bathroom situation whole nother problem even people asshole see man people know trans woman girl treat like one gal boy stop treating like would dude simply truth one day friend told counselor wa isolating counselor seemed clueless give shit seemed liability actually care took pity sad fucked dude talking ever waiting 18 already fucked body already beyond repair get even worse fuck happened wa born choice cousin classmate almost every man get male people say get thought transition know maybe want stab leg every week maybe want scar reminder maybe want reminded went wrong puberty want normal nothing else good enough dead everyone win pain family could make story happened everyone school continue like normal without weirdo want choice dead august 2023 generous fate wa decided minute wa born

Understand-Nothing,things don't get better. they only get worse. and worse. and worse.,"The first time I wanted to kill myself I was 15 years old. Rough life. I tried. It didn't work. Roughly 5 years later was when the severe depression began. Again, bad life, some things just don't get better for some people. Since that began, life is only gotten progressively worse. It's been over a decade. Things don't always get better. Every day is a struggle to justify to myself why I haven't checked out. Shame is the only thing. And to be honest, that's not the huge deterrent it was years ago. I have nothing left, not even my pride. When I tell you I wish I were dead, that is not some over-dramatic statement on behalf of a teenager who's feeling upset. Not that a teenager wouldn't know the depths of depression, I'm just saying, as you get older, you realize how deep that depression goes and that there is a very high probability that things will only get worse in life for some people. And once you've experienced them getting worse, and you no longer have that sliver of hope after 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 years to hang on to, that depression is bottomless. It just needs to be over.",understand nothing first time wanted kill wa 15 year old rough life tried work roughly 5 year later wa severe depression began bad life thing get better people since began life gotten progressively worse decade thing always get better every day struggle justify checked shame thing honest huge deterrent wa year ago nothing left even pride tell wish dead dramatic statement behalf teenager feeling upset teenager know depth depression saying get older realize deep depression go high probability thing get worse life people experienced getting worse longer sliver hope 5 10 15 20 year hang depression bottomless need thing get better get worse worse worse
Kupcakestoto,I don't think I will make it to the end of this year,"I'm 19, female and a university student and have been dealing with some undiagnosed mental illnesses for a while, probably since I was 10. I experienced some trauma when I was young. I don't want to elaborate, but sometimes the memory of it creeps in and I feel like killing myself. Every time the feelings and the thoughts of it come back, I punch myself in the head and have a panic attack. I have always been depressed, I believe that that's what this empty feeling is, since I was so young. I never really valued my life the way others do, and sometimes it baffles me when people around me talk about how excited they are about waking up tomorrow or about aging and what not. I can't relate nor do I understand it. I have server self hatred which has been with me for a while. I remember that I drank a bottle of nail polish remover when I was 12 cause I though it would kill me, it didn't, and that disappointed me. I did that because I got a bad report card and couldn't deal with my dad's disappointment so I thought dying was better. I guess my lack of care for my own life at such a young age should have been enough to convince me to tell someone about it, but I didn't. Now its much worse and there is nothing I can do about it. I have dealt with anxiety and starving myself too through out school. 

I started university last year. I somehow made it here and I'm currently studying medicine. I hate what I'm doing. I can't cope with the stress, so I have started cutting my thighs, and for some sick reason, the scars and the blood are pretty to me. Sometime, I intentionally trigger myself by checking twitter for posts of people hurting themselves just so I can feel bad about myself for not making my cuts deeper. I don't know how to stop, but it takes away the thoughts. 

 I have tried to choke myself multiple times by wrapping something really tightly around my neck and hoping I pass out so I can die slowly from lack of air. But I keep waking up disappointed. I'm starting to scare myself, if I'm being honest, with how my thoughts towards myself are becoming very violent. I just want to die, like, I can't even imagine myself 5 years in the future. I see no future for myself. I don't desire friends, or other people in my life, or stability. I hate myself and my younger self more than I can even begin to express. So I have decided that this year will be my last. I'm really tired, so I want to rest. I guess a part of me feels bad for not telling my mum, cause she would be crushed if she knew the extent of how bad things have gotten, so I guess talking about it here is a last ditch effort. I'm really sorry for being selfish. I'm really sorry for not trying hard enough. I'll try as hard as I can this year, but the time between July and September is really hard for me cause of trauma and I barely clang on last year, so I might die at that time this year. I'm going to fail and I can't do anything about it but feel fucking sorry for myself. I hate myself.

superlua,I feel like my life is over,"23F. Never been in a seriously relationship, don't have any friends, never held down a job, healthcare-related major required classes that took place in a hospital and because of covid I've been around 2yrs without moving forward (I'm not in the us/europe). Now that classes were supposed to start, there was a bug in the website and it's like I never signed up. The school couldn't or didn't do anything for me and I have no proof about me signing up but my word. So that would push back a graduation for six months, combined with the two years of covid, and a year I had to stay away due to severe depression. I know it sounds dramatic but it's more than just six months of wait for me. I really thought things were finally falling to place again but it was just failure after countless other failures. Everyone around me is graduating or doing something with their lives. Maybe a job, or getting married. I was a high achiever and now I'm a failure. I can't look at myself in the mirror because I'm so embarrassed. And I'm so fucking lonely. Yesterday I had to pet my own hair until I slept because I'm so touch starved it hurts. I live with my parents.They don't say it but I know they're tired of me and my shit. Sometimes they'll say some backhanded things like, ""as parents we at least expect our children to have some direction, it doesn't matter what it is, just that they have something"", and these days my mother said ""x has a degree, y is married, what about you? You have nothing"" and she's right. I have nothing. It feels like I've been living on borrowed time and I should've killed myself years ago like I intended to. I don't see myself living a decent life and I'm tired of doing my best in everything only to come out empty handed. I'm tired. I think it's time to rest.",super lua 23f never seriously relationship friend never held job healthcare related major required class took place hospital covid around 2yrs without moving forward u europe class supposed start wa bug website like never signed school anything proof signing word would push back graduation six month combined two year covid year stay away due severe depression know sound dramatic six month wait really thought thing finally falling place wa failure countless failure everyone around graduating something life maybe job getting married wa high achiever failure look mirror embarrassed fucking lonely yesterday pet hair slept touch starved hurt live parent say know tired shit sometimes say backhanded thing like parent least expect child direction matter something day mother said x ha degree married nothing right nothing feel like living borrowed time killed year ago like intended see living decent life tired best everything come empty handed tired think time rest feel like life

shiranaiy,being trans feels like a curse,"So I'll top it off and say I'm privileged, despite coming from a poor country. Family is old money. Have top tier education and a decent job. Attractive, also. All of these things would have been great had I been born a cis male, and I thought I was for many years until my egg finally cracked. 

Every bit of dysphoria I feel has gotten so much worse. From a lone thought every few weeks it gnaws at me practically every waking moment. It could be a part of my body I don't like, or even worse, just ruminating about how shitty the world is for us. 

I'm privileged in that my long term girlfriend has accepted me for who I am and still loves me despite being straight (I guess she's flexible in that regard) and supports me unconditionally. My parents are tolerant and will support me as long as I don't go on HRT before giving them a grandchild. 

But damn if it still doesn't suck. I hate being closeted at work, even though my workplace is probably LGBT-friendly, just out of fear of anything that might happen. Of not passing. And I never will be able to go stealth because my country doesn't allow legal name or gender changes for any reason. 

I hate knowing that to most of the world I will always be some freakshow monster. I'm seeing the news about the trans wonan who raped another woman in a hospital ward in the UK. That's what people will think of when they think of me. Being just another psychotic man in a dress. Even those who do accept me, my friends and family, will take what I say at face value but will always believe in the bottom of their hearts that I'm a crazy man with a mental disorder making him delusional. ""Poor shiranaiy he's so confused. God bless him."" One false rape or SA accusation is all it'll take to turn the world against me and I'd sooner see myself 6 feet underground than inside a men's prison for any significant duration. 

My girlfriend is the only person I really feel like has my side and even then I'm afraid to lean on her too much. I fear she'll be tired of my shit since I break down practically every night from dysphoria and she has her own burdens to carry. She's practically my lifeline at the moment and if anything happened to our relationship I most likely will never find love again out of being lesbian AND trans, so Idon't see much reason not to join the 41%. 

My mental health is hanging by a thread and good therapists here are just so in demand that I need to wait more than a month in between sessions. And even then knowing that HRT is several years away because I can't afford to support a child yet is supposed to give me hope - my mother tells me to be strong knowing there's a light at the end of all of this. I feel like shit for not being able to tough it out and feeling terrible when I have any doubts about passing.

I don't know what to do. I'm socially transitioning littlr by little but hate myself for not passing and not being able to do anything about it. I half consider just jumping off the  roof already.",shi rana iy top say privileged despite coming poor country family old money top tier education decent job attractive also thing would great born ci male thought wa many year egg finally cracked every bit dysphoria feel ha gotten much worse lone thought every week gnaws practically every waking moment could part body like even worse ruminating shitty world u privileged long term girlfriend ha accepted still love despite straight guess flexible regard support unconditionally parent tolerant support long go hrt giving grandchild damn still suck hate closeted work even though workplace probably lgbt friendly fear anything might happen passing never able go stealth country allow legal name gender change reason hate knowing world always freakshow monster seeing news trans wonan raped another woman hospital ward uk people think think another psychotic man dress even accept friend family take say face value always believe bottom heart crazy man mental disorder making delusional poor shiranaiy confused god bless one false rape sa accusation take turn world sooner see 6 foot underground inside men prison significant duration girlfriend person really feel like ha side even afraid lean much fear tired shit since break practically every night dysphoria ha burden carry practically lifeline moment anything happened relationship likely never find love lesbian trans idon see much reason join 41 mental health hanging thread good therapist demand need wait month session even knowing hrt several year away afford support child yet supposed give hope mother tell strong knowing light end feel like shit able tough feeling terrible doubt passing know socially transitioning littlr little hate passing able anything half consider jumping roof already trans feel like curse

i hit it off with one person, but i guess i'm just not into the social scene enough for her. she's fairly popular, loves to gossip. i don't. she also thinks my taste in music is lame or something. i lost another friend because she ended up thinking i was weird (which was hard, because although she wasn't big into the stuff i'm into, we had a few things in common and she was teaching me to play baseball, so we had more in common lol). i know you don't need to be exactly like your friends to be friends with them, and i'm open to being friends with anyone, just seems like the kids i've met don't think the same way. i don't judge, i accept everyone. i try my best to be a good person all the time. and just get laughed at.

i just can't seem to understand why i have so few friends, aside from what i listed. it gets me down (like i am right now), thinking i'm worthless, stupid, weird, etc. i know i'm not really attractive/pretty, which again, i never judge a persons worth on their looks, but SO many people do. it's shitty and it sucks. i also am starting to feel like i'm too childish (which, idk, i'm just trying to have fun in my life.)

reyyyyybeepboop,I just want someone to listen to me,"I’m planning on doing it later today (around afternoon at my time) and I just wanted someone to hear the reasons why I wanted to go.

Currently, I’m (F15) in one of the top classes in school. Even though the government in my country claims to have taken out the ranking system in all schools, almost all the teachers still use it. They all claim that since we are in the top class, we should be better than those in other classes. It’s been barely 4 months and I can’t handle the pressure.

The worst teacher is my math teacher. It is compulsory for us to take double maths (elementary math and advanced math) and she teaches us for both maths. She gives enormous amounts of homework everyday that I just can’t handle. I end up sick a lot of the time cause I do her homework late into the night and go to school without sleeping much. 

I’ve begun to lose motivation to do my work since last week I think. And I wanna die because I’m scared of the consequences that may come with not doing my work. I’ve talked to my mom about this, telling her that I can’t handle the stress in being in the top class. All she ever tells me is “that’s how life is”. If that’s how life truly is then I rather go now then suffer more.

Thank you for taking your time to read it.

asxtrobrian,chronic illness,"17,F

I’m doing my best to not t*ke my life but I have 4 chronic illnesses and I can’t sleep or eat peacefully anymore.  I’ve done all the medications I’ve been prescribed (it took 3 years for a diagnosis and to be taken seriously) but either none of them help or eventually the help wears off. I got some relief for periods of time in the last year or so but now I find it incredibly difficult to sleep and eat due to the constant pain everywhere, dry heaving and nightmares IF I do sleep.  I mostly take naps during the day but it feels like my body is on fire and i deal with chronic fatigue so not being able to sleep but being exhausted and fatigued constantly is an uphill battle. 

I remember feeling incredibly hopeless in summer 2020 and things have only gotten worse since then. I developed severe OCD (not relating to health surprisingly) that made me extremely su*cidal and sent me to the hospital last year and got diagnosed with diabetes a month ago. Things are piling up and I have to finish my school year (I don’t know how I will with the adhd, depression and constant illness) but I truly don’t see anything getting better for me.

I haven’t slept well in 2 weeks. Every single night is pain, severe nausea, medicine medicine medicine, dry heaving, crying, restless leg syndrome (as if I didn’t need more things to deal with at night time) and it makes me want to rip my body off me and just be a soul or something. Maybe then I could enjoy the simplest things and have a will to live.

I don’t wanna keep living, and the only reason I do is because of my family. My dad passed away 6 years ago and my mom was left to take care of me and my brother by herself, and I know me being sick isn’t helpful. (To be clear I’m not suicidal mainly because I feel like a burden, I’m just so sick of being sick and I can’t get help as much as I try)

My family is trying their best. My mom is so fucking strong and I don’t know how she does it. I don’t want to leave them, but I’m indescribably, fucking tired. This isn’t something that will ever get cured. They’re all chronic illnesses that I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life, and the only thing that’s promised to me is that I’ll have more horrible, horrible days ahead of me. Maybe I’ll find a medication that helps me, but I’d appreciate it if no one told me this. I’m so tired of false hope. I’ve tried more medications, lifestyle changes, prayers, doctors and surgeries than I can count and nothing helps. The only thing I have are my diagnoses. 

I know this would break my family. I just know. I know my mom, and while she’s the strongest person I’ve ever met, I know losing her CHILD would destroy her, so that’s why I stay. 

But I’m breaking apart here and I don’t know how much left of me there’ll be if I don’t get relief soon. I don’t go outside because I’m immunocompromised, and even if I tried to I’m ALWAYS sick, with pain or something else so I wouldn’t be able to enjoy my time regardless.  I can’t eat without immediately regretting it in pain and severe nausea, and I can’t sleep without hitting myself (for relief) crying my heart out, nearly vomiting, and trying as many meds as I can without ODing, only to be met with nightmares if I manage to fall asleep. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I rant often (and I don’t blame myself for it tbh) but I know that can be annoying to others. 

My whole point of this wasn’t to look for hope? I don’t think.

Maybe I wanna talk to someone, or maybe I just want someone to tell me SOMETHING that could actually make me feel better. Not false hope.

The only things I can think of that would make me feel freedom right now, would be that all my illnesses could and would be cured instantly, or that my family doesn’t need and that me dying wouldn’t destroy them. 

Neither of those things are possible.

I’m so fucking tired and I just wanna be healthy again.",x tro brian 17 f best ke life 4 chronic illness sleep eat peacefully anymore done medication prescribed took 3 year diagnosis taken seriously either none help eventually help wear got relief period time last year find incredibly difficult sleep eat due constant pain everywhere dry heaving nightmare sleep mostly take nap day feel like body fire deal chronic fatigue able sleep exhausted fatigued constantly uphill battle remember feeling incredibly hopeless summer 2020 thing gotten worse since developed severe ocd relating health surprisingly made extremely su cidal sent hospital last year got diagnosed diabetes month ago thing piling finish school year know adhd depression constant illness truly see anything getting better slept well 2 week every single night pain severe nausea medicine medicine medicine dry heaving cry restless leg syndrome need thing deal night time make want rip body soul something maybe could enjoy simplest thing live wanna keep living reason family dad passed away 6 year ago mom wa left take care brother know sick helpful clear suicidal mainly feel like burden sick sick get help much try family trying best mom fucking strong know doe want leave indescribably fucking tired something ever get cured chronic illness deal rest life thing promised horrible horrible day ahead maybe find medication help appreciate one told tired false hope tried medication lifestyle change prayer doctor surgery count nothing help thing diagnosis know would break family know know mom strongest person ever met know losing child would destroy stay breaking apart know much left get relief soon go outside immunocompromised even tried always sick pain something else able enjoy time regardless eat without immediately regretting pain severe nausea sleep without hitting relief cry heart nearly vomiting trying many med without oding met nightmare manage fall asleep sorry long post rant often blame tbh know annoying others whole point look hope think maybe wanna talk someone maybe want someone tell something could actually make feel better false hope thing think would make feel freedom right would illness could would cured instantly family need dying destroy neither thing possible fucking tired wanna healthy chronic illness

No_Rooster_5489,Death is a comforting thought and that’s why I’m so scared.,"No matter what we fear, whether if it is heights, needles, or escalators, fear has one thing at its core; humans are naturally afraid to die. The reason we feel pain and fear to begin with is because it is human nature to survive. However, if a person were to fall into a hole where it seems impossible to escape, somehow it’s comforting to know that death is an exit that will always be there. And that’s why I’m so damn scared. 

Maybe it’s my instincts reacting, telling me to survive no matter the cost. But I’ve been in this hole for far too long. I’ve tried over and over again to climb my way out, only to find myself falling and getting more hurt over and over again.

And there it is. Like a neon sign alluring my attention, there is an exit sign called death. Wouldn’t it be so easy to leave all this? And as often as I find myself grasping at death’s doorknob, I can’t seem to get myself to go through. Because every so often, daylight sneaks its way into my deep and otherwise dark hole. And as faint as it is, it somehow warms me inside. And I find my self staying here for another day, hoping that one day that daylight will outshine the exit sign that reads “death”.",rooster 5489 matter fear whether height needle escalator fear ha one thing core human naturally afraid die reason feel pain fear begin human nature survive however person fall hole seems impossible escape somehow comforting know death exit always damn scared maybe instinct reacting telling survive matter cost hole far long tried climb way find falling getting hurt like neon sign alluring attention exit sign called death easy leave often find grasping death doorknob seem get go every often daylight sneak way deep otherwise dark hole faint somehow warms inside find self staying another day hoping one day daylight outshine exit sign read death death comforting thought scared

NovelVisual4708,I'm a guy that just turned 18 years old and life is misarable,"My problems started when I was 14 or 15, I've noticed that people around me didn't like me that much, I wasn't able to make friends and even if I found someone that had fun staying with me, I couldn't keep it going and they would just move on and forget about me so I started to stay more and more in the house and it got to a point where I wasn't going to school anymore. I was literally skipping weeks then it turned to months and then I just quit at 16. I tried to start going to school again, at 17 but it didn't work out, my classmates where so rude to me always making fun of the things I couldn't do and after that I don't plan on finishing high school.
Everyday my life was miserable, I would wake up every day at a different time because I was not able to keep a good sleeping habit then I would play all day on my laptop. Finally when all the people of the house were out id drink whatever I would find vodka, wine, gin till I get drunk occasionally vomiting on the ground and cleaning it while still being drunk witch it was hard. Then after that I would eat and go back to playing and then sleep at like 4 am or 5 other times even at 8.
Then I tried suicide, I tried with various methods by cutting my throat, didn't work, by stabbing myself in the chest, was too much of a pussy to do it, take lots of Xanax pills, awful drug hate it, then I took lots of sleeping pills and had a panic attack texted my teacher, told her everything that was going on she helped a bit and the next day the school finally tolds my mother to take me to the hospital (because I told her that I wanted to die but she took weeks searching for a therapist and nothing). There they take me to pysch ward, some weeks pass met some nice people that were my age and then I get out, everything seemed alright i still had that big feeling of wanting to die and every day I truly belived that the   day I'll be happy is the day that I'll die but I kept silent to this day because my mom as my family dosent belive in things such ""depression"".
In that time I also get a girlfriend she was from the psych ward as well and we are still together to this day and in 10 days we are making 1 year witch is fantastic but I don't know how to explain it but my depression is coming back harder than before. I can't cry anymore a girl at my gf school died because of suicide and the only thing that popped in my head was ""wow I'm jealous of her wish that would've been me"" I wanna cut myself more and more it's like a voice in my head is telling me ""do it"" every single day.

Effective-Bunch2149,Please some advice,"What do I do? My girlfriend treated me badly because I tried to control her use of alcohol, cigarettes and drugs.

In an insta live video I found out that same day she had cut herself and had taken 10 clonazepam and a lot of alchol, that day she wanted to kill herself, for that she cut herself, drank, and did drugs. In a call she begged him not to leave her, which he wouldn't do because I love her too much, to which I told her I would support and love her, she didn't listen to me and kept cutting herself in call, I couldn't take that anymore and told her mom, I saved her life by doing that as she had overdosed and could have bled out too. She is going to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital and was diagnosed with borderline mental disorder, bipolar and depression. She told me that she didn't remember telling me all that and I haven't had the chance to talk to her since they control her communication, I don't know what to do anymore.

sealthemeowmere,I give up.,"Yeah I'm still here, I'm not brave enough to end this. I just refuse to live anymore, now I'm just sleeping all day, sometimes crying, sometimes breaking stuff in my room in anger. And I don't eat, I just don't want to. Waiting to die.

My girlfriend, my fiance, dumped me two years ago. She cheated on me, regullary, right in my apartments, when i was at work, trying to earn money for us, thinking about gifts that i will buy for her at the payday. 

I've worked on this problem, like, really worked every day, I almost cured, never gave up, i am always positive you could never say that i am on the edge, keep chatted with everyone, approached other girls IRL with no problem, i was successful with them. Successful only to the point of a first date it never got further. There were a lot of them, no joke, 800+. Once i had a period when i was meeting up to 5 girls for a 3 months everyday, but nobody stayed with me longer. I've tried different methods with every, i was sincere, i was a liar, i was rude, badass, kind or caring, i've tried to build a sirious relationships or just a hookup. I read a lot of literature, about girls, about mindset, i am stoic btw (i was, i guess, after this letter). I've tried forget about girls comletely for a few months, but i am lonely, i have no friends, i tried tp solve this problem, but it was even more difficult than with girls. 

And I finally met someone who was willing to met with me more than once, she was perfect match in our life goals she had the same views as me, she was pretty. We've chatted a lot, I was organized the dates, planned everything, she liked that a lot, that even turned her on. And i also liked that, to finally be a man, to solve problems, to be needed by someone. That lasted for two months. And one day i called her and she stated that ""She will rather read a book than met with me"". 
Okay, another loss, that was painful, but I'm used to be hated by evetyone, i dealt with it. Kept working on myself,  I was at gym daily, i liked it, i studied my profession daily, i liked it. But then, i burned out. I lost the point to do this. I know that life won't get better, it can't get only worse, I can't achieve my goals, they're impossible, especially with this world crisis. 

And also one thing happened. I accidentally stumbled upon my ex's social media, for the first time i've checked her pictures. Big mistake, huge. I promised myself to NEVER do this, but i did, for the first time in two years...

She was much more better, in terms of looks, and mood. She improved a lot, new style, new view to life etc... And everything is my favourite, i've teached her all of this, she liked it. Once i even painted her with cosmetics by myself, it was the most intimate and romatic thing that we've done, she was so happy then, with me. Now she's gorgeous with him, she coloured her hair, she did beautiful, big and sexy tatoo, wears high hills which i like, she is stylish now. She got a pet owl, she really likes them, and i do. I planned to gift her on of them while she was with her current bf in my apartments... Now she has everything that i was planning to give her, and ""thanks to him""... There is a lot more but i will not describe everything, that will take forever. That hit me hard.

This is so unfair, she did nothing to be happy, she was never alone, she was never broken, not a second, she had him already when i was her bf. And i was left with nothing, comletely broken, but didn't gave up for so long, kept working every day, never stopped. And received nothing. My life only gets worse.

Thebazilla,Why life isn't worth it,"1. I have autism so it takes me much longer to learn social skills. I keep disrespecting people without realizing it. I try to find tips for social skills but it's always ""for kids"" and basics I already know.
Nobody believes that I've been working very hard on changing. My mom says she raised a rude daughter, I was recently banned from dance practices for saying something I didn't realize was hurtful and I was expected to just figure it out on my own.

2. In my university the only accommodations they give is extra time on exams, but I need more than that. There's a huge assignment and I've asked for help from both the prof and group members and they never respond.

3. When bad things happen to me, I never get any sympathy or empathy, its always advice (When I'm sad isn't the time) which is really just complaining about me in disguise. I've gotten into cutting because that's the only way I can get people to take my problems seriously

4. My former friend is treating me like absolute trash 

5. I have insomnia at night, a tendency to wake up in the middle of the night, and I'm always woken up early by my dad in the kitchen. So I always start my day feeling like absolute crap.

I'm just a waste of oxygen. All I do is cause problems in people's lives when I'm really trying the best I can.

RichardCIock,There is no way I make it to 30,"I am 23.  A virgin (unless getting sexually abused by your dad as a child counts) who has never even been on a date.  This will not change because I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, no one to talk to, and no means of meeting people.  I don't find going out fun, but then again I find nothing fun anymore.  I'm not going to find anyone sitting in my house but I also don't have the confidence or motivation to even bother trying anymore.  I barely eat because I hate my body.  Ive tried improving it but nothing has changed for years now. I have dreams about a girl that I always felt I'd end up with, but doesn't give a shit about me anymore, at least a couple times a week.  I can't even find peace when I'm asleep.  I'm unemployed but likely won't be soon.  Makes me feel like less of a loser but I still can't wrap my head around working for the next forty years.  My parents don't love each other and probably never have.  I'm never going to my dad about any of my problems because of what he did to me as a kid, and when I tried opening up to my mom, she told me to grow a pair.  I love music but it's not even fun anymore because everything I do I hate.  Used to love singing and thought I was good at it, but my vocal coach basically told me everything I'm doing is wrong and I'll have to relearn from scratch.  Honestly, that's what's probably bothering me the most at this point.  The only thing I ever enjoyed doing and thought I was good at, I'm not.  And it's not like practicing the guitar.  I have no idea what's right or wrong and I can't figure it out to save my fucking life.  I seem to be good at one thing - wasting my time.  I've been suicidal for about six years now, but never had impulses like this.  I was more depressed six years ago then I am now, but I never thought I could muster the balls to shoot myself if given the opportunity.  I really feel like I might if I had the option nowadays.

ItzFuzziYo,"This is it, I can't do this anymore.","I just can't take it anymore. I'm 26, and can't tell you a single time in my life where things have gone well. 

I was sexually abused as a kid, locked in my room with my own piss and shit. Never had a mother who was truly there for me, she was just a kid her self. Dad didn't want a single fucking thing to do with me, but was there for my 3 younger siblings. 

My adult life hasn't been any better. I can't hold friendships / relationships and just implode on myself every 6 months / year. It's exhausting. 

I'm tired of waking up and within 5 minutes wanting the day to be over. I'm over people telling me it gets better. What exactly gets better? Because everything is just perpetually shit. 

I was supposed to be moving back across the country to be closer to my family after moving away when I was 20 (26 now for reference) and I just can't. I can't imagine looking my mum in the eye one last time. I can't bare the thought of having to tell my dad why I don't have a career whilst my 20 year sister surpasses me in every aspect of life, although insure he'll have that same smug fucking smile while he does. 

I've got no money. Food and drug addictions that I adopted just to get through the days no longer cut it. I'm just always struggling and fed up of screaming into the fucking void. 

Doubt anyone's actually read this, but needed to write something one last time.

IdunnoThrowawayNr14,"I can't fuck this up, not again","Obligatory throwaway account warning, sorry if I don't respond or take long time to respond.

I don't honestly know where to start with this. Posting here has been in my mind for a couple months now, and still haven't come up with a snappy title or intro. Anyway, let's start in the most boring way possible (I'm sorry for those who actually will try to read this) with background information. As of writing this I'm 19 and will turn 20 later on this year, male, student, your average Joe; I'm not obese, 6ft, normal looking as far as i know/think.

I honestly don't know how i ended up in this situation. At every single step in my education (European public school) I've shot myself in the knee. I always chose something i never wanted to actually do and i regret it everyday.  
As far as i know I've felt like this to some degree since i was around 13-14 and i don't remember what triggered it or if puberty pulled a sick joke on me. My only friend of four years that i still have knows somewhat the situation of me being depressed and want to commit suicide, but I've always held back on some information and just given him the minimum just because for the years I've known him he's the type of guy that always have put others before himself, he's a person i aspire to be, someone i cannot be no matter how hard i try. He always say every time i mention it that he will support me through this and he says that he will be there if i need him, and that i should try to get professional help. I mean he's not wrong.  
I don't really know why i still haven't even i should. I'm not scared of getting therapy or getting medicated. I guess I'm scared of who will come out post therapy/medication. Will I still be me?

I've already tried to kill myself once before; overdosing pills really sucks, especially if you're a dumb motherfucker that don't get help afterwards and just lie there, alone, in pain, not getting help from anyone, laying there enjoying the silence. Well i survived that attempt and now I'm soon to try again, as I've learned my lesson and will not try to overdose again.  
This time it will be hanging myself. I first said when I was younger that ""Fuck it, let's try for 20 and if life still sucks I will kill myself"" and life hasn't gotten better so here I am. The date where I've planned this to go down is at the start of summer break.  
My parents who i somewhat despise don't know anything have started to remind me that I will need to get a job when summer starts and every time they say it I can't deny that I think that they don't need to worry anymore soon. That it all will be okay, and I got a plan. I won't be useless, mentally challenged or stupid anymore, not for long. My parents aren't really the nicest. They're fakes, they put on a mask when around other people and act like all is well and fine. When there's no one around they verbally and physically abuse you. Nowadays it's more verbal, the physical abuse stopped when I was around 10.

I don't know if this is a confession or will be acting as a substitute for a suicide letter. I'm not that great at writing, especially when my English is not my native language. But I've always wanted to be a writer of some sort, but realizing that i am hot garbage when it comes to typing, grammar, adverb etc I gave up on it. I guess it's because I grew up reading due to me not having a lot of friends and getting bullied constantly through age 6-14. At some point I got serious anger issues and whenever they teased me and it turned physical I could end up banging one of the kids face in the ground repeatedly, and if teachers didn't intervene I probably would've tried to curb stomp him or something. I don't want it to sound like a cringe fanfiction or something so I'll add that I took my fair share of beatings, but I also dealt a fair share of beatings too. The anger issues never really disappeared, but i manage to keep them under control for the most part still to this day. 

I don't know how I feel, I can't explain it. All I know is that I don't want help, I want to die. I deserve to die. It is my time to give penance. I have no other alternative left, I can't go on living, there's no potential future left. I'm a failure in the large biological race. I'm both looking forward and dreading the day, but in the end I have to do it. I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

I can't fuck this up. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. FOR ONCE DON'T FUCK IT UP AS YOU ALWAYS DO.

I feel like I need to do this, if I don't everything will just get worse. I'm slowly loosing my mind and feel more detached to reality and progressively feel like things aren't real. I feel like I'm slowly going insane, and it hurts. I probably could elaborate for eternity if given the time but I think I've gotten my thoughts across. 

There's a lot more that's I'm probably forgetting to mention,but for those who actually took their time to actually read what I had to say, thank you for reading this shitty confession for the world to see.",dunno throwaway nr 14 obligatory throwaway account warning sorry respond take long time respond honestly know start posting ha mind couple month still come snappy title intro anyway let start boring way possible sorry actually try read background information writing 19 turn 20 later year male student average joe obese 6ft normal looking far know think honestly know ended situation every single step education european public school shot knee always chose something never wanted actually regret everyday far know felt like degree since wa around 13 14 remember triggered puberty pulled sick joke friend four year still know somewhat situation depressed want commit suicide always held back information given minimum year known type guy always put others person aspire someone cannot matter hard try always say every time mention support say need try get professional help mean wrong really know still even scared getting therapy getting medicated guess scared come post therapy medication still already tried kill overdosing pill really suck especially dumb motherfucker get help afterwards lie alone pain getting help anyone laying enjoying silence well survived attempt soon try learned lesson try overdose time hanging first said wa younger fuck let try 20 life still suck kill life gotten better date planned go start summer break parent somewhat despise know anything started remind need get job summer start every time say deny think need worry anymore soon okay got plan useless mentally challenged stupid anymore long parent really nicest fake put mask around people act like well fine one around verbally physically abuse nowadays verbal physical abuse stopped wa around 10 know confession acting substitute suicide letter great writing especially english native language always wanted writer sort realizing hot garbage come typing grammar adverb etc gave guess grew reading due lot friend getting bullied constantly age 6 14 point got serious anger issue whenever teased turned physical could end banging one kid face ground repeatedly teacher intervene probably would tried curb stomp something want sound like cringe fanfiction something add took fair share beating also dealt fair share beating anger issue never really disappeared manage keep control part still day know feel explain know want help want die deserve die time give penance alternative left go living potential future left failure large biological race looking forward dreading day end got choice fuck fuck always feel like need everything get worse slowly loosing mind feel detached reality progressively feel like thing real feel like slowly going insane hurt probably could elaborate eternity given time think gotten thought across lot probably forgetting mention actually took time actually read say thank reading shitty confession world see fuck

I have been away from home for 5 years travelling and now I am stuck here with a shitty car I overpayed for and no money left. The amount of bureaucracy here literally is killing me.

She also was annoyed bc i forgot to make nuggets for my brother, my depression and anxiety gave me a lot of amnesia. 
She always tell me that she's tired of telling me when I should eat, sleep and wake up. I struggle to sleep, and that's why I can't wake up immediately. And she told me that my feet problem doesn't prevent me from that, and that she also have pain (today she just have menstrual pain,but she can walk. I literally can't and I will have flat feet all of my life)

janee-lane,Please give me some reasons to live,"For the last two weeks I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts. Bad, bad suicidal thoughts. I've hardly been eating and all I can think about is how I don't deserve to be here. I've been texting suicide helplines and it takes ages to get through and when I do they regurgitate the same stuff about how brave I am to contact them without offering any actual advice. Spring is apparently a peak time for people to kill themselves so they are probably overwhelmed with messages. It made me feel worse; their vague responses, but also guilt that they didn't help. The only thing that I find helps is sleeping too much because it makes the thoughts stop, but I can't really do that on the days I'm working. 

I just don't feel like I deserve to live anymore. I don't enjoy anything and I'm always distracted. I know it would break my family and my friends but I just want to press the stop button. I'm eaten up by memories of the person I used to be and I can't stop thinking about how I wish I'd done things differently. It's my own fault I'm so fucked up. I've been getting sad when I see old people in the street or families with children because I know that will never be me. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, at all. I've lost loads of weight in these two weeks and it feels like my body is leaving me, I've been getting strange headaches and pains I'm unused to. 

What are some real reasons to live? Genuine reasons? I don't know what I'm looking for but I just need something to change because I genuinely might do it and it's scaring me, it scares me so much. I don't go out and see anyone anymore because I'm incapable and also I don't want to meet people for drinks because if I'm drunk it might push me over the edge. Maybe that's what needs to happen though. 

I'm just lost and I'm in this endless loop of regret. I just don't feel like this life is for me. Everyone has their connections and their habits and I don't have anything, it's took me months to realise that but I just don't. Sorry for the essay. Someone please say something kind.

International-Two356,Contemplation.,"I, \[16 M\] have been contemplating suicide recently. I'm sorry if this isn't as long as the other posts here, it's just because I don't know what to say anymore. I feel trapped in a void of depression and anxiety, I overthink everything and I'm positive I'm the one holding my friend group down. I am socially awkward and I cannot make friends. I have one attempt from attempted OD, I tried OD'ing on ADHD Medication (Intuitiv and another medication I don't remember, I am off them now.) As a result, I was in the hospital for 5 days. I did well after that, I was SH free for a few years even. Now it's come back to haunt me, 20 minutes ago I almost did another attempt VIA suffocation (bag over the head.) I am lukewarm, I don't know if there is heaven or hell after death and I am afraid to find out. My dreams are to write poetry or even become a popular streamer or write novels. I have written poetry in my spare time in order to try and take my mind off of these intrusive thoughts, but nothing has worked. I am scared, I cannot lay down without looking over at multiple cords around my room and thinking ""I could make a noose out of that and end it."" I need advice, something. How can I get out of this?",international two 356 16 contemplating suicide recently sorry long post know say anymore feel trapped void depression anxiety overthink everything positive one holding friend group socially awkward cannot make friend one attempt attempted od tried od ing adhd medication intuitiv another medication remember result wa hospital 5 day well wa sh free year even come back haunt 20 minute ago almost another attempt via suffocation bag head lukewarm know heaven hell death afraid find dream write poetry even become popular streamer write novel written poetry spare time order try take mind intrusive thought nothing ha worked scared cannot lay without looking multiple cord around room thinking could make noose end need advice something get contemplation
cytotoxic-t-cell,I'm done.,"I'm honestly so done with life. There's nothing worth living for. The only reason why I'm still alive is that I don't want my family do deal with my death. I know if I die, my mum will kill herself, and I don't want that. My sister will be scarred for life, my brothers will be scarred for life, and my dad will die inside. 

You probably think ""you must be stupid, you have a family who love you, why are you suicidal?"" Truth is I don't care that I have a caring family. My mother has done so much shit that I honestly couldn't give 2 shits about her, my dad has never said the words ""I love you"" to me, neither have my 2 brothers. Yes, they probably do love me, but they for sure aren't fucking showing it. 

Your next thought might be ""just talk to your friends about whatever you're going through"". I've done that. I've talked to one friend, and she's an amazing person and all. Checked up on me every day, you get the point. But, no matter how hard she cares, it's not enough. She's just one person out of many who I consider my friends. I recently told some other people, who I consider close friends, that I've been really struggling over the past couple of months. I mean I was close to killing myself on multiple occasions type of struggling. I told them that I wanted to talk to them in-person - to explain what happened to me that made me so numb (this was done via snap, btw, I know, not ideal, but we were all isolating due to covid at the time). I saw them at university today - none of them said hi. None of them asked how I was. How I was feeling. Whether I wanted to talk. They didn't even say bye when they left. Why live when everyone around you (but one person) doesn't give a flying fuck. Maybe they do care, but they certainly aren't bloody showing it. 

No, I can't get better friends. Yes, I've tried. Partly, I don't want to get better friends, since my current friend group is ideal for me. We vibe, they just don't seem to care about how I'm personally doing. Yes, I know that means they don't care about me, I know. I have issues, ik.

Your next thought is ""get professional help"". That is one line I am not willing to cross, at least at this point in time. You see, I'm a medical student. If word comes out that I'm seeing a shrink, fuck knows what my peers will think of me. Fuck knows what the doctors who I'll be shadowing next year will think of me in the hospital next door. No matter how mainstream mental health is right now, deep inside people will see me as weak. In my field, this is not idea. Yes, I know, confidentiality, yada yada yada, unfortunately, confidentiality isn't really stuck well with where I am. 

I'm really fucking close to just ending it all, and I mean it. Every day I wake up with the thought that this might be the last time I wake up. There literally is 0 point to being alive for me at the moment. No one cares about me - why should I care about being alive?",cytotoxic cell honestly done life nothing worth living reason still alive want family deal death know die mum kill want sister scarred life brother scarred life dad die inside probably think must stupid family love suicidal truth care caring family mother ha done much shit honestly give 2 shit dad ha never said word love neither 2 brother yes probably love sure fucking showing next thought might talk friend whatever going done talked one friend amazing person checked every day get point matter hard care enough one person many consider friend recently told people consider close friend really struggling past couple month mean wa close killing multiple occasion type struggling told wanted talk person explain happened made numb wa done via snap btw know ideal isolating due covid time saw university today none said hi none asked wa wa feeling whether wanted talk even say bye left live everyone around one person give flying fuck maybe care certainly bloody showing get better friend yes tried partly want get better friend since current friend group ideal vibe seem care personally yes know mean care know issue ik next thought get professional help one line willing cross least point time see medical student word come seeing shrink fuck know peer think fuck know doctor shadowing next year think hospital next door matter mainstream mental health right deep inside people see weak field idea yes know confidentiality yada yada yada unfortunately confidentiality really stuck well really fucking close ending mean every day wake thought might last time wake literally 0 point alive moment one care care alive done

smileymalaise,I guess I’m not even sure what I’m asking for,"I’ve been dealing with crippling depression for over twenty years now, getting psychiatric care for most of it. I’ve dealt with a lot, more suicide attempts than I can remember, hospitalizations, I think I’ve had over 1000 stitches and staples from self harm (I’m not into that anymore), I’ve lived on the streets for about a decade, on Skid Row in LA, to West Oakland and Kansas City, Then Dallas… I’m back in Los Angeles now… living in a car.  
 

I’m posting this using my main account. Feel free to browse my nine year post history that started when I first got clean from heroin until now, where I’m perfectly sober but more miserable than I’ve ever been.  
 

I’ve been locked up a ton of times, like 14 arrests. It was dumb stuff like drug possession like ten years ago but still, I can never live down the stigma. Getting a job has been one of the toughest challenges yet. I’ve built up an IT resume with achievements and tons of experience, but it’s very rare I can get the single odd temp job thrown my way.  
 

I was raised in a cult, a strict fundamentalist pastors family. I went to a music school in Hollywood after high school and got disowned by my parents for using cocaine. In college. In music school. In Hollywood. Fucking assholes. My biological dad is dead, mom is an alcoholic and I don’t talk to her.  
 

I’ve had my heart broken more times than I can count. I’ve been in long term relationships and I’ve even had a son I had to give up for adoption. I overcame a 6 year heroin addiction. On the streets I had been slamming heroin and cocaine, overdosing more times than I can remember. I’ve woken up with paramedics on tops of me, in strange alleys, I lived in a burned down warehouse in South Central LA for two months. My life has had ups and downs, but with a general downward trend for some time.  
 

My whole life, my biggest problem has been a lack of interest in things. I am however empathetic and emotionally there… I can’t find anything to interest me. I have an “ambivalence towards life” is how one of my shrinks put it. I don’t care about anything but here’s the real fucked up part: I really WANT to care. I read self care books and all the famous books people talk about. I learn as much about science and math and history as I can, all day watching videos and scrolling Reddit…   
 

My heart is broken everyday when I see people smiling and laughing and raising families and I know deep down I can never be a part of their world. Happiness exists… but not for me. And I’ve long accepted this. But how long is this supposed to last? I keep soldiering on, living in some of the worst conditions in the US. I’m surrounded by darkness and sorrow and despair.  
 

I think I want to live, but at what cost? I want help but my friends either ignore me or tell me I should be locked up in a psych ward. That is not help. I’m screaming into an empty room. But I guess I’m not even sure what it is I’m screaming for.",smiley malaise dealing crippling depression twenty year getting psychiatric care dealt lot suicide attempt remember hospitalization think 1000 stitch staple self harm anymore lived street decade skid row la west oakland kansa city dallas back los angeles living car posting using main account feel free browse nine year post history started first got clean heroin perfectly sober miserable ever locked ton time like 14 arrest wa dumb stuff like drug possession like ten year ago still never live stigma getting job ha one toughest challenge yet built resume achievement ton experience rare get single odd temp job thrown way wa raised cult strict fundamentalist pastor family went music school hollywood high school got disowned parent using cocaine college music school hollywood fucking asshole biological dad dead mom alcoholic talk heart broken time count long term relationship even son give adoption overcame 6 year heroin addiction street slamming heroin cocaine overdosing time remember woken paramedic top strange alley lived burned warehouse south central la two month life ha ups general downward trend time whole life biggest problem ha lack interest thing however empathetic emotionally find anything interest ambivalence towards life one shrink put care anything real fucked part really want care read self care book famous book people talk learn much science math history day watching video scrolling reddit heart broken everyday see people smiling laughing raising family know deep never part world happiness exists long accepted long supposed last keep soldiering living worst condition u surrounded darkness sorrow despair think want live cost want help friend either ignore tell locked psych ward help screaming empty room guess even sure screaming guess even sure asking

young_nightskies,I Just Want Someone To Take Care of Me (13F),"Minor details have been changed to protect those involved. And to keep them from finding this post. 

I went to my mother asking her to take care of me. She turned on me and made it all about her, her and her friend that killed herself. I didn't even try my Dad, he's more of a suicidal mess than I am, and about half as emotionally intelligent. 

I don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm sad a lot. It's lonely, here. It's so lonely. I want to be angry at my mother, to hold a grudge, but I just can't do it. I love her too much. I'm still surprised she reacted like she did, we're normally so close. I just can't stay angry at her, but she hurt me so much. And now I'm all alone.

I don't understand how I'm both so angry at her and just want her approval so much at the same time. I just want her to be proud of me. The worst part is, she *says* she's proud of me, but I just can't make myself believe it. It's not her fault I can't believe her, that one's mine. She's an honest woman, she says what she thinks, often times to the point where it upsets and confuses other people. 

She praises my guitar-playing skills, but I can't think about anything except how bad I must sound, how I just can't get the bridge to *Friday I'm In Love* right, or how I've been playing with the capo on lopsided for the past ten minutes. She praises my fanfiction, but I just can't think about how it'll never be as good as the source material, how she'll never be as invested in it as she would be if it was the original material. 

Why is it that even when I get what I want, I'm still not happy? I do want her praise, right? That *is* What I want? 

If it's not, then what *do* I want? 

I've been watching this show called *Power Rangers Lost Galaxy* the past few days, and there's one character in it I adore. Her name is Kendrix Morgan, and she's so great. I wish I could just *be* her, instead of this idiot teenager who still desperately wants to go back to being eleven. 

What makes Kendrix so wonderful? 

What's the difference between her and everyone else? 

How is she so naturally good? 

It's not like she's real, anyway. I guess I can put those questions to rest. But I just like Kendrix so much. 

Well, this ramble has gone on too long, so I'll say goodbye. I don't understand everything with my mother, I don't understand my own stupid emotions, I just want to be Kendrix who's smart and kind, and also a a bonus dies at the end to save everyone, *and* comes back! I just want my mother to take care of me, I just want to stop hurting.

Terrible-Memory4801,I want to be brave enough to end my life,"I want to commit suicide, but i’m too scared of doing it. It’s so frustrating, because I genuinely don’t want to be here anymore. I see myself having no future, and I can’t cope with the constant misery. I cause my family too much pain, and im overridden with guilt. I’ve tried meds and counselling, and yet i feel as though i’m the lowest i’ve ever been. I’m burned out, and I have no energy to do anything about it anymore. I’m sick of fighting how i feel, because i always end up in the same rut, no matter how hard i try. And every time i end up in this same rut, it gets more and more disappointing. I’ve convinced myself that happiness isn’t real, and everyone else is faking it. I just feel like everyone just exists, and then we die. 
I just wish i could take matters into my own hands and be brave enough to do it.
I’ve gotten to a point where I just feel like a complete burden. I get tired of myself, never mind the people around me. Depression has honestly turned me into this horrible, angry, selfish person, and i don’t like anything about me anymore.. I honestly feel like going through with ending my life would give everyone a sense of relief. I understand that some people will be upset, but in the long run, it would be peaceful without me. There would be no more meltdowns, no more disappointment, no more worrying about me… 
I’ve never felt this way before, It’s strange. It just feels like the end, like there’s nothing left for me.

School is my only safe haven where i can be called what i like and truly feel like myself but that's gone now. I have a teacher who continues deadnaming me and when confronted about it i was essentially told to suck it up and deal with it. 

I can't take it anymore. Hearing my deadname is something so insanely triggering to me and i don't want to continue being targeted and harassed for just wanting to be called a new name. On top of that i've been diagnosed with depression and ocd which i have been dealing with for quite a bit. I know I'm young and ""have my whole life ahead of me"" or whatever but i can't do this for much longer. this isn't the first time and wont be the last. it hurts more than anyone could ever imagine, and i have no trans or nonbinary friends so there is no one who could understand. 

all i wanted was to be taken seriously. spring break is in 2 weeks and im flying out to visit my father. he owns several guns and likes going to shooting ranges, so i think i'll do it then. you guys might be the only people i ever tell about this. i just wish it couldve been different.",iac kuo hi im sophmore highschool came trans non binary person last year quarantine however family know school safe called like truly feel like gone teacher continues deadnaming confronted wa essentially told suck deal take anymore hearing deadname something insanely triggering want continue targeted harassed wanting called new name top diagnosed depression ocd dealing quite bit know young whole life ahead whatever much longer first time wont last hurt anyone could ever imagine trans nonbinary friend one could understand wanted wa taken seriously spring break 2 week im flying visit father owns several gun like going shooting range think guy might people ever tell wish couldve different 15 nb keep getting disrespected teacher gender take anymore im thinking killing spring break

Tall_Penalty_9678,"My boyfriend is harming and isolating himself. Im worried, how can I help him?","Long post, sorry..  
I have a boyfriend who is diagnosed with depression and has suicidal thoughts. They started to self-harm themselves again after weeks of not doing so.A little backstory, we are in a Long Distance Relationship and known each other for half a year, he won't let me visit him until December this year, but I'm worried something happens until then. He has been starting to get distant and isolates himself since a week, states he wants to be alone, I'm not sure if he needs alone time or if it's because of his depression.I'm scared he'll do something or that his wounds open again, two days ago he said he's been tasting blood in his mouth 24/7 because a rather big wound opened which wasn't fully healed yet and he didn't deny that he didn't self-harm.

I have talked to him about therapy once last year, but as far as I know he doesn't go nor does he want to. He is hesitant and doesn't open up when talking about his depression or suicidal thoughts, the only times I witness or hear from it is when it's happening and he has a breakdown. I can't even ask him how he feels daily, he doesn't like answering that question and I found out it's because he doesn't want to lie to me. When I ask him how his day was, he says he doesn't know.

I'm at loss. I've never dealt with someone who is depressed or has suicidal thoughts before, how can I approach him if he doesn't want to talk about his depression or thoughts? He's already tried to attempt suicide a few times before he met me, I'm scared he'll try again. He said he will tell me if he'd die, but I don't want that day to come. We do plan to have a future together eventually, but I'm just so scared. I don't want to lose him. I love him. I'm always checking up on him daily, sending messages, making apparent I'm here, sometimes making little gifts like drawings.

He lives alone (with a few cats), his sister is in a coma right now and he doesn't have any other family members. He lives so far away, I did tell him if he'd let me I'd come visit immediately, but he didn't respond to that. Generally, he always reponds so late these days and sometimes completely ignores - as I've mentioned, being distant and isolating himself (but he did say he want to be alone a bit a week ago but since he's harmed himself again two days ago I'm not sure).

He pretty much hates (humanity) human interaction, only has few people he ""withstands"", likes, I'm one of them. I get that that might be a reason he won't go to therapy, but ultimately I don't know. He doesn't open up to me and I only know what's happening when he has breakdowns.

Please, any help is appreciated, what can I do? I can't get through him. I'm scared. He says he's fine, but his behavior tells me otherwise. I'm scared. I've been trying to research for days on how I could help him, I don't know. He wouldn't possibly consider therapy.",tall penalty 9678 long post sorry boyfriend diagnosed depression ha suicidal thought started self harm week little backstory long distance relationship known half year let visit december year worried something happens ha starting get distant isolates since week state want alone sure need alone time depression scared something wound open two day ago said tasting blood mouth 24 7 rather big wound opened fully healed yet deny self harm talked therapy last year far know go doe want hesitant open talking depression suicidal thought time witness hear happening ha breakdown even ask feel daily like answering question found want lie ask day wa say know loss never dealt someone depressed ha suicidal thought approach want talk depression thought already tried attempt suicide time met scared try said tell die want day come plan future together eventually scared want lose love always checking daily sending message making apparent sometimes making little gift like drawing life alone cat sister coma right family member life far away tell let come visit immediately respond generally always reponds late day sometimes completely ignores mentioned distant isolating say want alone bit week ago since harmed two day ago sure pretty much hate humanity human interaction ha people withstands like one get might reason go therapy ultimately know open know happening ha breakdown please help appreciated get scared say fine behavior tell otherwise scared trying research day could help know possibly consider therapy boyfriend harming isolating im worried help

COVID hit and it was just a slow decline from there. stopped going to the gym, stopped caring in general. it is just so strange because there is no sadness, just a lack of will to do anything. the only sadness is dwelling on past opportunities that i couldnt take because of something out of my control. i cant get my college work done and i have a horrible attendance rate. nearly all of my scholarship has vanished into thin air from shit grades obviously. im such an asshole, just taking advantage of people and never giving back, manipulating for my own gain. i have a hatred for people in general. i was well on my way to just being another rich pos who clowns on the less fortunate. now it is me who is less fortunate. the only thing left to question is what method im going to leave the living by, as this has been on my mind for the past year now almost. it is both ego and uncertainty of the cost of seeking help as to why i didnt try seeking a therapist or something like that (mental health isnt real in asian households). the people around me have been deceived so incredibly hard i have no real way of just dropping the bomb on them that i am insanely fucked up and have insanely fucked up. i dont know what i seek from this subreddit as i usually just laugh at people complain on reddit. this is so fucking ironic. i guess this is what i get for people a terrible person, probably would have gotten got later in life anyways. i just dont see a way out of this one. im such a coward, literally trying to find the easiest, painless death possible and plan on destroying hard drive, phone, and attempting to scrub myself from the internet so all there are only questions and no answers",throwaway xd 243234521 idea happened always 1 everything everything except loving parent full ride scholarship get paid monthly attend uni easiest existence ever covid hit wa slow decline stopped going gym stopped caring general strange sadness lack anything sadness dwelling past opportunity couldnt take something control cant get college work done horrible attendance rate nearly scholarship ha vanished thin air shit grade obviously im asshole taking advantage people never giving back manipulating gain hatred people general wa well way another rich po clown le fortunate le fortunate thing left question method im going leave living ha mind past year almost ego uncertainty cost seeking help didnt try seeking therapist something like mental health isnt real asian household people around deceived incredibly hard real way dropping bomb insanely fucked insanely fucked dont know seek subreddit usually laugh people complain reddit fucking ironic guess get people terrible person probably would gotten got later life anyways dont see way one im coward literally trying find easiest painless death possible plan destroying hard drive phone attempting scrub internet question answer easiest path success destruction
UselessPersonLol,I am useless. I don't know what to do.,"It's a constant battle to do anything. To cook. To clean. To do my share of the chores. To get some information from my dad and write it down so I remember it. It's just my internal voice screaming or pleading with myself to get up, to do something. But I sit there. Doing mostly nothing at all. Wanting to cry or wanting to die because I'm just a lazy sack who can't do the simplest of tasks. My fiancé wants me to cook three meals a week and clean sometimes. Easy. It's been nearly a year and her pleads with me mimic my internal voice. I can't do it. No matter what plan or goals or charts or any plan I try. Whatever part of my brain that creates self motivation has withered away years ago. It caused me to flame out of college twice and barely scrape my way to a useless liberal arts degree. I am only capable of productivity when I am forced into it (job for money) or threatened by something external (parents growing up, now fiancé). 

the pills don't help. I've tried so many different therapists and doses of four different ADHD pills and three different depression meds and I just sit. I do nothing. The only serve to make me cry less and make it so I can go to work and brush my teeth. Which is something, I suppose. But not enough. Not enough for me to ever be a good partner, father, or really do anything involving another person. I suppose I could take care of a dog. Might be my hard limit there. 

There is no reason for me to be like this. I have no traumas, no dark past, no rough upbringing. I have two parents in a happy marriage who love me more than life in a middle class house in a great school district. I was a bit of a weird kid growing up but i had friends, I was happy. No deaths in the family to speak of. No tragedies or traumas. No reason I shouldn't be a perfectly normal person. But the pills don't help and the therapists have no idea why I'm like this. 

I love my fiancé more than anything. She is my opposite. For starters, she has actual reasons to be sad. Find any psych textbook, rip out all the types of trauma, put them on a dart board, and toss a dart blindfolded at it and you'll be bound to hit something she has experienced. And yet she persists. She keeps going. She drives herself through the tears and the suicidality and the self loathing and stress of all she does and she keeps going and EXCELLS. Top of her class, top employee wherever she graces with her presence. And it all comes from within. I look at her in awe and pride. So smart, so driven, so kind. A bright future. She is truly what I wish I was. And I have to set her free. I can't keep her trapped with me. She won't leave me. She yells and screams and begs and pleads with me because I know deep down she loves me but I really don't think she'll leave me. But she has to. I used to get panic attacks at the thought of her leaving but ever since we moved in together they have subsided significantly. I first thought it was because I was more secure in the relationship now that we've taken it to the next level (moving in, getting engaged) but that's not it at all. I think I welcome her leaving me. I think I know deep down I won't get better and she has to free herself from me, from my failure. 

I don't know if I want to kill myself. I don't think I will do it. Maybe on my own in a little apartment with nobody to disappoint I'll be able to keep going. Maybe tread water. I have a decent job that I like after all, and a few friends. But I worry that I won't be able to stay away from her. Or at least ever move on. And that suggests to me that I have to end my life to free her. Maybe that's dramatic, maybe I'll have the restraint to leave her alone. I probably will. But can I ever get there? Will either of us have the nuts to leave the other? I don't think I will. I love her too much to rip off the bandage even though i know I'm broken. That I can't get better. That I can't ruin her life by staying in it.",useless person lol constant battle anything cook clean share chore get information dad write remember internal voice screaming pleading get something sit mostly nothing wanting cry wanting die lazy sack simplest task fiancé want cook three meal week clean sometimes easy nearly year pleads mimic internal voice matter plan goal chart plan try whatever part brain creates self motivation ha withered away year ago caused flame college twice barely scrape way useless liberal art degree capable productivity forced job money threatened something external parent growing fiancé pill help tried many different therapist dos four different adhd pill three different depression med sit nothing serve make cry le make go work brush teeth something suppose enough enough ever good partner father really anything involving another person suppose could take care dog might hard limit reason like trauma dark past rough upbringing two parent happy marriage love life middle class house great school district wa bit weird kid growing friend wa happy death family speak tragedy trauma reason perfectly normal person pill help therapist idea like love fiancé anything opposite starter ha actual reason sad find psych textbook rip type trauma put dart board toss dart blindfolded bound hit something ha experienced yet persists keep going drive tear suicidality self loathing stress doe keep going excells top class top employee wherever grace presence come within look awe pride smart driven kind bright future truly wish wa set free keep trapped leave yell scream begs pleads know deep love really think leave ha used get panic attack thought leaving ever since moved together subsided significantly first thought wa wa secure relationship taken next level moving getting engaged think welcome leaving think know deep get better ha free failure know want kill think maybe little apartment nobody disappoint able keep going maybe tread water decent job like friend worry able stay away least ever move suggests end life free maybe dramatic maybe restraint leave alone probably ever get either u nut leave think love much rip bandage even though know broken get better ruin life staying useless know

holywatertears,First post ever,"So I searched on google ""I haven't been okay for a while"" and it brought me here. I don't really know what to say, this is my first time ever using Reddit. But what I hope is for change. Good change. In me. In my life. That would not make me feel this way anymore. I felt this way a long time ago and it only got worse and worse. Until it was really bad and I think I went into survival mode for a long time. There it got better, for a while. When I faced some of these bad thoughts head-on, I thought I got better, I really did. For a while, things seemed to be good. But now it's bad again and all I'm wondering is was it all a lie? did I live in denial all this time? was it bad the whole time but am I only recognizing it now or did I fall into that darkness again? IDK which is worse though. I don't know if I am suicidal and I'm sorry if that makes me unsuitable to post here but I really just wanted to talk to someone who understands. I read another post read that said something about not wanting to bother friends and ruin their day with my shit and I relate to that, which made me think someone out here may relate to how I feel. I wrote some stuff on this journal I have a little earlier when I was crying and crying and IDK if anyone is interested in reading that. But seeing what I wrote made me feel sad that this is what I am. Thank you for reading this if you have reached this far. There are so many more things I wanna say but I am just tired. Of everyone. Of everything.

Jayco_02,My Note- I feel like giving up soon.,"Dear Sabrina,

  I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry Sabrina, but I don't think I can do this anymore. It hurts so much and I can't think straight anymore. I'm such a fucking coward but I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore. I feel so inhuman and garbage and I just can't take it anymore, I give up.  I don't think I can endure the possible years of therapy and medicine, feeling emotionless and void, it scares me so much and I don't know why. 

  And please don't take this as your fault, you have done nothing wrong against me. You have been nothing but great and awesome to me and you were honestly the girl of my dreams. The girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. The girl I wanted to share memories with. The girl that carries our children. And I'm sorry but I honestly don't think I'm going to be able to grow anymore. I feel so stuck in this never ending cycle and I just don't want to be in this Earth anymore. I'm so tired of hurting myself, and hurting you, and others in my life, I feel so evil. I just can't do it anymore. 

  I love you so much Sabrina. I really do, with all my heart. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong for you and for what I'm about to do now. And I know that no amount of words or actions could ever pardon me from this, but I hate my life so much. You were one of the only good things to come into my life and I ruined it. I ruined our relationship. I ruined the love we have for one another to point where we had to take a break. 

  I feel like every chance I get to turn my life around and be better, I just ruin and destroy it. And I'm sorry for doing this. I'm sorry for causing you to hurt. To feel guilty. I'm sorry for making you feel neglected at times. I'm sorry for not being there all the time. For the nights I've fallen asleep early. For the moments I've gotten snippy with you or lashed out on you. I know I wasn't the best boyfriend on the planet, but when I'm with you, it made me want to be. It made me want to try and be the best boyfriend I could possibly be and I couldn't have even done that.

  There's so much pain that I've brought to you that I could never forgive myself for. You've shown me so many wonders and the truest love I could have ever felt and I repaid that back in tainted love, emoty promises, and disrespect. I honestly don't deserve the love and compassion you've shown me. I treated you so unfairly. And again please don't think that this is your fault, because it's not, and please don't feel guilty. I'm the one who made the wrong decisions and continue to do so. Please don't forget that I loved you, and please don't think too long of me. I always loved you and I always will. You have been the star in my empty night sky and I loved being able to say that I was yours.
 
 I wish you the best of luck in this life. I hope that you're able to succeed in digital art, psychology, engineering, or whatever the future holds for you. You are a talented, honest, awesome person and I know you're going to do great things in life. And I know that you'll find someone who can treat you 1000× better than I ever did, and lead a happy family with them. I'm sorry it couldn't have been me. And I'm sorry for hurting you this one last time. But I know you're strong, and you can overcome anything. 

  Please don't ever forget how beautiful you are. Or how your voice is that of the singing birds. Or how your smile could melt anyone's heart. You are the most perfect woman on this planet, please don't ever forget that.

   This is my final goodbye Sabrina, if I've sent this to you it means that I've killed myself or am currently attempting. And I know this is going to hurt a lot, but I can't do it anymore. Everyday it feels like I'm being stabbed in the heart and in the chest and I just want it to stop. Goodbye my soulmate, my princess, my love, my wife, the love of my short lived life. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

Love,

Triangle-Buddy,Just end it please,"I hate work, this corporate grind is soul sucking but it’s all I can do if I ever want a financially stable life. The fact I have no choice makes it worse.

Most friends are shitty fair weather friends. I thought I wanted lots of friends but pretty much everyone is fake and an asshole. Real friendship is impossible with all but one person.

I’m the scapegoat of my family. I’ll always be a problem that can’t be solved, and even when I do my best for them I’m still somehow the problem.

My health is out of whack all of the sudden for no reason. This could be a blessing in disguise if it kills me young but before then I’m just dealing with painful symptoms.

And worst of all, the one person I actually care about has even worse health problems that aren’t getting better. It may be cancer and if they need to be hospitalized again they outright said they won’t get treatment bc they “can’t afford it”, so it’s possible they’ll just die even if it’s preventable bc of cost. Leaving me all alone. This is by far the worst of everything. I can’t do this without them. They’re the only light in this fucked up world and if I lose them I just can’t anymore.

Just end it now. I’m sick of living and drowning the pain with weed and hard drugs. I just want my friend to be ok and for this pain to end. I hope my high blood pressure is a sign I’ll get a heart attack and die, obviously this life will continue to shit on me. I should have known that when I finally found someone who made it worth it that this would happen. Life is pure agony and I’m sick of it. I just want it to end. I just want to die already.",triangle buddy hate work corporate grind soul sucking ever want financially stable life fact choice make worse friend shitty fair weather friend thought wanted lot friend pretty much everyone fake asshole real friendship impossible one person scapegoat family always problem solved even best still somehow problem health whack sudden reason could blessing disguise kill young dealing painful symptom worst one person actually care ha even worse health problem getting better may cancer need hospitalized outright said get treatment bc afford possible die even preventable bc cost leaving alone far worst everything without light fucked world lose anymore end sick living drowning pain weed hard drug want friend ok pain end hope high blood pressure sign get heart attack die obviously life continue shit known finally found someone made worth would happen life pure agony sick want end want die already end please

Tumahub79,Getting Help has Consequences. That is sickening.,"I'm suicidal.  I've made it clear to several mental health professionals that my time is limited by choice.  In 1.5 years the suicide clause in my insurance goes away.  They say the same shit every time: ""Go to the hospital if you're having an emergency.""  

I simply can't afford it.  To lose the money from an indefinite amount of hospital stay where people lie to me about how good life is is absurd.  This is the United States of America.  I fucking tried and failed.  It's been over for too long, if not from the beginning.  I would lose my job and have no support, losing my belongings and home as well.  With no social support from a family nor friend it's like I don't exist.  I wouldn't be missed if I wouldn't simply be.

My company give very little time off for anything.  In fact, it gives very little in general.  This is the US after all.  But I digress...

If I can't go to a hospital to get convinced that life is worth it, and therapists, psychiatrists, and social workers all fail to convince me as well, then are my options really just to blow out my brainstem or live in anguish?

I've decided to give up on that. It's too painful and hurts people close to me too much.

My new plan is, to proceed with things like nothing is wrong. To put up a facade and to do everything I can to hide everything I'm feeling.

Then, when I move into an apartment, I'll kill myself. No warning. No build up. Just sudden and quick.

I realize that I always wanted my death to be exactly that, and doing everything I can to make my death a slow process is only making it harder to kill myself if anything.

Minimum_Locksmith_76,i don’t see the point of living anymore,"to be frank, i haven’t been genuinely happy at all and i can’t recall the last time i was. im not surviving or living anymore it’s just existence. i don’t have much to live for. im a shit human being. im utilitarian and thing is, nothing every goes my way and it just sucks. Why do I try so hard in a world that is against me? Why do I live for people who don’t care about me? I love so many things but they don’t love me do they? Why does my existence not make difference? Why is it that I am a waste of space? I have so many questions. Of course, I am grateful for these legs that have carried me for so long but at the same time, I don’t think my heart can beat any longer. Nobody loves me, genuinely. Say you love me or whatever but we both know that shit ain’t true because I don’t even love myself. How come my conscience, the one I spend the most time with, hates every single atom that exists on this piece of meat I call my body. How come I can only feel pain? How come the only flowers ill receive is on my grave? How come so many bad things happen to me? It’s just repetitive at this point and I just want to end it. I’m doing it after my exams next year. I can’t do this anymore


Ever since I was a child, nobody even cared. Hair was matted and I hadn’t showered for weeks until it had to be chopped off. Nobody cared to eat dinner with me. Nobody cared to do anything that involved the existence of myself.

Sonova_Vondruke,"I'm being torn apart, I want to be free of this pain.","... I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

That line in The Force Awakens reminds me so much of how I feel when I stop ignoring what I really want. And what I want, is to not hate being alive. No matter what I do, it's the wrong decision or it's so poorly done, that doing nothing is typically the better choice. Everything I try to do just falls apart, like Midas but instead of gold, everything turns to ash and rot. Suicide doesn't seem like the best choice, just the only choice that I know will work, for me at least. The only thing stopping me is the wave of more entropy that it creates.. or I guess, escalates... since everything in the universe eventually returns to the cold blackness of existence. I'm running on empty, fumes of hope rolling me to a destination that will have me forever stalled on the highway of life, and all I can do is watch as people pass me by with nothing more than a beep-beep.. either as a notice of existence or annoyance. Which is probably more than I can hope for, but nothing more than what I deserve.

It's only a matter of time.

Specific-Ebb-7285,I feel selfish for living,"I want to die so bad for the people around me, and staying alive makes me feel selfish. I have no real value, and do not add any type of productiveness to society. I despise working my life away for people that give absolutely no fucks about me just to make ends meet and “get by”. I am fully aware of ALL of my faults, and wish I could change for the better, but I never do. It’s an “out of sight, out of mind” type of situation. Every single night, I reflect on how fucking terrible I am for my kids, for my girlfriend, and for everyone around me, and how I can do better the next day, but I do nothing to ever actually fix it. I’m lazy, always pissed off at the smallest shit, been smoking weed and cigarettes for 18 years of my 30 being alive, and if I were to try to stop would actually murder someone from pure anger that I have no control over. I can go from the most empathetic person around, to the most violent and have NO regard for anyone else’s feelings. 

Every day that I wake up, I feel like I’m being forced back into a body and existence I want nothing to do with. I do not dream, and have no sense of anything from the time I finally fall asleep to the time I’m drug from a hibernation-like sleep. When I finally awake, it feels like I’ve just been drug from wherever I am, to be put back into this bullshit reality. It takes at least an hour every day to get back to feeling “normal” once I wake, and then I spend the day just trying to get through it. 

I see every day how I’m ruining my kids’ lives and being the worst example anyone could imagine, like putting them off to play games on the computer just to try to escape the reality I live in. I have no discernible skills that I can teach them, outside of how to hustle or manipulate people, which is NOT what I want for them. I honestly feel as if the only way to help my children not be like me, is to not be alive. I have no hope, and see no light, yet I’m stuck clinging onto this waste of a life and it makes me feel so bad because I know the only way to change is to die. 

I refuse to “seek help” or take medication because of multiple reasons. These people don’t *know* what it’s like and almost every single person I’ve been to in the past is there for a paycheck. They do not give a fuck about you, or your problems, and they’re patronizing as fuck. The medications I’ve been on have made me even more angry than I already am, made me much more suicidal and emotional, and even given me twitches. I don’t want to be stuck on a medication every day for the rest of my life, to feel “normal”. 

I have accepted that there is no real reason as to why we exist. It’s nothing more than an energy cycle, just like everything else. Our existence is pointless, just waiting to die. So why can’t I just fucking do it? Why do I continue to make everyone else’s life so bad, just so I can regret being here more? There is so much more I feel, and want to say, but can’t even think or put into words.

microwaveoperator,It's over for me,"I don't think anyone will read this, and that's fine. When I was 13 (21 now) was the first time I ever planned it. Of course I didn't go through with it, being rational and thinking if I just make it another 2 years, I'll look back and laugh. Two years went by, and I did not laugh. But I decided to wait another 2 years and look back. Still didn't laugh. At 17 due to stupid circumstances I had to move out and take care of myself. For a while, this made me feel good actually. That is until my job at UPS dried up and I was forced to look elsewhere. The next one was fucking awful, I don't want to get into it but I lasted longer than any other new-hire they had. I got into fights and shouting matches with people I hated fucking seeing every day. This time I came very, very close until I met this girl, now my ex, who made me once again feel optimistic about being alive. Throughout our relationship, I would constantly quit jobs, go unemployed for a few months, living off my savings then jump to another one I hated. After 3 years of living in this townhouse that kept having issues, I decided that I couldn't keep working 12-14 hours and returning to my depressing room that I hate. I truly wanted to make the jump and pursue my purpose. I sat in the basement one night, after my sibling told me she would never contact me again when this is all over, yet again looking back and thinking why didn't I just wrap this all up when I was 13? Sure, I had some interesting and fun times, but nothing meaningful to me. I gained lots of wisdom, but no where to apply it. It really dawned on me just how pointless it all was. The experiences I had did not make up for all of the pain. My grandmother telling me I belong in the dark, my mother gaslighting and using witchcraft against me. I'm only slightly skimming the surface here, I'm not here to tell my life story really. I decided I had nothing to fucking lose, so I decided to live in the car to force myself away from bills, and to force myself to be outside and not in my room. I had also started a clothing brand in which I put my heart and soul into, and always get compliments on my designs when people see me wearing it. I really wanted to just wrap my life up, because the life I want to live keeps fleeing from me. So I told myself one last time, you can end it here in this basement or you can try ONE more time and look back on this day. I lived in the car for 4 months, without plates or registration, knocking out my whole list of shit I had to get together, working in the library on my brand and another business opportunity that came up in the summer. My job called me back, after I quit a month prior, and I was running low on cash, so I took it. 12-14 hours hard labor, then I'd hit the gym before they closed to shower, then find a good parking lot and sleep for a few hours just to repeat. Eventually I got fired for flipping out on a motherfucker that gave me issues for no reason, I think because this girl had a crush on me, and shortly after found myself living in an office my associates and I decided we needed to continue our business, which I'm losing faith more and more but I keep pushing forward. I'm now at the final point, where I look back at my day in that basement and realize I'm no where near where I pleaded with God to put me. My car got stolen and I'm stuck. I get to shower maybe once a week. I feel nothing but isolation. I sold everything over time so I could keep surviving. I had to sell stocks when they were low and now they're worth twice what I sold them for. I don't even cry anymore when I think about ending my life. After many sessions of looking within myself, my brain has completely rationalized this. I cannot and will not go much longer. I have an official date set in which I've thought out carefully. I see angelic signs and repeating numbers that tell me I'm on the right track, but I'm at the point where I think I'm just being spiritually fucked with. If by the date I set, it doesn't start to look up, I rationally figure it never will. If my businesses don't make it and I have to go back to hard labor 12-14 hours a day, there's just no reason for me to keep going. I'm meant for so much more than this. I feel I've wasted my best years, my young years. Most people I come into contact with think highly of me, and assume I'm going places. I do everything I can to uplift those around me and convince them to keep going with optimism. Lately I've been having very dark thoughts about hurting everyone that has hurt me. You'd never look at me and think I would be having these thoughts. My mind goes to dark places every single day, usually about how I'm not good enough and I'm a piece of shit and the world would actually be a better place without me. Boo fucking hoo lol. Anyways, I have no one to share this with and figured I'd just spill it out somewhere. I truly hope anyone reading this finds purpose in their lives. If not, I don't blame you for rationalizing it yourself unfortunately. At this point in my life, I can't tell you it gets better nor do I expect it to anymore.

ZealousidealOwl9635,I have to put this somewhere,"I'm feeling suicidal.  I've felt this way in the past. There are many times I wished I was killed before I ever had children.  When my oldest was 6, I attempted suicide the day after Christmas.  I wasn't trying to ruin the holidays.  I had just been depressed for so long.  I kept everything inside to myself.  I made an appointment to see a therapist the week before,  but my appointment was 3 weeks away.  That night I called the suicide prevention hotline, but I never got through to anyone.   I was in hold for an extremely long time.  I decided to seek help from my family.  I told my boyfriend at the time that I was feeling suicidal,  and to please don't leave me.  He told me to go and kill myself.  Then he took our daughter to his grandmother's house.  I called my mom,  and she told me that she was tired of my drama.  I called my dad, and he told me to stop the noise. I called my sister,  and she didn't pick up.  I was upset for many reasons.  One was that I wanted to leave my ""boyfriend"", but he wouldn't let me. He was extremely emotionally abusive to me. He would lie about any and every little thing.  Then I catch him in a lie sad he screamed at me for bugging him.  He screamed at me for keeping tabs in him like he's a kid. He threatened to abandon me everyday for a period in time.  One day I decided to help him pack, so his clothes wouldn't get wrinkled,  and he beat me up.  I didn't tell my family the ins and outs of our relationship, and they liked him. He would complain to my family that I'm so sensitive and I ask a million questions.  They believed him, and then add their input.  Mom would add that I was a terrorist when I was ready.  My mom thinking I was a terrorist,  was just me trying to explain to her why I was sad. My mom never wanted to hear that I was sad.  She doesn't believe in mental health.   My crying in my bed at night would get my screamed at.   My dad hates emotions,  the end.  My childhood with him was him screaming ""stop the noise"", when I cried.  My parents definitely hugged me and kissed me, just never when I was sad or upset.  They never tried to comfort me. The fact that I am admittedly sensitive,  and get sad easily,  makes that fact worse.  My mom treated me differently from my sister, because by the time I lived with only her, I reminded her of my dad, whom she hated. I think my sister was blind to the fact that we can do the exact same thing,  and I would get treated so harshly.  I was tired of the world,  so I took half a bottle of aspirin.  I was hoping go bleed out. I was in the psychiatric ward for 3 weeks after they gave me activated charcoal. I was humiliated.  My parents never acknowledged that I called them that day.  My dad had the nerve to ask me ""what happened"" when he visited me in the hospital.  I told him that I had a headache and took too much aspirin.  He acted like he believed me, then said I was crazy for not knowing better.  I honestly don't know if he believes it, or if he knows the truth, and just refuses to bring it up. I literally told him what i was going to do 2 hours before. My mother called a few times while I was in the hospital.  My sister never called.  I felt even more alone and ignored than ever.  I tried suicide a few times after that. I took an entire package of caffeine pills. I just ended up in the hospital,  and I tried to pass it off as food poisoning.  The doctors gave me a toxic screen because my heart was racing.  Apparently they don't check for caffeine,  because it came back negative.  I tried to drown myself.  I once stood on the edge of a 6 story building,  wondering if it was high enough,  or if I was just going to hurt myself.  I was drinking vodka, trying to get my nerves up. I didn't jump, because I know someone who tried,  and survived,  they just weren't right after that. I didn't have access to a taller building.   I darted out in traffic.  The last time I thought about suicide,  I thought about a suicide hood.  I wanted a hood, and to make it airtight,  and have helium replace the oxygen.   It was supposed to be peaceful,  but for some reason,  I didn't go through with it.  Obviously,  I never told my family again,  even when they had to pick me up from the hospital. I told my family,  thinking they just didn't know how bad I felt, and they would tell me something to make me seem like I was overreacting,  and that I was cared about. Instead they showed me that me being unhappy,  was a personal affront to them.  That's how I saw it my entire life,  I was simply hoping that they would finally show me that wasn't the case.  They showed me that I was right all along and that they were well aware of what they were doing to me.  I didn't need to fo through that more than once.  If I wanted to die, they had no intention of showing me that they wanted me around.  They would rather me gone if I was going to be sad and cry.  I was fine for a while.  I went through bad times,  but I was living,  and making it through. All my desires to die, was tied to a relationship. All of them.  I was finally in a good place, alone.  Then someone came and my emotions peaked again.  I hare seeing people sad. It reminds me of all the times when I was sad, and no one would even attempt to help me through a dark period.  They just got mad that I was not happy,  and letting them know.  I know What it's like to go through a rough patch, and keep it to yourself.  I know for many, the homicidal and suicidal thoughts are there, unspoken to most, if not everyone.  I try to be there for everyone.  I feel physical pain, if I see someone in emotional pain,  and I don't try to be there. That's what I would have wanted. Everyone in my family always says how kind I am. Thay I always go out of my way for others.  If they see that,,why are they so cruel to me, when I need emotional support?   My dad can't be that to anyone.  My mom however,  is just that for my sister now that she's going through her trials. Why can't they see that I've always given so much,  because it's what I've always needed.  Why do people use me for things,  then cause me to need it myself?   I don't have a me in my life. I'm feeling that old feeling,  but it's different.  I don't think I will make it this time.   I'm trying to be strong.  I'm trying to keep going.  I have children.  For the first time in almost 15 years,  I told someone how I felt.  I tried to call my ex, just to ask him how he would react if I told him I felt like I wanted to die. I have a feeling he will yell at me and tell him to leave him alone. I told one of my younger children because she walked in whilei was crying uncontrollably.  I just told her that I think I'm breaking down, and that I can't take it anymore. She told her sister.  They came up to hug me.  That helped. I don't want to bother my oldest, but I decided to send her a text telling her that I'm breaking down.  I don't know how she will react. Even before this last bout of depression hit, I dreamt I jumped off of a bridge,  and I saw my daughter asking ""she's isn't stronger yet? I'm sure she just went for a swim,  she likes long walks. ""  In the dream I thought to myself,  she knows I can't swim,  plus the water burns.   Somehow I came to the conclusion that I dreamt about Tyre Sampson, because I had that bream about 24 hours before his death.  Now, I'm not so sure. I wasn't depressed then.  Yet now here I am, just tired of going through this. I'm weaker than ever.

chrisshabani,Down the rabbit hole.,"For some background I was in a toxic relationship. I ended up kissing someone else while we weren’t talking and my now ex girlfriend found out. 

After she found out she ended things with me, and basically told me I’m a scumbag, asshole, I ruined every memory, she hates me, she was going to break up with me anyway, I’ll never find better, etc. It really hurts when someone you love says things like that and you have no answer, not even for yourself, so you absorb them and take them to heart because there’s no arguing it, they’re right. It’s been a little over a week now and I’m going back to an emotionless state of depression and one more fuck up away. This is by far the worst it’s ever been, every time I’m alone all I can think of is her and how I fucked us up. I feel like I’ve been in an endless spiral of me fucking up everything ever since I was put in this life. I just miss her so much and love her so much and can’t live with the fact that I brought this upon her. Even though it was a toxic relationship when it was good it felt like I was invincible. Everyone keeps telling me that if I was happy I wouldn’t have done it and if she didn’t push me to I wouldn’t have done it but I brush it off because that’s not an excuse. Without her I’m lost, and it destroys me that I’m the reason she’s gone and the reason she’s hurting. I don’t know what to do anymore. I always fuck up and I’m sick of it, I’m sick of hurting people, I’m sick of hurting myself. No matter how hard I try, I end up fucking up. I genuinely think there’s something wrong with me and I’m sick of struggling and making others suffer. Every time I’m alone, I go down this rabbit hole of thinking like this and trying to figure out what’s wrong with me but it just end in breakdowns, anger, sadness, and pain. There’s never an answer and I’m convinced there never will be. Im tired of eating away at myself and am so close to the edge of just giving up. 

I’m not using a throwaway here because I don’t have the energy to make one, I don’t want serious help, so please don’t call anyone or anything. If I go, I go. If I don’t, I don’t. Just please let me have peace of mind posting here without overthinking about me getting sent off or put on meds. Please just let me have that.

whatkindagone,I wish I stayed with my father.,"I wish I stayed living with my father, moving out a day before 18. I would have had the opportunity to destroy my life, to have enough courage to end my life with no ties to anything in this world. I live with a friend now, who has no idea that I'm transfem and struggling to figure out my emotions. I had a job, but that made me more or less depressed, unable to speak to people, running out of money and struggling to find a new job. I am scared, I am alone, and for years I've idealized my death for years, but nowadays it just feel worse. It feels harder than it ever has.

I feel as if I am not a valid trans woman. I'm 19, what if I'm not old enough? I've had these feelings for almost half a year, but have always wanted a feminine essence in my existence. I stayed in denial because my family has extreme hate for LGBT+, and the abuse I was suffering from my father, religious manipulation from him as well allowed me no mental space to question who I am. I barely pass, I try, but my voice is deeper than the hole I've fallen in, am a valid? Am I beautiful? Do I deserve to be called a woman? Do I deserve to be alive?

I quit my job, I've had only two altercations with my coworkers, whom all seem to like me, yet I feel nothing but uncomfortable around most of them. I can't help but feel like I am not me, 8 am not the person who belongs here. I'm not someone who is supposed to be alive. Like there's some grave error in my existence, like I was supposed to die sooner but I didn't.

If I stayed with my father, the abuse would have driven me to suicide and I would be free. But with the foolish thought that my life would get better I left. Graduated high school which I was certainly not on track for, and stayed employed for 8 long months. I have nothing to show for my existence except for confusion. I would have rather passed away.",kinda gone wish stayed living father moving day 18 would opportunity destroy life enough courage end life tie anything world live friend ha idea transfem struggling figure emotion job made le depressed unable speak people running money struggling find new job scared alone year idealized death year nowadays feel worse feel harder ever ha feel valid trans woman 19 old enough feeling almost half year always wanted feminine essence existence stayed denial family ha extreme hate lgbt abuse wa suffering father religious manipulation well allowed mental space question barely pas try voice deeper hole fallen valid beautiful deserve called woman deserve alive quit job two altercation coworkers seem like yet feel nothing uncomfortable around help feel like 8 person belongs someone supposed alive like grave error existence like wa supposed die sooner stayed father abuse would driven suicide would free foolish thought life would get better left graduated high school wa certainly track stayed employed 8 long month nothing show existence except confusion would rather passed away wish stayed father

Why can't this be easy? It already hurts enough doing this to my family. Friends knowing about it was the last thing I wanted and now I can't fucking do shit without them worrying.

mia_estridge,I wish I did it,"Somewhat recently, I almost killed myself. I was ready, I wanted to, but I didn’t. Just as I was about to get started, my s/o texted me “are you ok?” I decided I wasn’t going to respond. They’ve known I’m suicidal for a little bit now, so I guess my silence worried them. They texted me a few more times in a row, and when I didn’t respond, they called me. That made me panic even more than I already was as at that point I had the means in my hand and everything. I knew if I didn’t answer they would come over, or worse, call for help. So I figured I had a few choices. 1, answer the call and tell them everything’s fine and continue once they hung up. 2, ignore it and finish things off as quickly as possible and hope I’m dead by the time anyone can get to me. Or 3, accept that the timing just isn’t right, tell them everything’s fine, and put everything away like nothing ever happened. I ended up going with option 3, and I can’t help but wish I was impulsive enough for option 2. Or composed and motivated enough for option 1. Either way, I just wish I was gone.",mia est ridge somewhat recently almost killed wa ready wanted wa get started texted ok decided going respond known suicidal little bit guess silence worried texted time row respond called made panic even already wa point mean hand everything knew answer would come worse call help figured choice 1 answer call tell everything fine continue hung 2 ignore finish thing quickly possible hope dead time anyone get 3 accept timing right tell everything fine put everything away like nothing ever happened ended going option 3 help wish wa impulsive enough option 2 composed motivated enough option 1 either way wish wa gone wish

SuperPershing82,Sometimes I wish that rocket would have killed me,"
So I’ve been browsing this sub for a while, don’t have much to do today so I figured I might as well vent on here. I guess to introduce myself I’m currently 21 and just recently left the active-duty Army to attend college on an ROTC scholarship about 7 months ago. Prior to that, I was deployed to Afghanistan for about 10 months, it’s almost hard to even recall the person I used to be back then. I was so mentally strong and confident in myself and my purpose, ironically despite working 12 hour days seven days a week under constant threat of getting blown up I can’t remember a time when I was better off mentally like nothing in the world could stop me as I had a plan and was going to stick with it and if I did end up getting murked I was just fine with that too. I stayed pretty safe for the most part although I did have a pretty close call with a rocket that landed in a ditch on the hill below the building I worked in. It obviously scared the ever-living fuck out of me and everyone else but after like 20 minutes we were all laughing about how close that one was and how “if only the stupid guy had aimed higher, he would have got us”. The whole affair really only strengthened my resolve and made the return home that much better, getting back to the states was probably the best moment of my life even if it was right in the middle of COVID lol. 

I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to “flex” my great strength or anything I’m just trying to describe who I was then to who am I now as they aren’t even remotely the same person. Problems started to arise for me around 3 months after getting back after the novelty of being back home wore off. I started to experience this weird sense of dissociation and depressive episodes that would sometimes last for an hour to a day and then I would suddenly snap back to what I considered a “normal” state of mind. These normally entailed feelings of hopelessness and dread like something in my head just wasn’t ticking right and when it came to social situations it was like I was operating on a different frequency than everyone else like I could hear and understand them but there was no emotion behind the words. It was distracting but manageable at that point and I just chalked it up to being burned out at work and figured once I got off active duty and into college things would greatly improve. 

Fast forward to the first semester of college and unfortunately, things have not gone as I imagined. In terms of school and finances, I’m doing fine and everything is going according to plan externally but internally I seem to be slowly degrading bit by bit. The depressive episodes became more intense to the point where I would physically lock up, tighten my muscles, grind my teeth and it feels like my head is throbbing from all the negative thoughts. It is nearly impossible to sleep in this state thanks to the extreme anxiety but then I would wake up the next morning and feel fine, barely being able to remember how I felt the night before. The cycle never stopped though, and then the thoughts of “well if you just ended it this wouldn’t be a problem anymore” started to kick in and that’s when it really started to snowball downhill fast. 

At this point in time, it feels like I’m in this depressive state nearly all the time it’s only a matter of how bad it’s going to be today. The dissociative feelings have been cranked up to 11 and conversations just feel like emotionless formalities. I can no longer connect with friends and family the way I used to, like I said earlier it’s like we’re not on the same frequency if that makes any sense. The thoughts of suicide are ever-present and feel like a big red “emergency eject” button begging to be pressed. The only escape from these feelings are partying, drugs, and alcohol which are great temporarily but eventually everyone goes back to their lives, you sober up and reality slaps you in the face even harder than it did last time. I’ve also developed a very odd fear of human intimacy that I really can’t explain. For instance, I’m a virgin which is a huge insecurity of mine and pretty embarrassing I know, I always figured when I’m in college I’ll meet plenty of women so there’s no need to be insecure about it. However, I’ve had several instances where women have come onto me and I’m totally comfortable with the conversation and flirty talk but once it gets physical, even just them grabbing me it triggers this instant fear and panic response and I make up an excuse and leave in a manic state then beat myself up for the next 2 weeks about how much of a pussy I am. This is honestly one of the major contributors to my broken self-image.  

A couple of weeks ago I randomly started bawling in my car for over an hour and honestly don’t even remember why. I’m not eating much anymore maybe only like one meal a day and my cognitive performance/motivation has declined significantly. My sleep schedule is a total mess I’ll either sleep for 3 hours and wake up from nightmares in cold sweat or sleep for 14 and not want to get out of bed and face reality. What really prompted me to post this though was that last week I got really drunk and ended up putting a gun to my head without even thinking about it and then I realized what I was doing. That’s when I kind of told myself holy shit man this is real and something is very wrong with you. I need some kind of help I know but if I’m diagnosed with any kind of mental health condition, I’ll lose my scholarship and I’ve just worked too damn hard for it. I’ve openly told some of my close friends and family directly that I’m having suicidal thoughts but the response is always “oh c’mon man your way too strong for that” or “you’re just in a slump right now it’ll pass”. As much as I appreciate having people who care for me and appreciate the sentiment it doesn’t do much to alleviate anything. 

I feel like I was never meant to live this long and that that rocket was supposed to kill me that day but I’m living in some kind of an alternate reality where I survived and nothing makes sense anymore. At least then I could have died strong and confident rather than broken. I had a friend who was killed over there and honestly, I wish I could trade places with him, he deserves this life more than I do. 

Sorry, I turned this into an essay but it feels good to get this out of my head for once, if you read this long, I hope you can relate or at least get something out of it, and thank you. 

Finally, I’ll leave you with a song I’ve been listening to on repeat for the past week lmao.

I feel an immense sense of relief knowing that I'll be free of this pain in a few days. I love my parents and it cuts me up to think of how this will effect them but at the same time I hope they choke on their abusive marriage, and that the memories of what they did to me haunt them like they haunt me.  Maybe that makes me a monster who deserves to die, I truly don't know. All I know is that I've carried the pain of their dysfunction with me my entire life, and that I want it to stop.

Yam_Ancient,I dont know why I am posting this.,"
I'm not happy. On the surface I don't really look it either. I have no emotional energy to see my dying father and it hurts too much. He has a rare neurological disease that ate away his brain about 10 years ago, and he can now no longer speak   or swallow. After his attempted suicide he has no use of his legs and this has left me with unimaginable emotional pain. I'm constantly picturing what it felt like jumping from the multistorey car park down the road from me.  I warned my mother of his impending suicide when I was about 16 but she was too dumb to listen. He would ring us telling us he was gonna off himself. Show up at my college unannounced.. I told her to get the cats out of the house at least but my dad ended up killing them. For someone who loves cats it haunts me to this day... 

He would lash out at me and my brother when angry. It started with slaps when we were bad. I think I turned into a bad teenager and I started talking back to him. I phoned the police a few times...I would barricade myself in the room to avoid being hit. It was starting to get worse and it wasn't helped by the fact I talked back. The last time nefore we moved to my grandma's He broke my nose. He went after my mum and I said stop qnd he straight up punched me. Blood was everywhere. I am very sensitive and this has traumatised me. But nit as much as his suicide. I literally can't face him now that he can't speak. He can emote just about but he's stuck in his own body. It hurts even more knowing that he loves us. I wish he didn't because I didn't visit for 3 years at one point. I was told that he would stare at a picture of me and my brother all day. 

Janice who is my dad's sister has never failed to voice her disappointment at myself and my brother. I remember qfter my dad's first suicide attempt she was having a go at my mum. I went sick at her. Said some nasty things. She thinks that I should have got over what happened since I am an adult now. She just calls me out on everything. I just want someone's support. I feel torn apart. 

I want to live my life now qfter years of pain. My brother never arranges to see him. My mum has cut him out for good. I cant understand this and I know this is hypocritical. 

I am given a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. I could show symptoms the same time as my father or possibly earlier because the gene is more aggressive when passed from a male. I'm terrified however I have accepted my fate. I will shoot myself before I even get too bad. 

It sickens me to imagine my father laying there in pain with no way of expressing it. He literally sits there for hours stuck in his own body. I want to shoot him to put him out of his misery and then shoot myself. 

I am socially anxious qt work and I can't make friends. I went through a period of depression in school and got brain fog. This brain fog never left me. I cant link the trauma with the brain fog because I'm smart enough to know that not everything works like that. I lost my friends because I was so fucking weird and hostile. Now I don't trust other women and I act fucking weird around them because I don't want them to know the real me. In truth, I just want a friend. But myself is not good enough right now. 

I have my boyfriend but I'm not sure if he's right for me. He's a year older than me and we work together. He has been excellent at offering me support when needed however his actions have showed another story in the past. He gets very argumentative and I am really suspicious that he is a manipulative bad person holding me back in life. But I love him and I wouldn't have made it without his support. I also know that I could be wrong. I am so unsure about everything. He accuses me of getting too close to other men at work. And to be more aware of my surroundings etc. I could just be overthinking it 

I mean it when I say that I definitely have emotionally abusive qualities so I definitely can't tell if I am the problems or he is. 

The prospect of potentially having an alzheimers- like disease in my mid 30s is literally shitting on my progress in life. I was a talented child and now I am working in a crap warehouse slaving myself away. 

I have no sense of humour. Everything said to me I take too seriously. I am insanely sensitive to the point where I have left jobs over a minor disagreement. I do not think that it would take alot to push me over the edge. 

My body is ugly. My face is ugly. I spend 3 hours getting ready for work every day and I slap so much makeup on that I'm unrecognisable. I get attention when I do myself up but I got bullied in school when I wore no makeup. Go figure. 

I want a fulfilling life but I don't see any hope. I just crave love and friendship. I have done some bad things in my life and I am no angel. I feel about 35 when I am 24. 

I dont know where the fuck to go from here. 

I dont want my boyfriend to suffer when I chose to end my life. He wouldn't be able to handle what my mum and dad went through. He's got his own emotional baggage. 

I dont want to insult anyone on here because I know there are people going through FAR worse than me. I just know how sensitive I am and that my father's death is near. I will have to see him, plan a funeral with family members that hate me. I hope someone will have the energy to read this and guide me. There's alot more trauma to the story but my life is a blur, alot like what I have been writing about. 

Please excuse my lack of good grammar, I am tired after night shift and I can't be bothered to spellcheck. I have never put my story out there before. 

I cant afford counselling and to be honest I don't know if they can even help me.",yam ancient happy surface really look either emotional energy see dying father hurt much ha rare neurological disease ate away brain 10 year ago longer speak swallow attempted suicide ha use leg ha left unimaginable emotional pain constantly picturing felt like jumping multistorey car park road warned mother impending suicide wa 16 wa dumb listen would ring u telling u wa gonna show college unannounced told get cat house least dad ended killing someone love cat haunt day would lash brother angry started slap bad think turned bad teenager started talking back phoned police time would barricade room avoid hit wa starting get worse helped fact talked back last time nefore moved grandma broke nose went mum said stop qnd straight punched blood wa everywhere sensitive ha traumatised nit much suicide literally face speak emote stuck body hurt even knowing love u wish visit 3 year one point wa told would stare picture brother day janice dad sister ha never failed voice disappointment brother remember qfter dad first suicide attempt wa go mum went sick said nasty thing think got happened since adult call everything want someone support feel torn apart want live life qfter year pain brother never arranges see mum ha cut good cant understand know hypocritical given 50 50 chance inheriting disease could show symptom time father possibly earlier gene aggressive passed male terrified however accepted fate shoot even get bad sickens imagine father laying pain way expressing literally sits hour stuck body want shoot put misery shoot socially anxious qt work make friend went period depression school got brain fog brain fog never left cant link trauma brain fog smart enough know everything work like lost friend wa fucking weird hostile trust woman act fucking weird around want know real truth want friend good enough right boyfriend sure right year older work together ha excellent offering support needed however action showed another story past get argumentative really suspicious manipulative bad person holding back life love made without support also know could wrong unsure everything accuses getting close men work aware surroundings etc could overthinking mean say definitely emotionally abusive quality definitely tell problem prospect potentially alzheimers like disease mid 30 literally shitting progress life wa talented child working crap warehouse slaving away sense humour everything said take seriously insanely sensitive point left job minor disagreement think would take alot push edge body ugly face ugly spend 3 hour getting ready work every day slap much makeup unrecognisable get attention got bullied school wore makeup go figure want fulfilling life see hope crave love friendship done bad thing life angel feel 35 24 dont know fuck go dont want boyfriend suffer chose end life able handle mum dad went got emotional baggage dont want insult anyone know people going far worse know sensitive father death near see plan funeral family member hate hope someone energy read guide alot trauma story life blur alot like writing please excuse lack good grammar tired night shift bothered spellcheck never put story cant afford counselling honest know even help dont know posting

Most of my money goes to my parents while the rest supplies some impulsive fast-food or drugs. I love my family and would kill for them, but I am so tired. I've lost nearly all of my intelligence...nearly to the point of having short-term memory loss. I have panic attacks that cause me to sweat and struggle to breath.

Decent-Pick-5620,Failure at my career; have somehow become a loser; no one would even notice for days,"For those of you who have been suicidal, have you thought of ways to maybe make it less painful for your siblings and family? I have a mom who i know worries about me but because I'm a failure at my career I know I can't take care of her. And my sister is a junior in highschool and sometimes i worry about her mental health. She finally made friends so i think shes happy now, but i worry my ending myself would push her over the edge too. My other sister is in grad school. Shed probably be fine, though she would be sad for a few months i think. The friends i used to be close with would be very sad for a few months, but they would all get over it within a few months or a year so really i just want to know what can i do to make it easier on my mom and kid sister? I looked into life insurance, but apparently that won't pay out if i kill myself. Im thinking I can just record them a bunch of videos and leave them lots of writing? Anything else you wish your friend or brother had left behind for you?  


I have a really great boss and ik she'll be sad but honestly idc. the work is too hard for me and i have no motivation to do it. i just wish i could do my artform and be free of this corporate hell. but without the corporate hell i cant date, i cant socialize, i cant help support my mom and sister, i cant pay bills or eat. I just dont see a way out of the feelings of financial doom, loneliness, and sadness i always feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I have battled every day since I was 11, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, self worth.. I haven't self harmed in a year or so, which is the longest I've gone for any point of my conscious life. The only thing that's ever stopped me was having to use my body for work, but I'd cope in other ways, alcohol, drugs, whatever I could do to get me through. 

I am older now, I consider myself out of the industry, though I am doing outcalls rather than working at a brothel, I'd still be working there if I was allowed to tbh(covid work restrictions), but in a way I'm glad I can't. I am finding it harder and harder to live with the memories of what my life has been, all the cruel things that have been said and done. And having absolutely nobody to confide in, nobody I can trust, it's an incredibly lonely life.

I wish I had been smarter with my money, but when you're living that lifestyle time feels infinite, it feels like it will last forever, and you spend stupid amount of money on nothing because you know you'll make it back in 5 minutes. I so badly wish I'd been smarter, set myself up for my future, but now I have nothing, other than the memories, regrets. I did it all for nothing.

I feel like no matter how hard I work to find happiness, I just can't. I feel like I will never be able to let go of all the things that hurt, even though all I want is to be able to move on. Now I'm pregnant, and I'm so ashamed and am going to have to face doctors appointments, scans, the abortion, alone. Alone. When I imagine any another woman in that situation my heart breaks at the thought of her, my heart breaks for myself. I am so scared, and I am feeling the full gravity of how alone I truly am. 

I just want peace, I don't know how I can continue to exist, it feels impossible. I am overwhelmed, sure, but like all of us there is so much that I am not writing down, it's not as simple as find some support etc, there's so many complex situations I have tried tirelessly to navigate through and let go of, and I can't do it.

Brilliant-Trifle8322,I hate being a human,"I've had depression for about as long as I can remember. There's been periods where things have been okay, periods where I feel I'm in a bottomless pit with zero options to help myself. I'm sure you get the gist of it. 

I think I've finally realised the core of my issues, and that is, I deeply despise being human.

I hate how I feel such a strong desire to have connections with others, how I know when I'm being stupid or irrational but seem to have no control over myself. Hate how our society is structured and actively seems to harm human health, physically and mentally. Hate how I can't just shut my mind off, how I need constant stimulation. 

How we have the desire for material objects, power, love. How we constantly hurt each other over the most pathetic things. How how we destroy the environment to create our own.

We as humans seem to be constantly reassuring ourselves that our existence is not absurd, to the point we invent stories and religions to put some meaning into why we exist. How we justify ourselves, how we shape our self image based on external factors, how we spit out useless self serving platitudes to those on the brink and pat ourselves on the back for it. The truth is, existence inherently has no meaning, it's a subjective concept our fucked up ape brains came up with, and the lengths some people will go to to ensure we do is honestly disgusting. But that too is human nature.

Obviously there's no fixing my species, and most other mammals seem to suffer the same or similar conditions anyway, just on a baser level. Maybe existence itself just isn't for me.",brilliant trifle 8322 depression long remember period thing okay period feel bottomless pit zero option help sure get gist think finally realised core issue deeply despise human hate feel strong desire connection others know stupid irrational seem control hate society structured actively seems harm human health physically mentally hate shut mind need constant stimulation desire material object power love constantly hurt pathetic thing destroy environment create human seem constantly reassuring existence absurd point invent story religion put meaning exist justify shape self image based external factor spit useless self serving platitude brink pat back truth existence inherently ha meaning subjective concept fucked ape brain came length people go ensure honestly disgusting human nature obviously fixing specie mammal seem suffer similar condition anyway baser level maybe existence hate human
