,SuicideWatch,"I’ve posted here before in my previous attempts, and luckily, I made it out safe, know that I do want to at least try to live beyond 30. That still doesn’t stop my mind from going there often.

This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. 

Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. 

My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.  And there’s the fact that a grandchild from my brother is coming, and I can’t help but think this is the sign. This is the chance for me to talk my leave. But I understand that just offing myself is going to hurt my family and one friend so much.

So here’s where I’m at: i have a half-thought out plan. I REALLY DON’T want to die, but the mental pain is so unbearable i don’t know how to control. Telling my family and friend about this is only going to make me feel guilty/worse. I work as a para at a high school in Texas and have maybe one sick day left. I’m waiting till my contract is out and then I’ll formally quit and look for other opportunities. 

I’m considering going to a mental hospital to check myself in so I don’t actually go through it. Would I be fired if they found out/have to tell them if I stay there for longer than expected? How does it usually go when checking yourself in for suicidal thoughts from anyone’s experience (from TX would really help)? Researching has only given me vague answers and I don’t know if I’ll just lose my job/paycheck because I’m scared. How do I even tell my mom that I’m driving myself to a clinic because I’m scared I might run off and die without giving her a panic attack? 

I’m waiting till a few hours from now to decide my next action. Maybe these thoughts will go away by them, but future reference may help me later if it ever comes up again.

&lt;p&gt;This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, thanks for reading. I know this is not an advice sub but I desperately need some from a stranger. Any really.

(post below)

Not sure if I was sexually coerced abroad (19m), think I have an STD - may have passed it onto my girlfriend (20). Please help.

I’ll just start with the fact that this is probably the most difficult thing that has happened to me in my life. I have had nightmares for two weeks since the event and I can’t get any sleep; my daylight hours are consumed with guilt and I am seriously considering suicide. (Have written a note, and made a rough timeframe).

I was recently on holiday in Havana, and was searching for food alone around 1am, very intoxicated. For those who know Havana - there is a street where prostitutes hang out, unfortunately its one of the only places you can get a pizza that late. Here is where it gets blurry - I remember walking back to my apartment and being approached by three prostitutes. They brought me to someones bed (not mine) where i remember receiving fellatio (cant remember if there was a condom). I remember having an erection but being unable to finish. I barely remember getting home, but I still had my phone and wallet but when I checked in the morning my wallet was missing all its cash (around 60 euros).

I’m not sure it was not consensual. I did not report the event to police because i’m not sure 1) they would do anything 2) I have desperately tried to forget it ever happened. I love my girlfriend more than anyone in the world and tried to forget it happened but I cannot. She means so much to me and I’d never thought of cheating before but I just can’t remember my thought process no matter how many times I relive it. I’m so scared that I consented. I know that I’m responsible for the actions of drunk me.

Recently my testicles have started itching more than usual and sometimes it stings slightly to pee (no redness). I have had sex with my girlfriend within the time I got back (with a condom vaginally, but not orally) as I didn’t want her to know what happened and think I cheated. I feel really really awful knowing that I could have passed this disease on to her and all I want is for her to be alright. To me suicide seems like the only plausible way out, as I can’t see myself living life without her and this will undoubtedly fundamentally change how she sees me.

,SuicideWatch,"Like a lot of you, I'm very lonely. 

Lonely enough that, lately, I've been taking walks to try and get my mind off things a bit. It's helping a little, and getting out there and just walking for miles and miles has been something to look forward to now for the first time in a long time. 

Thing is, there's a bridge that I like to stop at and rest. Every time I walk into it, and I stop, and I look down, I think about how easy it would be to just jump off into the water and be done with it all. It's high enough that it would definitely kill me. 

This morning, right as the sun was first starting to peek out, I started off on my walk. When I got to the bridge, I stopped for way too long - an hour maybe. After a while, it went from ""Maybe it might be okay"", to ""I'm sure it wouldn't be that bad"", to ""It would be over before you knew what hit you"". 

Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I'm getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. 

I've been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. 

I'm finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. 

I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. 

Now, as I write all this down, and I'm getting progressively more drunk, I'm getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, _really_ good inside.",t2_id929kuo,False,,0,False,I'm starting to be less and less scared that I'm not scared at all,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_tt4jt5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648746652.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of you, I&amp;#39;m very lonely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, right as the sun was first starting to peek out, I started off on my walk. When I got to the bridge, I stopped for way too long - an hour maybe. After a while, it went from &amp;quot;Maybe it might be okay&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure it wouldn&amp;#39;t be that bad&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;It would be over before you knew what hit you&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I&amp;#39;m getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I write all this down, and I&amp;#39;m getting progressively more drunk, I&amp;#39;m getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good inside.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"TW: // h*mophobia, mention of getting st@bbed.

I'm just going through really hard time. I don't even know what to say about it. 

But yesterday i felt really suicidal. I never felt this much of suicidal before. 

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD-C, and everything made sense in life. But my parents are still not understanding about how mentally tolling it can be. I told my parents that have been feeling burnout for past 9 months and they just seem to take it lightly. I was in depression, and always had chronic anxiety issues which were all fueled by my untreated and undetected ADHD for all these years. 

My parents are actually really nice and always encourage me to open up, but it's all stupid because they end up blaming me for not trying harder. My anxiety which I had since I was kid always made it difficult for me to have friends. I do not even have siblings to share stuff with. 

I cannot share or talk about my problems that are actually troubling me to my parents with complete honesty because they don't understand and end up telling me to fix my schedule or some stupid shit that definitely wouldn't work for adhd minds. 
Because of that i atleast try to gain comfort from them by talking about other stuff that gives me pleasure like talking about favourite serie or charecter, but they ALWAYS tell me that I'm getting distracted again, and that should delete my Social media and stuff. 

Also yesterday, i asked my mom if, she  would accompany to pride parade if that happened in our city. And she started nagging, ""i told you to delete Instagram, you are supposed to study,.... Delete that rn!"" which clearly shows that she was trying to avoid that talk. So I'm really not left with a space where can talk about anything comfortably with them. The fact that she is internally h*mophobic puts me through so much stress. And everytime I talk about something deep, it always ends up with her telling me to study. I teared up. My dad, is mostly unavailable at home because of his work, all we do is little chit chat. And never had a chance to talk deeply about my personal issues, like i can do with my mom (who's housewife) even tho that doesn't end up well. 

Since I took an academic gap year, all my friends already promoted to next year's classes, left city and i have completely lost contact with them. Its been two years since i haven't really went outside to fresh my mind and enjoy myself. I can't do that, because my parents don't allow me to go anywhere alone and I don't even have a valid reason to.

Also I'm realising that even tho my parents have been always nice to me, they are always restricting my freedom. I'm F18 for godsake, and i still don't have control over my decisions. They are mostly made on my behalf by my mom. I can't even recharge my Mobile plans, i have to ask my mom every time to do it. And she would always excuse that ""it's waste of money use wifi instead"" and say ""you don't call or get calls from your friends anyway"". Like, sure wifi works but that'd mean i can't really go outside since i struggle with anxiety and always need music to cope. I don't even know details of my own band acc or cards, and so I can't do something on my own without asking my parents about it. This all might sound ridiculous but i really don't know any other way to cope. 


And so my coping options were reduced to my alone time in my room which helps me organise my intrusive thoughts, nice people on instagram, reddit forums and music. 


But yesterday, these all were breached. My parents are not emotionally supportive, unsafe to confide in and almost indifferent to my ADHD situation even tho they atleast provide with meds. I'm not on therapys. I do not have friends. My mom's homophobic undertone when i tried to seek least bit of comfort is just so hurtful. The wifi wasn't working well and my mom refused to recharge my phone, which meant no music, reddit or Instagram which gives me best comfort space i can afford.  And my parents intruded in my personal space yesterday which is crucial to me especially when i feel unstable and wanted to write my thoughts down privately. 

I went to bathroom and cried. And next thing that came to my mind was to go upstairs on terrace and then kiss the ground. Right before when i slept at 4:45am (i have very shitty sleep schedule bec of my adhd) i saw a flash in head where someone st@bbed me in my stomach and then hugged me, and i felt great and said ""thank you, this feels awesome"". I was kinda horrified and mad at myself for having such stupid intrusive thought. I woke up late today at 11am,  and was veryy tired and felt like i would collapse any second. Slept for another 2½ hours and saw a dream where i told my mom to kill me. And then she got mad at me for always talking about negetive stuff. I woke up feeling half dead. 

So yeah this all happened. And- idek where am I supposed to go.. .

I subconsciously keep hoping to die of natural causes or somehow go into vegetative state.

And my parents intruded in my personal space yesterday which is crucial to me especially when i feel unstable and wanted to write my thoughts down privately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to bathroom and cried. And next thing that came to my mind was to go upstairs on terrace and then kiss the ground. Right before when i slept at 4:45am (i have very shitty sleep schedule bec of my adhd) i saw a flash in head where someone st@bbed me in my stomach and then hugged me, and i felt great and said &amp;quot;thank you, this feels awesome&amp;quot;. I was kinda horrified and mad at myself for having such stupid intrusive thought. I woke up late today at 11am,  and was veryy tired and felt like i would collapse any second. Slept for another 2½ hours and saw a dream where i told my mom to kill me. And then she got mad at me for always talking about negetive stuff. I woke up feeling half dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah this all happened. And- idek where am I supposed to go.. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I subconsciously keep hoping to die of natural causes or somehow go into vegetative state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of my problems would have been solved if i didn&amp;#39;t have ADHD. Having no true safe space makes living just even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

I also got kicked out of college, no way I can turn back.



I've been a burden to my mother and my father. I've infected them with my depression they were unable to heal. I know my death my hurt them, but it will be better for them in the long run. Just like pouring alcohol on an infected wound, it will hurt really badly first, but it will heal it in the long run.


I have no friends left, I've tried for 4 years, only one. And she was more than I could ever ask. But she's gone, because I fucked up. I squeezed her to the point that she left, I don't blame her. I loved her, she was my best friend. And she was the first and only person to say that to me, ""I love you bestie"". Now, she blocked me, she was my last thing I tried living for. She's gone. I have her all I had, and she gave me what I want, what I needed. Now, she's gone. If you see this BB, it's not your fault. Please don't blame my disappeance or death on yourself. It isn't, you held me together, like you held me in your arms a few days ago before you left. You were the best thing that happened to me, and those best memories that I've had with you will be the last thing I will remember before my death. Though I'm not sure if you still love me after what I did, I still did.


Today was the first time I felt grief. I thought I did before, but, the pain I felt today, was nothing like anything I felt. Felt worse than waking up after my surgery after the anesthesia technician forgot to give me morphine. It felt worse than when the needle hit my nerve during a blood draw.
I felt the true meaning of a heart break. I thought it was a metaphor, or an exaggeration. But, it wasn't. I felt the grief in my chest, my breaths felt empty. My heartbeat felt unreal. The pain, the chest pain when I was crying. I didn't know that could happen.


I've decided to go missing today, run away from my parents, find a hotel far away spend my last days drinking and eating my favourite food, then finding erernal peace.


I appreciate if you want to convince me otherwise, but I've already decided. I don't want anything better, I just want my friend back, and maybe build my life. But, that's impossible. I've tried therapy, medications, groups, suicide lines. Nothing can fix it.

If you want to help. I'd love if someone could comfort me through my last days here, I always felt scared being alone. Id prefer if I didn't die lonely. Someone I could talk about my happiest memories, my biggest regrets. My deepest secrets. I plan on dying on Monday, if not anything early if they find me.

I think I fought bravely. I endured unimaginable hardships. But sadly it wasn't enough. There is nothing to run or fight from. And nothing to surrender to. So, it's best I cease.

Turns out, I was living with my head in the sand for my entire life. There's so much here for me, but I'm far too weak to embrace it all. I'm not equipped to live this life. My mind is trapped in a body that can't allow me to achieve my meaning, a body that taunts me with what I could've had if I wasn't me, a body that has caused me increasingly unbearable levels of despair and grief that has left me completely broken, and I'm not able to live like this anymore. There's no peace of mind on any of my living days anymore. It used to come and go, but for the past months, it has consumed me. I have fear, pain, tears, and I can't hide them anymore. I used to think that everything passes with time, and I found great comfort in that, but I just can't see that anymore for myself. I thought my road was going to be an indefinite rollercoaster, and if you asked me even a year ago if I would come to the end of my road on my own terms, I would've never believed you, and yet here I am. This is it for me. This is where I get off. My road over the past months has slowly and gradually become rougher, coarser, bumpier - it's not paved anymore, it's dust. There is no road ahead of me that I can see anymore, just a diminished line of dirt that vaguely resembles a trailing off into the distance. So, this is my goodbye, to anyone who cares. I was never going to be okay in this life.

Now call me a hypocrite, but...

Just want anyone who sees this to know that everything will work out. You've got your beautiful selves and a world to love others. The hardest part of everything will be over in the end. Everything passes with time, but you'll always remember the good things, and you'll be so much richer in your soul for having experienced them. The wonderful things will always remain. Be strong, be kind to yourself, be kind to those around you, and live the best life you can live while you're here on this gentle planet.

Maybe I'll cross paths with some of you beautiful people out there in my next life...

I thought my road was going to be an indefinite rollercoaster, and if you asked me even a year ago if I would come to the end of my road on my own terms, I would&amp;#39;ve never believed you, and yet here I am. This is it for me. This is where I get off. My road over the past months has slowly and gradually become rougher, coarser, bumpier - it&amp;#39;s not paved anymore, it&amp;#39;s dust. There is no road ahead of me that I can see anymore, just a diminished line of dirt that vaguely resembles a trailing off into the distance. So, this is my goodbye, to anyone who cares. I was never going to be okay in this life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now call me a hypocrite, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just want anyone who sees this to know that everything will work out. You&amp;#39;ve got your beautiful selves and a world to love others. The hardest part of everything will be over in the end. Everything passes with time, but you&amp;#39;ll always remember the good things, and you&amp;#39;ll be so much richer in your soul for having experienced them. The wonderful things will always remain. Be strong, be kind to yourself, be kind to those around you, and live the best life you can live while you&amp;#39;re here on this gentle planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ll cross paths with some of you beautiful people out there in my next life... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;d certainly put the biggest smile on my face, and that I will never doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Dear reddit users,

I just want to say thankyou for helping me today, ive been really stupid and was planning on ending my life, even going as far as to enquire on r/heroin about how much I'd need for an overdose. Kind of ironic to be born into this world on such a drug only to leave on the same thing.

But after speaking with people there, here and my partner in Hungary. Something in me changed, I realized that all of this internalised pain and suffering. Was keeping me from progressing forward, while that sounds like a no-brainer. At the time it didn't quite register, that said this isn't what changed my mind.

Ive been quite irritable with my partner lately and have been pretty nasty and awful towards her, it was this coupled with the fact that I just need to keep busy and maybe have a hobby that finally made me see sense. Yes im still facing the same problems as before, the same fears and the same struggles. But now im ready to face them instead of running away.

im so cripplingly lonely. i went to go visit my family for a couple weeks and got to feel real love and care for me from my family. it felt so weird being hugged and talked to. now im back in this neglectful prison where i just sit here to rot. 

ive started cutting and ive been hitting myself on the head a lot. i spend all day just wracked with sobs for days on end. i hate myself so much. 

ive been ill all my life and i cant take it anymore. its ruined me beyond repair. i was abused badly as a kid and it took away any ability to lead a normal life. I hate who i am. 

i ruined my relationship with my ex and best friend of 7 years because i was terrified she'd abandon me like i always was. i hurt her so much. i will never forgive myself for that. I never meant to hurt her and i care about her so deeply. she meant to world to me and still does but i fucked it up. i love her so so much and want it to go back to normal but shes moved on. 

she treats me like im nothing now nd doesn't even want to see me. i miss when she was excited to talk to me and we were happy. i miss her so much even though i talk to her everyday. it doesnt feel like im talking to her it feels like im talking to a stranger. 

i want her to take me back so bad, doesn't even have to be romantically i just want to talk to my best friend again. 

i love her so much still and im so confused and hurt. im trying so hard to keep our friendship together but shes going to get tired eventually and then ill really be alone. 

my friends dont respond to me, they dont text me first, dont want to do anything with me. i get left on read asking to do things. none of them are irl by the way, i havent had a friend irl in years. 

i feel like a zoo animal pacing its cage. i cant take it anymore. i want to numb it all so bad but i cant. my post makes it sound like my only issue here is loneliness but it isnt, ive had to deal with such a crushing amount of issues my whole life but the loneliness is whats finally doing me in. 

I feel like i cant be alone or im going to finally do it. 

i just want somebody to hold me and tell me itll be okay. i want this all to end. i want to go back to my good family and feel like i have any presence at all to anyone. i want my dad to hug me and to tell him everything and to finally be at peace. i cant be left alone anymore. 

i dont know if i want to die. thats better than having a plan though. I first attempted at 10, again at 13. i just want to numb it all but i cant. i want to bash my head in because thats the only way i can stop this. whenever i get like this all i want to do is hit my head until it stops and sometimes thats what i do

My parents are disappointed with me lazing around, but what the hell? I've never asked to be born. I would have been gone long time ago but I don't have the courage to find out whether hell is real.  

My mom talks about how people make mistakes. But I am the one who has to carry on life with the trauma she inflicted on me for the rest of my life.

Constantly hit as a form of punishment for my mistakes when I was only a toddler &amp; in elementary and would get humiliated by being scolded in public. 

In short, I never received any form of understanding for what I went through from my parents &amp; now my mom is saying that I need to stop victimizing myself because she went through worse being born as an unplanned child &amp; was neglected &amp; by her mother. Well, what the fuck though? Why... why did someone like my mom, who will probably never get proper treatment decided to have children? Fuck you, mom. Fuck you. 

Now my mom has been lecturing me of how my teachers have told her I have no drive &amp; passion in school. Well, what the hell do you expect to come out though from complaining about that? I don't understand. It's just so draining to work so hard for something I don't even care about. It doesn't help that my mom would nag about how she had the best scores in university but is currently only a housewife married to someone who had parents who treated her terribly. What a miserable life despite all the hard work.

My self esteem issues are honestly so bad, they were even worse when I was younger. I would constantly stutter &amp; would eat my lunch in the toilet during lunch times in fear of having to interact with other people. It did not help that there was this one jerk who once chased after me and aimed his water bottle on my head for something I didn't even do. My grades that time were even worse, and people gave up on me for being stupid. That was also the reason why so many people avoided me so I was lonely for a very long time.

Honestly, I'm just feeling horrible right now, crying about how my life is going to start going downhill after I graduate. My parents (my mom in particular) is constantly complaining about how I'm not trying hard (I'm not denying that) &amp; how life will be harder, that I'm too relaxed for someone who hasn't been trying hard enough to apply to universities. But what is the point when my parents don't really support me in my own choices? I don't feel like I have control over my own life anyway. I'm not allowed to go out of my shitty developing country to take majors I actually would actually care about.

I'm honestly trying to aim being ""forced"" in a gap year to reflect in my life.

Sorry for the long post and I’m kind of new to this so I don’t know how to do the whole TL;DR thing, I’m sorry. 

Btw I know I’ve posted this a bunch of times and this will be the last. The reason I’m posting this more recently was that I was ashamed to admit that I started doing this again but then realized my career choice, so yea sorry for the multiple posts. 

Ok, first of all, I know that this isn’t an excuse or anything but because of the pandemic, online learning, and other stuff, I just kind of got bored and lonely and I guess I just started going on Reddit looking for something fun and found these NSFW SubReddits and people messaging me, I don’t know honestly, I was just bored and lonely. I never had any friends in school (and still don’t and get bullied quite often and never stand up for myself) because I’m shy and just overall weird and different from other people (bisexual even though no one knows I just feel different that I like men and women), and I absolutely hate my parents, we don’t agree on anything ever, they’re always in my space, constantly putting pressure on me, and I hate when they say racist and homophobic things (and I can’t stand up for myself because all of a sudden I have no voice and an attitude problem). I understand that they want me to do good in school and life but I just, I just can’t stand them. So basically what I did was I started talking to these people on Reddit, lying to them about basically everything (Age, sex, etc)  (I never gave any of my personal info btw) and what I feel the most shittiest about is that I sometimes received pics and sent pictures of other people from other SubReddits and said they were mine. I realized that what I was doing was wrong and really disgusting, so I got rid of that account, but a couple months ago I found what I wanted to be in life and when I grow up and that is a FBI Special Agent (I know I have to get US citizenship and denounce my Canadian one, and I’m aware of the other requirements), but I feel like I did something illegal, and I’ve also heard they ask that question in the polygraph. I also feel like I’ve ruined everyone that I talked to lives as well by lying to them that I’m an adult when I’m younger than 18. I’m afraid this will affect my future and career aspiration. I have deleted everything, but still, I just, can’t live with myself. At night I just think that if I end it, my family would have less of a burden, I don’t have to think about this, and I can start over.

,SuicideWatch,"My siblings have always been jerks to me even as children, they would gang up on me and insult me as a group and when I try to confront them they just laugh it off… My father has always stopped them whenever things get serious. My dad passed away 2 years ago and the bullying has gotten more serious and more constant, everyday they insult me make rude insensitive jokes about me.

My older sister is 20 years old but she acts like a 13 year old child I bet even 13 year olds nowadays are far more mature than her. She stole around 700+ CAD from my mom and also stole her jewelry and clothes. She also steals from our neighbours, She steals for the fun of stealing not because she needs anything, she always insults me, she calls me useless etc and she always says that i was mixed up from birth just because my skin is darker than hers and my brothers.

My brother 18 years old is just like my sister but worse. He calls me a men toucher on a daily basis he also says I watch cp when I obviously don’t……..
He’s a high school drop out and he is also jobless and he is obese… not only is he jobless he always steals money from my mom and he makes her cry every night. He used my moms debit card without her permission to buy a 800$+ phone… not only did he do those things without apologizing he takes my mom car at night like 2 am and comes back at 7 and that gets my mom really stressed she can’t even sleep at night without fearing that her money or car would get taken, one day he left without my moms permission with her car and guess what he crashed my moms 9k$ car and now he’s demanding her to buy a new one…… He went out of the city with a G3 license and now he got his license suspended and now my mom has to pay 4 grand just to get it back, he’s not even working to fix his mistake. 

He and my sister are incredibly passive aggressive even when I’m not even in the same room as them they insult me, they talk out loud without a care in the world so I could easily hair them, they even backbite constantly they always say I’m garbage I’m useless I’m this and I’m that and I’m tired of it all I’m tired of the constant bullying I’m tired of them always trying to make me the bad guy….

I’m just a 15 year old Male trying to focus on my studies and life but their constant bullying makes it incredibly hard for me to just live normally I have contemplated suicide multiple times but I can’t even do that because in my religion (Islam) suicide is a really serious major sin, I just want them to stop bullying me constantly I just want to live a decent life…… I’m just tired of it all.

If anybodies asking about my mom well she works a 11 To 8 PM job so she can’t really help me from the bullying but whenever she is home she helps but she’s a diabetic 40 year old that’s struggling to even walk properly so I don’t want to stress her anymore because of my suicidal thoughts..

My older brother drops me off at school and he picks me up a hour or 2 when school ends and what makes it difficult is that he forces me to walk to a bank or kfc for no reason whatsoever, when he picks me up with my sister he just becomes a complete jerk he wouldn’t let me enter the car that day I was so pissed I just gave up and walked 1 hour+ home and my mom was at work and there was nothing she could do.

,SuicideWatch,"So ive been trying to get help for years, its too long of a story to go into. But to give you an idea of how apathetic and incompetent the mental health services are in my area, the last contact I had was my GP (over the phone) who told me...

""You don't sound like your depressed""

Despite me exhibiting all the signs, which for me are;

-Im bed all the time, zero energy to do anything
-Trouble sleeping/eating
-Frequent thoughts/feelings of hopelessness
-Short term memory loss

Only a month ago I was taken to hospital and assesed by a mental health professional, I told them that im planning to take my life by means of overdose. But no follow up or treatment was given, although to be honest...after three years of being left unchecked and untreated, going round and round in circles with professionals who make excuses as to why they can't help you. Id had enough.

Two years ago I lost my best friend to suicide, she was in the room next to me as she was overdosing. There was nothing I could do to stop her. Five days following her being put on life support, she died. She was someone who once talked me off the ledge, but she still took her life. Now I want to do the same. As a Trans-woman, I constantly feel like the world hates me. Like they see me as a parisite or something thats subhuman.

More and more people are starting to see people like me as degenerate, but all I wanted to do was live my life. I don't impose my choices onto others, nor demand anyone use my pronouns. I have my own rules but expect no one else to live by them, its a really peaceful way to be. If we all lived like this, the world would be just as peaceful too. On the subject of peace, let me tell you about mine.

Anytime I've decided (truly decided) to go ahead with making preparations to end my life, an overwhelming sense of serenity and peace washes over me. Its the happiest feeling ive had since I was 6 years old and im 32 now. People have told me time after time to get help, and trust me ive really tried. The sad reality is, the mental health services in my area are under funded, under staffed and can only treat those most in need.

That being said many whom I've met have no emotional understanding of you, some of them are even downright abusive towards you. And can I prove it? No. And that's how they get away with this. Needless to say, im not looking for help. I simply came here to tell you how I feel. Because id rather have 6 months to a few years happiness than 3 more decades of misery. 

But suicide is no easy task, especially for those who I'm about to hurt. That being said, the human heart has an amazing capacity to heal, my friends and what little family I have left will heal with time. They will move on and find a way to live with what I did, that's just how human beings are.

I'm sorry this post was morbid, in a way I feel better for saying it. But I want you to bear something in mind before attempting to talk me down. In a recent episode of Doctor who aired in 2020. The Doctor asks the master...

I  was about to end my life and no idea why I didn't pull the trigger. 3  nights ago, I got drunk off my rear end. had a gun to my head and should  have pulled the trigger but didn't. just sat there shaking and bawling  to no end for hours.

I struggle  with C-PTSD, Severe Chronic Depression, Severe social anxiety, Paranoia,  adhd, minor brain damage and tons of other issues.

I  am 41, on disability, SSI to be exact got into streaming games online  for extra money but was told by SSI they consider it work and if I keep  pushing it, I will lose my SSI even though I don't make that much if  anything at all doing it.

I am  being sued by the housing authority for the apartments we live in for  mistakes that the landlords and managers made years ago and the housing  authority don't care. I rent a bedroom from my aunt and her son who  treat me horribly and abuse me and take advantage of me.

I  have 3 credit cards all 3 over the balance of 500 dollars. I am in a  total debt of 9.6k because of the 9k I am being sued for and the 500  plus on each credit card.

I bought a car a few years ago that was supposed to help me change my life only for the fact that I got scammed.

I  am also physically disabled now due to having arthritis and rheumatoid  arthritis in my lower back, knees, feet. meds sometimes don't help and  working out doesn't help one bit either.

I  have spent 10 years homeless and have had a family that severely  neglected me from the age of 5 and up. lost both parents in my early  20's. have no siblings or other family but my aunt and her son who treat  me horrible.

I have tried for the  past 10 years to get my own apartment based on income, find a room to  rent I could afford,, get a minivan to live in, to find a job I could  even online. but to no avail, only to get let down, rejected, mocked at,  made fun of etc. I am now in my 40's and all the work I have done in my  early 20's and 30's were just day labor cash under the table.

I  have never had a real job and at this point probably wouldn't even be  able to handle it because of my mental issues. It has been over 10 yrs  since I was last hugged, held, had anyone tell me they loved me even if  they didn't mean it.

I am so tired  of being alone and being single and never having been loved or have  affection and watching everyone else live the lives I dearly want to  live but can't acquire no matter how hard I try.

I  just wish I pulled the trigger 3 nights ago and ended it. I have  nothing left and at this point if anyone came into my life, I would  probably smother them with affection, love, touches, etc to the point  they would run away as fast as they came in to my life.

I left a letter asking to be cremated to make sure my body will be totally destroyed and I won&amp;#39;t remain conscious by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought of all the pros and cons, but in the end if I&amp;#39;m dead, not one of the cons won&amp;#39;t matter. My family that I love is going to be torn apart, okay. But I&amp;#39;ll be dead and I won&amp;#39;t feel their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart is beating fast because I&amp;#39;m really going to do this. 
I&amp;#39;m writing here with the hope that something will come up that makes me give up besides phrases I&amp;#39;ve heard that I have a lot to conquer in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Freshmen year was supposed to be the start of the best years of my life, at least that's what everyone told me, and I was stupid enough to believe it. This year has been an absolute shit-show and I don't want 3 more years of this.

At the beginning of this year a ""nice guy"" asked me out and I told him no, and he made my life hell. He stalked me online and in person, his friends called me a whore, slut, faggot and he has done the same to my best friend. He cried on livestream about how I was a terrible person who lead him on and how he wanted to kill himself because f my rejection. I got death threats and was told to kill myself several times by his friends. This is still going on, me and my friend are still getting stalked by him.

I also end up ruining good things. I always end up saying something that makes people mad, or I annoy them and they always leave. I was really close with a lot of people, but they all have grown distant. None of them talk to me outside and of and some of them barely talk to me in school, I'm not good enough to make people stay. 99% of people ignore me and when they don't ignore me they just do things to purposely make me upset and bully me, I don't fit in with anyone.

I broke my clean streak, I cut again. It doesn't hurt and I don't get pleasure from it, I don't know why I do it. I have control over it to, I can stop I just want to do it. 

I'm fucking useless, even my mom thinks this. I barely remember to do chores, and I all I do is sleep when I get home because everything is tiring. Even the things I love like reading, tech club, drawing, it's all too tiring and I just find myself going to sleep everyday once I get home. I avoid tech club because everyone always asks if I'm okay, but when I say no they walk away. I don't blame them though, I wouldn't want to have to deal with me either. 

There's a few people who care, and forgive me for saying this, but I'm too tired to care about how my death will affect them. I don't give a crap anymore. I just want it all to end, why should I care about how they'll feel? I'll be dead. Besides, in a few years they'll forget about me. I've already withdrawn from people so my death won't sting quite as bad.

I can't stop the thoughts that tell me to slash my wrists, to jump out my window, to hang myself from my closet door, to take a bunch of pills and go to bed forever, I want to rest. I want this all to stop, I don't care about what I'll miss, I don't fucking care. I just want a restart, but I can't so I'll take a game over. 14 years is enough for me

I've already made plans. I know what I'm going to give my friends after I die, I have a method and I even picked out an outfit to wear. Not going to lie, I'm getting some weird excitement from planning this. Not sure if it's exciting or just comforting or both. I'll probably won't post again before or on Sunday, so I'm guessing that this is gonna be my goodbye.

He cried on livestream about how I was a terrible person who lead him on and how he wanted to kill himself because f my rejection. I got death threats and was told to kill myself several times by his friends. This is still going on, me and my friend are still getting stalked by him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also end up ruining good things. I always end up saying something that makes people mad, or I annoy them and they always leave. I was really close with a lot of people, but they all have grown distant. None of them talk to me outside and of and some of them barely talk to me in school, I&amp;#39;m not good enough to make people stay. 99% of people ignore me and when they don&amp;#39;t ignore me they just do things to purposely make me upset and bully me, I don&amp;#39;t fit in with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke my clean streak, I cut again. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt and I don&amp;#39;t get pleasure from it, I don&amp;#39;t know why I do it. I have control over it to, I can stop I just want to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fucking useless, even my mom thinks this. I barely remember to do chores, and I all I do is sleep when I get home because everything is tiring. Even the things I love like reading, tech club, drawing, it&amp;#39;s all too tiring and I just find myself going to sleep everyday once I get home. I avoid tech club because everyone always asks if I&amp;#39;m okay, but when I say no they walk away. I don&amp;#39;t blame them though, I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to have to deal with me either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a few people who care, and forgive me for saying this, but I&amp;#39;m too tired to care about how my death will affect them. I don&amp;#39;t give a crap anymore. I just want it all to end, why should I care about how they&amp;#39;ll feel? I&amp;#39;ll be dead. Besides, in a few years they&amp;#39;ll forget about me. I&amp;#39;ve already withdrawn from people so my death won&amp;#39;t sting quite as bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stop the thoughts that tell me to slash my wrists, to jump out my window, to hang myself from my closet door, to take a bunch of pills and go to bed forever, I want to rest. I want this all to stop, I don&amp;#39;t care about what I&amp;#39;ll miss, I don&amp;#39;t fucking care. I just want a restart, but I can&amp;#39;t so I&amp;#39;ll take a game over. 14 years is enough for me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already made plans. I know what I&amp;#39;m going to give my friends after I die, I have a method and I even picked out an outfit to wear. Not going to lie, I&amp;#39;m getting some weird excitement from planning this. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s exciting or just comforting or both. I&amp;#39;ll probably won&amp;#39;t post again before or on Sunday, so I&amp;#39;m guessing that this is gonna be my goodbye. Goodbye everyone, I&amp;#39;m sorry to those who messaged me and tried to talk me out of it, just know that if it weren&amp;#39;t for you I would have been dead months ago. Goodbye, and with love Robby&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My life has been in this vicious cycle. 
I'm 33 years old. I've has more than 17 surgeries. 
Ive had 3 heart caths. 
Every single time I build up a life, sickness primarily interrupts and it's taken away. 
Last August, I had the bad covid pneumonia. I was living at home with my mother and grandmother. I couldn't eat or sleep for 2 weeks straight. I went to the er 8 times because of the pain. I didnt get my first breathing treatment until third week of August and it was only.because my mom decided to take me to an out of town hospital. But to make a long story short, it was mid sept before I was ok again. 
I ended up having the chance to move in with my best friend 3 hours away so I did. Finally got a job making money. Everything was going fine. I got covid again in Jan 2022 but it lasted a week and felt more of the flu than anything else. Went back to work. Mid Feb comes. The weekend comes. My friend went to his family and I went to mine to visit. The first night I took 60mg of zanaflex. It helps me sleep. I woke up at 5am. I went to get my phone. But there was a wooden dresser between me and my night stand. So I stood up, walked to my bedroom.door. tried to open it. There was no door knob. It was not there. There was a wooden boards on the crease of it. I remember panicking. So I turn around and om trying to turn the light on and couldn't touch the strings bc they were constantly moving from me. Then a white pew with a red cushion comes out. I try to get over it but I couldn't. So I just sat down on it and just prayed to Jesus. I got up and suddenly I could open my bedroom.door again. I never ever experienced something so real like that. It scared me. But things got worse after that. The days ahead my blood pressure was 80/60 and heart rate was 35 to 40 bpm. For days. Every time I tried to get up and walk, i had this dizzy feeling like I was gonna pass out. One time.i did fall. Finally one Wednesday night my mom takes me to the er. They give me one bag of fluids and send me home. Things didnt get better. I lost my job as they called me that morning. Then on Sunday bp was still low so my.mom takes me to a bigger hospital. They immediately transport me to another bigger hospital. Monday I had a heart cath. No blockages. But I had sepsis. And probably still do. I was there till thursday. That was end of feb.

I&amp;#39;m 33 years old. I&amp;#39;ve has more than 17 surgeries. 
Ive had 3 heart caths. 
Every single time I build up a life, sickness primarily interrupts and it&amp;#39;s taken away. 
Last August, I had the bad covid pneumonia. I was living at home with my mother and grandmother. I couldn&amp;#39;t eat or sleep for 2 weeks straight. I went to the er 8 times because of the pain. I didnt get my first breathing treatment until third week of August and it was only.because my mom decided to take me to an out of town hospital. But to make a long story short, it was mid sept before I was ok again. 
I ended up having the chance to move in with my best friend 3 hours away so I did. Finally got a job making money. Everything was going fine. I got covid again in Jan 2022 but it lasted a week and felt more of the flu than anything else. Went back to work. Mid Feb comes. The weekend comes. My friend went to his family and I went to mine to visit. The first night I took 60mg of zanaflex. It helps me sleep. I woke up at 5am. I went to get my phone. But there was a wooden dresser between me and my night stand. So I stood up, walked to my bedroom.door. tried to open it. There was no door knob. It was not there. There was a wooden boards on the crease of it. I remember panicking. So I turn around and om trying to turn the light on and couldn&amp;#39;t touch the strings bc they were constantly moving from me. Then a white pew with a red cushion comes out. I try to get over it but I couldn&amp;#39;t. So I just sat down on it and just prayed to Jesus. I got up and suddenly I could open my bedroom.door again. I never ever experienced something so real like that. It scared me. But things got worse after that. The days ahead my blood pressure was 80/60 and heart rate was 35 to 40 bpm. For days. Every time I tried to get up and walk, i had this dizzy feeling like I was gonna pass out. One time.i did fall. Finally one Wednesday night my mom takes me to the er. They give me one bag of fluids and send me home. Things didnt get better. I lost my job as they called me that morning. Then on Sunday bp was still low so my.mom takes me to a bigger hospital. They immediately transport me to another bigger hospital. Monday I had a heart cath. No blockages. But I had sepsis. And probably still do. I was there till thursday. That was end of feb. From then until now, I&amp;#39;ve lost 40 pounds. I have had a UTI for a month. Every thing I eat tastes horrible. I can&amp;#39;t hardly do anything without getting out of breath. I still haven&amp;#39;t had the strength to even get my things from my friends house.

We have a rainbow child (a baby girl) on the way and I already love her just as much as my wife, if not, more. My family is so proud of me after how much I've done to build a good home.

,SuicideWatch,"This is the sentence at the start of a rant that nobody will read or care about. I'm still in highschool even though I'm 21 because my mind never left 2017. I never left 2017 because that was the last time that a group of people gave enough of a shit to me to pretend to welcome me into their friend group and treat me as if I could be a normal functioning member of society. But in the words of my good ex-friend I poison everything I get to and I'm a shitty person with a shitty personality. No, they obviously didn't keep me around. I was too much of them to handle because I've been thinking of one thing since the 3rd grade. Before I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I knew I wanted to be dead. Before I knew I wanted to be dead, I knew that people didn't like me around. It's not that I wasn't charming or nice or funny or intelligent. No, I was all of those things. But I was also very weird and strange and scary. I scared the love right out of them like now I do with everyone. 

Everyone gets sad, right? But not me, I get too sad. I get sad for years: stalk and scream at people and call them names, break things, say I'm gonna kill myself, and leave the other person wondering when I'll say that it's them I want to kill.

Some people who have met me have thought that I was the coolest guy in the universe: destined for greatness, full of infinite potential with an unbreakable will. That is until I scared that feeling out of them. They're left wondering ""what the fuck did I just see happen?"". Thankfully, these people who've shared such intimacies with me all share a condition which allows them to compartmentalize the fact that they never really knew me. Then where there once was a connection, a cold towering metal wall emerges. 

I wake up to a house of bones where there is no other soul to cling to, and no one that I can pour myself into. I go through a day in a desolate but comfortable prison filled with anything I could ever possibly want but not a soul in site. Through the glowing of screens I encounter thousands of towering cold walls concealing souls that I could never attain. I try to pour myself into them, but I spill myself down the ditch into the gutter and back to the sewer where I belong.

I return to my slumber to dream of faint memories of a time once lost. Warm soothing feelings. Having my face touched and my hair stroked and holding an angels head in my arms. Holding that angel tightly trying to stop his tears from flowing. 

But nothing stops them from flowing and he pulls his hand away from mine and I feel his scorn as he shoves me away, tells me that I didn't hold him tight enough, that I was too late, that I didn't cry for him enough. 

I run out after him with my arms wide open but I'm greeted by a tower of cold, harsh, lifeless metal. The person who I used to entangle my soul with is in the arms of another.

There's no use running after them, and there's no use screaming because no one can hear underwater.

Sometimes a warmth that glows like the sun merely leads to a heart of soot and smoldering embers. And every night I return to it.

Putting lipstick on the abyss doesn't make it stop staring back at you, nothing does. That's a reality that's just a part of being alive. Whenever you think you found a way out, it's usually a sign that you're about to become victim to unspeakable tragedies the likes of which you couldn't have ever comprehended. 

This is a universe that takes vibrant youthful flame and turns it into smoldering embers. The more you struggle, the more you'll feel yourself choking on your own flames. And one day those flames will be extinguished whether by yourself or the uncaring entropic universe.

I’m always talking about just up and leaving without anyone knowing or explanation literally just dropping of the map. I hate everything about my life, absolutely all of it should have been, should be and should continue to be better. I shouldn’t have to live though any of this, every single god damn breath since my first memory feels like a waste and yet I continue breathing and it pisses me off. 

Then I start thinking about why I feel like this, why was I treated that way and why do I still try and justify all the wrongs everyone did just to keep the peace. I will argue for anyone else that every life is precious and that we are all here to better the life’s of each other. But yet here I am getting nothing from it. 

As a kid I was so selfless, at 6 years old I shouldn’t have felt the need to not eat all my food on my plate so my dad believed I was full and could eat what I hadn’t. What kind of child thinks to themselves “if I tell someone no I feel mean” I would give away my last sweet just to make anyone happy. I would never ask for food or money or toys of anyone. When my elderly neighbour gave me money I’d “drop it” outside there gate so they took it back without realising it was me giving it back. 
Why was I so selfless to think “if everyone around me is happy then how I feel doesn’t matter” at such a young age. 
I got bullied for being dirty and thin and I struggled to read and write so I thought I was stupid. I would go days without saying a word to anyone. I would hurt myself on the school floor on purpose just to feel and the teachers just told me to stop being silly. 

I always took on blame for anyone just so they wouldn’t be sad and would stay up all night with friends to make them feel safe and calm.

Nothing. I feel nothing. I have 1 friend left who I’m pushing away. 
I’m the family outcast 
I don’t leave the house for days or weeks and if it wasn’t for therapy I wouldn’t leave for months. 
I spend every day and night in my room just trying to think of anything to get me to the next day just to go through the same nothing all over again.

My chest won’t be naturally flat and will have scars, unless I get keyhole or peri, and I’ll have to get surgery for a penis. 

I have to spend years and money simply for things I should have had naturally and those are for things I can affect. Estrogen has permanently mutilated my body. I will always be short and have small hands and feet. My hips will always be wide, as they are all bone and fat distribution from T will not help. My fucking skeleton is female and I can’t do anything about it. 

And then we have my family, teachers, and school. My parents would find having a trans son to be shameful and could possibly send me to conversion therapy. Not that I blame them, I’ll just be wasting their money when they already have a son who doesn’t need any of that. My teachers would be malicious and unaccepting. The boys would never consider me part of the group and the girls would be even worse. 

The bathroom situation is whole nother problem. Even the people who aren’t assholes won’t see me as a man. When people know your trans, you are a women to them. The girls treat you like “one of the gals” and the boys stop treating you like they would with other dudes. It is simply the truth.

One day, my friend told about me to the counselor because I was isolating myself. The counselor seemed clueless, didn’t give a shit, and seemed to only be doing it out of liability. She didn’t actually care, she took pity on a sad, fucked up dude. I’m not talking to her ever again.

I’m not waiting until I’m 18, I’m already fucked. My body is already beyond repair and it will get even worse. All of this because of a fuck up that happened before I was born that I didn’t have a choice in. My cousins, classmates, and almost every other man get to be male, but not me. 

People will say I’ll get thought this and transition, but you know what? Maybe I don’t want to stab myself in the leg every few weeks. Maybe I don’t want scars as reminders. Maybe I don’t want to be reminded I went through the wrong puberty. I want to be normal, and if I’m not, then nothing else is good  enough.

,SuicideWatch,"So I'll top it off and say I'm privileged, despite coming from a poor country. Family is old money. Have top tier education and a decent job. Attractive, also. All of these things would have been great had I been born a cis male, and I thought I was for many years until my egg finally cracked. 

Every bit of dysphoria I feel has gotten so much worse. From a lone thought every few weeks it gnaws at me practically every waking moment. It could be a part of my body I don't like, or even worse, just ruminating about how shitty the world is for us. 

I'm privileged in that my long term girlfriend has accepted me for who I am and still loves me despite being straight (I guess she's flexible in that regard) and supports me unconditionally. My parents are tolerant and will support me as long as I don't go on HRT before giving them a grandchild. 

But damn if it still doesn't suck. I hate being closeted at work, even though my workplace is probably LGBT-friendly, just out of fear of anything that might happen. Of not passing. And I never will be able to go stealth because my country doesn't allow legal name or gender changes for any reason. 

I hate knowing that to most of the world I will always be some freakshow monster. I'm seeing the news about the trans wonan who raped another woman in a hospital ward in the UK. That's what people will think of when they think of me. Being just another psychotic man in a dress. Even those who do accept me, my friends and family, will take what I say at face value but will always believe in the bottom of their hearts that I'm a crazy man with a mental disorder making him delusional. ""Poor shiranaiy he's so confused. God bless him."" One false rape or SA accusation is all it'll take to turn the world against me and I'd sooner see myself 6 feet underground than inside a men's prison for any significant duration. 

My girlfriend is the only person I really feel like has my side and even then I'm afraid to lean on her too much. I fear she'll be tired of my shit since I break down practically every night from dysphoria and she has her own burdens to carry. She's practically my lifeline at the moment and if anything happened to our relationship I most likely will never find love again out of being lesbian AND trans, so Idon't see much reason not to join the 41%. 

My mental health is hanging by a thread and good therapists here are just so in demand that I need to wait more than a month in between sessions. And even then knowing that HRT is several years away because I can't afford to support a child yet is supposed to give me hope - my mother tells me to be strong knowing there's a light at the end of all of this. I feel like shit for not being able to tough it out and feeling terrible when I have any doubts about passing.

I don't know what to do. I'm socially transitioning littlr by little but hate myself for not passing and not being able to do anything about it.

&lt;p&gt;Every bit of dysphoria I feel has gotten so much worse. From a lone thought every few weeks it gnaws at me practically every waking moment. It could be a part of my body I don&amp;#39;t like, or even worse, just ruminating about how shitty the world is for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m privileged in that my long term girlfriend has accepted me for who I am and still loves me despite being straight (I guess she&amp;#39;s flexible in that regard) and supports me unconditionally. My parents are tolerant and will support me as long as I don&amp;#39;t go on HRT before giving them a grandchild. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But damn if it still doesn&amp;#39;t suck. I hate being closeted at work, even though my workplace is probably LGBT-friendly, just out of fear of anything that might happen. Of not passing. And I never will be able to go stealth because my country doesn&amp;#39;t allow legal name or gender changes for any reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate knowing that to most of the world I will always be some freakshow monster. I&amp;#39;m seeing the news about the trans wonan who raped another woman in a hospital ward in the UK. That&amp;#39;s what people will think of when they think of me. Being just another psychotic man in a dress. Even those who do accept me, my friends and family, will take what I say at face value but will always believe in the bottom of their hearts that I&amp;#39;m a crazy man with a mental disorder making him delusional. &amp;quot;Poor shiranaiy he&amp;#39;s so confused. God bless him.&amp;quot; One false rape or SA accusation is all it&amp;#39;ll take to turn the world against me and I&amp;#39;d sooner see myself 6 feet underground than inside a men&amp;#39;s prison for any significant duration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend is the only person I really feel like has my side and even then I&amp;#39;m afraid to lean on her too much. I fear she&amp;#39;ll be tired of my shit since I break down practically every night from dysphoria and she has her own burdens to carry. She&amp;#39;s practically my lifeline at the moment and if anything happened to our relationship I most likely will never find love again out of being lesbian AND trans, so Idon&amp;#39;t see much reason not to join the 41%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mental health is hanging by a thread and good therapists here are just so in demand that I need to wait more than a month in between sessions. And even then knowing that HRT is several years away because I can&amp;#39;t afford to support a child yet is supposed to give me hope - my mother tells me to be strong knowing there&amp;#39;s a light at the end of all of this. I feel like shit for not being able to tough it out and feeling terrible when I have any doubts about passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;m socially transitioning littlr by little but hate myself for not passing and not being able to do anything about it. I half consider just jumping off the  roof already.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, I’m (F15) in one of the top classes in school. Even though the government in my country claims to have taken out the ranking system in all schools, almost all the teachers still use it. They all claim that since we are in the top class, we should be better than those in other classes. It’s been barely 4 months and I can’t handle the pressure.

I’m doing my best to not t*ke my life but I have 4 chronic illnesses and I can’t sleep or eat peacefully anymore.  I’ve done all the medications I’ve been prescribed (it took 3 years for a diagnosis and to be taken seriously) but either none of them help or eventually the help wears off. I got some relief for periods of time in the last year or so but now I find it incredibly difficult to sleep and eat due to the constant pain everywhere, dry heaving and nightmares IF I do sleep.  I mostly take naps during the day but it feels like my body is on fire and i deal with chronic fatigue so not being able to sleep but being exhausted and fatigued constantly is an uphill battle. 

I remember feeling incredibly hopeless in summer 2020 and things have only gotten worse since then. I developed severe OCD (not relating to health surprisingly) that made me extremely su*cidal and sent me to the hospital last year and got diagnosed with diabetes a month ago. Things are piling up and I have to finish my school year (I don’t know how I will with the adhd, depression and constant illness) but I truly don’t see anything getting better for me.

I haven’t slept well in 2 weeks. Every single night is pain, severe nausea, medicine medicine medicine, dry heaving, crying, restless leg syndrome (as if I didn’t need more things to deal with at night time) and it makes me want to rip my body off me and just be a soul or something. Maybe then I could enjoy the simplest things and have a will to live.

I don’t wanna keep living, and the only reason I do is because of my family. My dad passed away 6 years ago and my mom was left to take care of me and my brother by herself, and I know me being sick isn’t helpful. (To be clear I’m not suicidal mainly because I feel like a burden, I’m just so sick of being sick and I can’t get help as much as I try)

My family is trying their best. My mom is so fucking strong and I don’t know how she does it. I don’t want to leave them, but I’m indescribably, fucking tired. This isn’t something that will ever get cured. They’re all chronic illnesses that I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life, and the only thing that’s promised to me is that I’ll have more horrible, horrible days ahead of me. Maybe I’ll find a medication that helps me, but I’d appreciate it if no one told me this. I’m so tired of false hope. I’ve tried more medications, lifestyle changes, prayers, doctors and surgeries than I can count and nothing helps. The only thing I have are my diagnoses. 

I know this would break my family. I just know. I know my mom, and while she’s the strongest person I’ve ever met, I know losing her CHILD would destroy her, so that’s why I stay. 

But I’m breaking apart here and I don’t know how much left of me there’ll be if I don’t get relief soon. I don’t go outside because I’m immunocompromised, and even if I tried to I’m ALWAYS sick, with pain or something else so I wouldn’t be able to enjoy my time regardless.  I can’t eat without immediately regretting it in pain and severe nausea, and I can’t sleep without hitting myself (for relief) crying my heart out, nearly vomiting, and trying as many meds as I can without ODing, only to be met with nightmares if I manage to fall asleep. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I rant often (and I don’t blame myself for it tbh) but I know that can be annoying to others. 

My whole point of this wasn’t to look for hope? I don’t think.

Maybe I wanna talk to someone, or maybe I just want someone to tell me SOMETHING that could actually make me feel better. Not false hope.

The only things I can think of that would make me feel freedom right now, would be that all my illnesses could and would be cured instantly, or that my family doesn’t need and that me dying wouldn’t destroy them. 

Neither of those things are possible.

I was literally skipping weeks then it turned to months and then I just quit at 16. I tried to start going to school again, at 17 but it didn't work out, my classmates where so rude to me always making fun of the things I couldn't do and after that I don't plan on finishing high school.
Everyday my life was miserable, I would wake up every day at a different time because I was not able to keep a good sleeping habit then I would play all day on my laptop. Finally when all the people of the house were out id drink whatever I would find vodka, wine, gin till I get drunk occasionally vomiting on the ground and cleaning it while still being drunk witch it was hard. Then after that I would eat and go back to playing and then sleep at like 4 am or 5 other times even at 8.
Then I tried suicide, I tried with various methods by cutting my throat, didn't work, by stabbing myself in the chest, was too much of a pussy to do it, take lots of Xanax pills, awful drug hate it, then I took lots of sleeping pills and had a panic attack texted my teacher, told her everything that was going on she helped a bit and the next day the school finally tolds my mother to take me to the hospital (because I told her that I wanted to die but she took weeks searching for a therapist and nothing).

I've worked on this problem, like, really worked every day, I almost cured, never gave up, i am always positive you could never say that i am on the edge, keep chatted with everyone, approached other girls IRL with no problem, i was successful with them. Successful only to the point of a first date it never got further. There were a lot of them, no joke, 800+. Once i had a period when i was meeting up to 5 girls for a 3 months everyday, but nobody stayed with me longer. I've tried different methods with every, i was sincere, i was a liar, i was rude, badass, kind or caring, i've tried to build a sirious relationships or just a hookup. I read a lot of literature, about girls, about mindset, i am stoic btw (i was, i guess, after this letter). I've tried forget about girls comletely for a few months, but i am lonely, i have no friends, i tried tp solve this problem, but it was even more difficult than with girls. 

And I finally met someone who was willing to met with me more than once, she was perfect match in our life goals she had the same views as me, she was pretty. We've chatted a lot, I was organized the dates, planned everything, she liked that a lot, that even turned her on. And i also liked that, to finally be a man, to solve problems, to be needed by someone. That lasted for two months. And one day i called her and she stated that ""She will rather read a book than met with me"". 
Okay, another loss, that was painful, but I'm used to be hated by evetyone, i dealt with it. Kept working on myself,  I was at gym daily, i liked it, i studied my profession daily, i liked it. But then, i burned out. I lost the point to do this. I know that life won't get better, it can't get only worse, I can't achieve my goals, they're impossible, especially with this world crisis. 

And also one thing happened. I accidentally stumbled upon my ex's social media, for the first time i've checked her pictures. Big mistake, huge. I promised myself to NEVER do this, but i did, for the first time in two years...

She was much more better, in terms of looks, and mood. She improved a lot, new style, new view to life etc... And everything is my favourite, i've teached her all of this, she liked it. Once i even painted her with cosmetics by myself, it was the most intimate and romatic thing that we've done, she was so happy then, with me. Now she's gorgeous with him, she coloured her hair, she did beautiful, big and sexy tatoo, wears high hills which i like, she is stylish now. She got a pet owl, she really likes them, and i do. I planned to gift her on of them while she was with her current bf in my apartments... Now she has everything that i was planning to give her, and ""thanks to him""... There is a lot more but i will not describe everything, that will take forever. That hit me hard.

This is so unfair, she did nothing to be happy, she was never alone, she was never broken, not a second, she had him already when i was her bf. And i was left with nothing, comletely broken, but didn't gave up for so long, kept working every day, never stopped. And received nothing. My life only gets worse.

Honestly, that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s probably bothering me the most at this point.  The only thing I ever enjoyed doing and thought I was good at, I&amp;#39;m not.  And it&amp;#39;s not like practicing the guitar.  I have no idea what&amp;#39;s right or wrong and I can&amp;#39;t figure it out to save my fucking life.  I seem to be good at one thing - wasting my time.  I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal for about six years now, but never had impulses like this.  I was more depressed six years ago then I am now, but I never thought I could muster the balls to shoot myself if given the opportunity.  I really feel like I might if I had the option nowadays.  I hope there&amp;#39;s something after so I can look down and see all the fake sad people acting like they give a shit.&lt;/p&gt;

I was sexually abused as a kid, locked in my room with my own piss and shit. Never had a mother who was truly there for me, she was just a kid her self. Dad didn't want a single fucking thing to do with me, but was there for my 3 younger siblings. 

My adult life hasn't been any better. I can't hold friendships / relationships and just implode on myself every 6 months / year. It's exhausting. 

I'm tired of waking up and within 5 minutes wanting the day to be over. I'm over people telling me it gets better. What exactly gets better? Because everything is just perpetually shit.

I can't imagine looking my mum in the eye one last time. I can't bare the thought of having to tell my dad why I don't have a career whilst my 20 year sister surpasses me in every aspect of life, although insure he'll have that same smug fucking smile while he does.

I don't honestly know where to start with this. Posting here has been in my mind for a couple months now, and still haven't come up with a snappy title or intro. Anyway, let's start in the most boring way possible (I'm sorry for those who actually will try to read this) with background information. As of writing this I'm 19 and will turn 20 later on this year, male, student, your average Joe; I'm not obese, 6ft, normal looking as far as i know/think.

I honestly don't know how i ended up in this situation. At every single step in my education (European public school) I've shot myself in the knee. I always chose something i never wanted to actually do and i regret it everyday.  
As far as i know I've felt like this to some degree since i was around 13-14 and i don't remember what triggered it or if puberty pulled a sick joke on me. My only friend of four years that i still have knows somewhat the situation of me being depressed and want to commit suicide, but I've always held back on some information and just given him the minimum just because for the years I've known him he's the type of guy that always have put others before himself, he's a person i aspire to be, someone i cannot be no matter how hard i try. He always say every time i mention it that he will support me through this and he says that he will be there if i need him, and that i should try to get professional help. I mean he's not wrong.  
I don't really know why i still haven't even i should. I'm not scared of getting therapy or getting medicated. I guess I'm scared of who will come out post therapy/medication. Will I still be me?

I've already tried to kill myself once before; overdosing pills really sucks, especially if you're a dumb motherfucker that don't get help afterwards and just lie there, alone, in pain, not getting help from anyone, laying there enjoying the silence. Well i survived that attempt and now I'm soon to try again, as I've learned my lesson and will not try to overdose again.  
This time it will be hanging myself. I first said when I was younger that ""Fuck it, let's try for 20 and if life still sucks I will kill myself"" and life hasn't gotten better so here I am. The date where I've planned this to go down is at the start of summer break.  
My parents who i somewhat despise don't know anything have started to remind me that I will need to get a job when summer starts and every time they say it I can't deny that I think that they don't need to worry anymore soon. That it all will be okay, and I got a plan. I won't be useless, mentally challenged or stupid anymore, not for long. My parents aren't really the nicest. They're fakes, they put on a mask when around other people and act like all is well and fine. When there's no one around they verbally and physically abuse you. Nowadays it's more verbal, the physical abuse stopped when I was around 10.

I don't know if this is a confession or will be acting as a substitute for a suicide letter. I'm not that great at writing, especially when my English is not my native language. But I've always wanted to be a writer of some sort, but realizing that i am hot garbage when it comes to typing, grammar, adverb etc I gave up on it. I guess it's because I grew up reading due to me not having a lot of friends and getting bullied constantly through age 6-14. At some point I got serious anger issues and whenever they teased me and it turned physical I could end up banging one of the kids face in the ground repeatedly, and if teachers didn't intervene I probably would've tried to curb stomp him or something. I don't want it to sound like a cringe fanfiction or something so I'll add that I took my fair share of beatings, but I also dealt a fair share of beatings too. The anger issues never really disappeared, but i manage to keep them under control for the most part still to this day. 

I don't know how I feel, I can't explain it. All I know is that I don't want help, I want to die. I deserve to die. It is my time to give penance. I have no other alternative left, I can't go on living, there's no potential future left. I'm a failure in the large biological race. I'm both looking forward and dreading the day, but in the end I have to do it. I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

I can't fuck this up. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. FOR ONCE DON'T FUCK IT UP AS YOU ALWAYS DO.

I feel like I need to do this, if I don't everything will just get worse. I'm slowly loosing my mind and feel more detached to reality and progressively feel like things aren't real. I feel like I'm slowly going insane, and it hurts. I probably could elaborate for eternity if given the time but I think I've gotten my thoughts across.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm honestly so done with life. There's nothing worth living for. The only reason why I'm still alive is that I don't want my family do deal with my death. I know if I die, my mum will kill herself, and I don't want that. My sister will be scarred for life, my brothers will be scarred for life, and my dad will die inside. 

You probably think ""you must be stupid, you have a family who love you, why are you suicidal?"" Truth is I don't care that I have a caring family. My mother has done so much shit that I honestly couldn't give 2 shits about her, my dad has never said the words ""I love you"" to me, neither have my 2 brothers. Yes, they probably do love me, but they for sure aren't fucking showing it. 

Your next thought might be ""just talk to your friends about whatever you're going through"". I've done that. I've talked to one friend, and she's an amazing person and all. Checked up on me every day, you get the point. But, no matter how hard she cares, it's not enough. She's just one person out of many who I consider my friends. I recently told some other people, who I consider close friends, that I've been really struggling over the past couple of months. I mean I was close to killing myself on multiple occasions type of struggling. I told them that I wanted to talk to them in-person - to explain what happened to me that made me so numb (this was done via snap, btw, I know, not ideal, but we were all isolating due to covid at the time). I saw them at university today - none of them said hi. None of them asked how I was. How I was feeling. Whether I wanted to talk. They didn't even say bye when they left. Why live when everyone around you (but one person) doesn't give a flying fuck. Maybe they do care, but they certainly aren't bloody showing it. 

No, I can't get better friends. Yes, I've tried. Partly, I don't want to get better friends, since my current friend group is ideal for me. We vibe, they just don't seem to care about how I'm personally doing. Yes, I know that means they don't care about me, I know. I have issues, ik.

Your next thought is ""get professional help"". That is one line I am not willing to cross, at least at this point in time. You see, I'm a medical student. If word comes out that I'm seeing a shrink, fuck knows what my peers will think of me. Fuck knows what the doctors who I'll be shadowing next year will think of me in the hospital next door. No matter how mainstream mental health is right now, deep inside people will see me as weak. In my field, this is not idea. Yes, I know, confidentiality, yada yada yada, unfortunately, confidentiality isn't really stuck well with where I am.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been dealing with crippling depression for over twenty years now, getting psychiatric care for most of it. I’ve dealt with a lot, more suicide attempts than I can remember, hospitalizations, I think I’ve had over 1000 stitches and staples from self harm (I’m not into that anymore), I’ve lived on the streets for about a decade, on Skid Row in LA, to West Oakland and Kansas City, Then Dallas… I’m back in Los Angeles now… living in a car.  
 

I’m posting this using my main account. Feel free to browse my nine year post history that started when I first got clean from heroin until now, where I’m perfectly sober but more miserable than I’ve ever been.  
 

I’ve been locked up a ton of times, like 14 arrests. It was dumb stuff like drug possession like ten years ago but still, I can never live down the stigma. Getting a job has been one of the toughest challenges yet. I’ve built up an IT resume with achievements and tons of experience, but it’s very rare I can get the single odd temp job thrown my way.  
 

I was raised in a cult, a strict fundamentalist pastors family. I went to a music school in Hollywood after high school and got disowned by my parents for using cocaine. In college. In music school. In Hollywood. Fucking assholes. My biological dad is dead, mom is an alcoholic and I don’t talk to her.  
 

I’ve had my heart broken more times than I can count. I’ve been in long term relationships and I’ve even had a son I had to give up for adoption. I overcame a 6 year heroin addiction. On the streets I had been slamming heroin and cocaine, overdosing more times than I can remember. I’ve woken up with paramedics on tops of me, in strange alleys, I lived in a burned down warehouse in South Central LA for two months. My life has had ups and downs, but with a general downward trend for some time.  
 

My whole life, my biggest problem has been a lack of interest in things. I am however empathetic and emotionally there… I can’t find anything to interest me. I have an “ambivalence towards life” is how one of my shrinks put it. I don’t care about anything but here’s the real fucked up part: I really WANT to care. I read self care books and all the famous books people talk about. I learn as much about science and math and history as I can, all day watching videos and scrolling Reddit…   
 

My heart is broken everyday when I see people smiling and laughing and raising families and I know deep down I can never be a part of their world. Happiness exists… but not for me. And I’ve long accepted this. But how long is this supposed to last? I keep soldiering on, living in some of the worst conditions in the US. I’m surrounded by darkness and sorrow and despair.  
 

I think I want to live, but at what cost? I want help but my friends either ignore me or tell me I should be locked up in a psych ward. That is not help. I’m screaming into an empty room.

I’ve dealt with a lot, more suicide attempts than I can remember, hospitalizations, I think I’ve had over 1000 stitches and staples from self harm (I’m not into that anymore), I’ve lived on the streets for about a decade, on Skid Row in LA, to West Oakland and Kansas City, Then Dallas… I’m back in Los Angeles now… living in a car.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m posting this using my main account. Feel free to browse my nine year post history that started when I first got clean from heroin until now, where I’m perfectly sober but more miserable than I’ve ever been.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been locked up a ton of times, like 14 arrests. It was dumb stuff like drug possession like ten years ago but still, I can never live down the stigma. Getting a job has been one of the toughest challenges yet. I’ve built up an IT resume with achievements and tons of experience, but it’s very rare I can get the single odd temp job thrown my way.  &lt;/p&gt;

I went to my mother asking her to take care of me. She turned on me and made it all about her, her and her friend that killed herself. I didn't even try my Dad, he's more of a suicidal mess than I am, and about half as emotionally intelligent. 

I don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm sad a lot. It's lonely, here. It's so lonely. I want to be angry at my mother, to hold a grudge, but I just can't do it. I love her too much. I'm still surprised she reacted like she did, we're normally so close. I just can't stay angry at her, but she hurt me so much. And now I'm all alone.

I don't understand how I'm both so angry at her and just want her approval so much at the same time. I just want her to be proud of me. The worst part is, she *says* she's proud of me, but I just can't make myself believe it. It's not her fault I can't believe her, that one's mine. She's an honest woman, she says what she thinks, often times to the point where it upsets and confuses other people. 

She praises my guitar-playing skills, but I can't think about anything except how bad I must sound, how I just can't get the bridge to *Friday I'm In Love* right, or how I've been playing with the capo on lopsided for the past ten minutes. She praises my fanfiction, but I just can't think about how it'll never be as good as the source material, how she'll never be as invested in it as she would be if it was the original material. 

Why is it that even when I get what I want, I'm still not happy? I do want her praise, right? That *is* What I want? 

If it's not, then what *do* I want? 

I've been watching this show called *Power Rangers Lost Galaxy* the past few days, and there's one character in it I adore. Her name is Kendrix Morgan, and she's so great. I wish I could just *be* her, instead of this idiot teenager who still desperately wants to go back to being eleven. 

What makes Kendrix so wonderful? 

What's the difference between her and everyone else? 

How is she so naturally good? 

It's not like she's real, anyway. I guess I can put those questions to rest. But I just like Kendrix so much. 

Well, this ramble has gone on too long, so I'll say goodbye. I don't understand everything with my mother, I don't understand my own stupid emotions, I just want to be Kendrix who's smart and kind, and also a a bonus dies at the end to save everyone, *and* comes back! I just want my mother to take care of me, I just want to stop hurting.

&lt;p&gt;I went to my mother asking her to take care of me. She turned on me and made it all about her, her and her friend that killed herself. I didn&amp;#39;t even try my Dad, he&amp;#39;s more of a suicidal mess than I am, and about half as emotionally intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have anyone else to talk to. I&amp;#39;m sad a lot. It&amp;#39;s lonely, here. It&amp;#39;s so lonely. I want to be angry at my mother, to hold a grudge, but I just can&amp;#39;t do it. I love her too much. I&amp;#39;m still surprised she reacted like she did, we&amp;#39;re normally so close. I just can&amp;#39;t stay angry at her, but she hurt me so much. And now I&amp;#39;m all alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand how I&amp;#39;m both so angry at her and just want her approval so much at the same time. I just want her to be proud of me. The worst part is, she &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; she&amp;#39;s proud of me, but I just can&amp;#39;t make myself believe it. It&amp;#39;s not her fault I can&amp;#39;t believe her, that one&amp;#39;s mine. She&amp;#39;s an honest woman, she says what she thinks, often times to the point where it upsets and confuses other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She praises my guitar-playing skills, but I can&amp;#39;t think about anything except how bad I must sound, how I just can&amp;#39;t get the bridge to &lt;em&gt;Friday I&amp;#39;m In Love&lt;/em&gt; right, or how I&amp;#39;ve been playing with the capo on lopsided for the past ten minutes. She praises my fanfiction, but I just can&amp;#39;t think about how it&amp;#39;ll never be as good as the source material, how she&amp;#39;ll never be as invested in it as she would be if it was the original material. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that even when I get what I want, I&amp;#39;m still not happy? I do want her praise, right? That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; What I want? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s not, then what &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; I want? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been watching this show called &lt;em&gt;Power Rangers Lost Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; the past few days, and there&amp;#39;s one character in it I adore. Her name is Kendrix Morgan, and she&amp;#39;s so great. I wish I could just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; her, instead of this idiot teenager who still desperately wants to go back to being eleven. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Kendrix so wonderful? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the difference between her and everyone else? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is she so naturally good? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like she&amp;#39;s real, anyway. I guess I can put those questions to rest. But I just like Kendrix so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this ramble has gone on too long, so I&amp;#39;ll say goodbye. I don&amp;#39;t understand everything with my mother, I don&amp;#39;t understand my own stupid emotions, I just want to be Kendrix who&amp;#39;s smart and kind, and also a a bonus dies at the end to save everyone, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; comes back! I just want my mother to take care of me, I just want to stop hurting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need a hug right now.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Long post, sorry..  
I have a boyfriend who is diagnosed with depression and has suicidal thoughts. They started to self-harm themselves again after weeks of not doing so.A little backstory, we are in a Long Distance Relationship and known each other for half a year, he won't let me visit him until December this year, but I'm worried something happens until then. He has been starting to get distant and isolates himself since a week, states he wants to be alone, I'm not sure if he needs alone time or if it's because of his depression.I'm scared he'll do something or that his wounds open again, two days ago he said he's been tasting blood in his mouth 24/7 because a rather big wound opened which wasn't fully healed yet and he didn't deny that he didn't self-harm.

I have talked to him about therapy once last year, but as far as I know he doesn't go nor does he want to. He is hesitant and doesn't open up when talking about his depression or suicidal thoughts, the only times I witness or hear from it is when it's happening and he has a breakdown. I can't even ask him how he feels daily, he doesn't like answering that question and I found out it's because he doesn't want to lie to me. When I ask him how his day was, he says he doesn't know.

I'm at loss. I've never dealt with someone who is depressed or has suicidal thoughts before, how can I approach him if he doesn't want to talk about his depression or thoughts? He's already tried to attempt suicide a few times before he met me, I'm scared he'll try again. He said he will tell me if he'd die, but I don't want that day to come. We do plan to have a future together eventually, but I'm just so scared. I don't want to lose him. I love him. I'm always checking up on him daily, sending messages, making apparent I'm here, sometimes making little gifts like drawings.

He lives alone (with a few cats), his sister is in a coma right now and he doesn't have any other family members. He lives so far away, I did tell him if he'd let me I'd come visit immediately, but he didn't respond to that. Generally, he always reponds so late these days and sometimes completely ignores - as I've mentioned, being distant and isolating himself (but he did say he want to be alone a bit a week ago but since he's harmed himself again two days ago I'm not sure).

He pretty much hates (humanity) human interaction, only has few people he ""withstands"", likes, I'm one of them. I get that that might be a reason he won't go to therapy, but ultimately I don't know. He doesn't open up to me and I only know what's happening when he has breakdowns.

Please, any help is appreciated, what can I do? I can't get through him. I'm scared. He says he's fine, but his behavior tells me otherwise. I'm scared.

It's been nearly a year and her pleads with me mimic my internal voice. I can't do it. No matter what plan or goals or charts or any plan I try.

I am only capable of productivity when I am forced into it (job for money) or threatened by something external (parents growing up, now fiancé). 

the pills don't help. I've tried so many different therapists and doses of four different ADHD pills and three different depression meds and I just sit. I do nothing. The only serve to make me cry less and make it so I can go to work and brush my teeth. Which is something, I suppose. But not enough. Not enough for me to ever be a good partner, father, or really do anything involving another person. I suppose I could take care of a dog. Might be my hard limit there. 

There is no reason for me to be like this. I have no traumas, no dark past, no rough upbringing. I have two parents in a happy marriage who love me more than life in a middle class house in a great school district. I was a bit of a weird kid growing up but i had friends, I was happy. No deaths in the family to speak of. No tragedies or traumas. No reason I shouldn't be a perfectly normal person. But the pills don't help and the therapists have no idea why I'm like this. 

I love my fiancé more than anything. She is my opposite. For starters, she has actual reasons to be sad. Find any psych textbook, rip out all the types of trauma, put them on a dart board, and toss a dart blindfolded at it and you'll be bound to hit something she has experienced. And yet she persists. She keeps going. She drives herself through the tears and the suicidality and the self loathing and stress of all she does and she keeps going and EXCELLS. Top of her class, top employee wherever she graces with her presence. And it all comes from within. I look at her in awe and pride. So smart, so driven, so kind. A bright future. She is truly what I wish I was. And I have to set her free. I can't keep her trapped with me. She won't leave me. She yells and screams and begs and pleads with me because I know deep down she loves me but I really don't think she'll leave me. But she has to. I used to get panic attacks at the thought of her leaving but ever since we moved in together they have subsided significantly. I first thought it was because I was more secure in the relationship now that we've taken it to the next level (moving in, getting engaged) but that's not it at all. I think I welcome her leaving me. I think I know deep down I won't get better and she has to free herself from me, from my failure. 

I don't know if I want to kill myself. I don't think I will do it. Maybe on my own in a little apartment with nobody to disappoint I'll be able to keep going. Maybe tread water. I have a decent job that I like after all, and a few friends. But I worry that I won't be able to stay away from her. Or at least ever move on. And that suggests to me that I have to end my life to free her. Maybe that's dramatic, maybe I'll have the restraint to leave her alone. I probably will. But can I ever get there?

She yells and screams and begs and pleads with me because I know deep down she loves me but I really don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;ll leave me. But she has to. I used to get panic attacks at the thought of her leaving but ever since we moved in together they have subsided significantly. I first thought it was because I was more secure in the relationship now that we&amp;#39;ve taken it to the next level (moving in, getting engaged) but that&amp;#39;s not it at all. I think I welcome her leaving me. I think I know deep down I won&amp;#39;t get better and she has to free herself from me, from my failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t think I will do it. Maybe on my own in a little apartment with nobody to disappoint I&amp;#39;ll be able to keep going. Maybe tread water. I have a decent job that I like after all, and a few friends. But I worry that I won&amp;#39;t be able to stay away from her. Or at least ever move on. And that suggests to me that I have to end my life to free her. Maybe that&amp;#39;s dramatic, maybe I&amp;#39;ll have the restraint to leave her alone. I probably will. But can I ever get there? Will either of us have the nuts to leave the other? I don&amp;#39;t think I will. I love her too much to rip off the bandage even though i know I&amp;#39;m broken. That I can&amp;#39;t get better. That I can&amp;#39;t ruin her life by staying in it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Dear Sabrina,

  I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry Sabrina, but I don't think I can do this anymore. It hurts so much and I can't think straight anymore. I'm such a fucking coward but I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore. I feel so inhuman and garbage and I just can't take it anymore, I give up.  I don't think I can endure the possible years of therapy and medicine, feeling emotionless and void, it scares me so much and I don't know why. 

  And please don't take this as your fault, you have done nothing wrong against me. You have been nothing but great and awesome to me and you were honestly the girl of my dreams. The girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. The girl I wanted to share memories with. The girl that carries our children. And I'm sorry but I honestly don't think I'm going to be able to grow anymore. I feel so stuck in this never ending cycle and I just don't want to be in this Earth anymore. I'm so tired of hurting myself, and hurting you, and others in my life, I feel so evil. I just can't do it anymore. 

  I love you so much Sabrina. I really do, with all my heart. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong for you and for what I'm about to do now. And I know that no amount of words or actions could ever pardon me from this, but I hate my life so much. You were one of the only good things to come into my life and I ruined it. I ruined our relationship. I ruined the love we have for one another to point where we had to take a break. 

  I feel like every chance I get to turn my life around and be better, I just ruin and destroy it. And I'm sorry for doing this. I'm sorry for causing you to hurt. To feel guilty. I'm sorry for making you feel neglected at times. I'm sorry for not being there all the time. For the nights I've fallen asleep early. For the moments I've gotten snippy with you or lashed out on you. I know I wasn't the best boyfriend on the planet, but when I'm with you, it made me want to be. It made me want to try and be the best boyfriend I could possibly be and I couldn't have even done that.

  There's so much pain that I've brought to you that I could never forgive myself for. You've shown me so many wonders and the truest love I could have ever felt and I repaid that back in tainted love, emoty promises, and disrespect. I honestly don't deserve the love and compassion you've shown me. I treated you so unfairly. And again please don't think that this is your fault, because it's not, and please don't feel guilty. I'm the one who made the wrong decisions and continue to do so. Please don't forget that I loved you, and please don't think too long of me. I always loved you and I always will. You have been the star in my empty night sky and I loved being able to say that I was yours.
 
 I wish you the best of luck in this life. I hope that you're able to succeed in digital art, psychology, engineering, or whatever the future holds for you. You are a talented, honest, awesome person and I know you're going to do great things in life. And I know that you'll find someone who can treat you 1000× better than I ever did, and lead a happy family with them. I'm sorry it couldn't have been me. And I'm sorry for hurting you this one last time. But I know you're strong, and you can overcome anything. 

  Please don't ever forget how beautiful you are. Or how your voice is that of the singing birds. Or how your smile could melt anyone's heart. You are the most perfect woman on this planet, please don't ever forget that.

   This is my final goodbye Sabrina, if I've sent this to you it means that I've killed myself or am currently attempting. And I know this is going to hurt a lot, but I can't do it anymore. Everyday it feels like I'm being stabbed in the heart and in the chest and I just want it to stop. Goodbye my soulmate, my princess, my love, my wife, the love of my short lived life. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

Love,

You have been the star in my empty night sky and I loved being able to say that I was yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you the best of luck in this life. I hope that you&amp;#39;re able to succeed in digital art, psychology, engineering, or whatever the future holds for you. You are a talented, honest, awesome person and I know you&amp;#39;re going to do great things in life. And I know that you&amp;#39;ll find someone who can treat you 1000× better than I ever did, and lead a happy family with them. I&amp;#39;m sorry it couldn&amp;#39;t have been me. And I&amp;#39;m sorry for hurting you this one last time. But I know you&amp;#39;re strong, and you can overcome anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t ever forget how beautiful you are. Or how your voice is that of the singing birds. Or how your smile could melt anyone&amp;#39;s heart. You are the most perfect woman on this planet, please don&amp;#39;t ever forget that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my final goodbye Sabrina, if I&amp;#39;ve sent this to you it means that I&amp;#39;ve killed myself or am currently attempting. And I know this is going to hurt a lot, but I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore. Everyday it feels like I&amp;#39;m being stabbed in the heart and in the chest and I just want it to stop. Goodbye my soulmate, my princess, my love, my wife, the love of my short lived life. I&amp;#39;m so sorry. I love you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I don't think anyone will read this, and that's fine. When I was 13 (21 now) was the first time I ever planned it. Of course I didn't go through with it, being rational and thinking if I just make it another 2 years, I'll look back and laugh. Two years went by, and I did not laugh. But I decided to wait another 2 years and look back. Still didn't laugh. At 17 due to stupid circumstances I had to move out and take care of myself. For a while, this made me feel good actually. That is until my job at UPS dried up and I was forced to look elsewhere. The next one was fucking awful, I don't want to get into it but I lasted longer than any other new-hire they had. I got into fights and shouting matches with people I hated fucking seeing every day. This time I came very, very close until I met this girl, now my ex, who made me once again feel optimistic about being alive. Throughout our relationship, I would constantly quit jobs, go unemployed for a few months, living off my savings then jump to another one I hated. After 3 years of living in this townhouse that kept having issues, I decided that I couldn't keep working 12-14 hours and returning to my depressing room that I hate. I truly wanted to make the jump and pursue my purpose. I sat in the basement one night, after my sibling told me she would never contact me again when this is all over, yet again looking back and thinking why didn't I just wrap this all up when I was 13? Sure, I had some interesting and fun times, but nothing meaningful to me. I gained lots of wisdom, but no where to apply it. It really dawned on me just how pointless it all was. The experiences I had did not make up for all of the pain. My grandmother telling me I belong in the dark, my mother gaslighting and using witchcraft against me. I'm only slightly skimming the surface here, I'm not here to tell my life story really. I decided I had nothing to fucking lose, so I decided to live in the car to force myself away from bills, and to force myself to be outside and not in my room. I had also started a clothing brand in which I put my heart and soul into, and always get compliments on my designs when people see me wearing it. I really wanted to just wrap my life up, because the life I want to live keeps fleeing from me. So I told myself one last time, you can end it here in this basement or you can try ONE more time and look back on this day. I lived in the car for 4 months, without plates or registration, knocking out my whole list of shit I had to get together, working in the library on my brand and another business opportunity that came up in the summer. My job called me back, after I quit a month prior, and I was running low on cash, so I took it. 12-14 hours hard labor, then I'd hit the gym before they closed to shower, then find a good parking lot and sleep for a few hours just to repeat. Eventually I got fired for flipping out on a motherfucker that gave me issues for no reason, I think because this girl had a crush on me, and shortly after found myself living in an office my associates and I decided we needed to continue our business, which I'm losing faith more and more but I keep pushing forward. I'm now at the final point, where I look back at my day in that basement and realize I'm no where near where I pleaded with God to put me. My car got stolen and I'm stuck. I get to shower maybe once a week. I feel nothing but isolation. I sold everything over time so I could keep surviving. I had to sell stocks when they were low and now they're worth twice what I sold them for. I don't even cry anymore when I think about ending my life. After many sessions of looking within myself, my brain has completely rationalized this. I cannot and will not go much longer. I have an official date set in which I've thought out carefully. I see angelic signs and repeating numbers that tell me I'm on the right track, but I'm at the point where I think I'm just being spiritually fucked with. If by the date I set, it doesn't start to look up, I rationally figure it never will. If my businesses don't make it and I have to go back to hard labor 12-14 hours a day, there's just no reason for me to keep going. I'm meant for so much more than this. I feel I've wasted my best years, my young years. Most people I come into contact with think highly of me, and assume I'm going places. I do everything I can to uplift those around me and convince them to keep going with optimism. Lately I've been having very dark thoughts about hurting everyone that has hurt me. You'd never look at me and think I would be having these thoughts. My mind goes to dark places every single day, usually about how I'm not good enough and I'm a piece of shit and the world would actually be a better place without me. Boo fucking hoo lol.

When I was 13 (21 now) was the first time I ever planned it. Of course I didn&amp;#39;t go through with it, being rational and thinking if I just make it another 2 years, I&amp;#39;ll look back and laugh. Two years went by, and I did not laugh. But I decided to wait another 2 years and look back. Still didn&amp;#39;t laugh. At 17 due to stupid circumstances I had to move out and take care of myself. For a while, this made me feel good actually. That is until my job at UPS dried up and I was forced to look elsewhere. The next one was fucking awful, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into it but I lasted longer than any other new-hire they had. I got into fights and shouting matches with people I hated fucking seeing every day. This time I came very, very close until I met this girl, now my ex, who made me once again feel optimistic about being alive. Throughout our relationship, I would constantly quit jobs, go unemployed for a few months, living off my savings then jump to another one I hated. After 3 years of living in this townhouse that kept having issues, I decided that I couldn&amp;#39;t keep working 12-14 hours and returning to my depressing room that I hate. I truly wanted to make the jump and pursue my purpose. I sat in the basement one night, after my sibling told me she would never contact me again when this is all over, yet again looking back and thinking why didn&amp;#39;t I just wrap this all up when I was 13? Sure, I had some interesting and fun times, but nothing meaningful to me. I gained lots of wisdom, but no where to apply it. It really dawned on me just how pointless it all was. The experiences I had did not make up for all of the pain. My grandmother telling me I belong in the dark, my mother gaslighting and using witchcraft against me. I&amp;#39;m only slightly skimming the surface here, I&amp;#39;m not here to tell my life story really. I decided I had nothing to fucking lose, so I decided to live in the car to force myself away from bills, and to force myself to be outside and not in my room. I had also started a clothing brand in which I put my heart and soul into, and always get compliments on my designs when people see me wearing it. I really wanted to just wrap my life up, because the life I want to live keeps fleeing from me. So I told myself one last time, you can end it here in this basement or you can try ONE more time and look back on this day. I lived in the car for 4 months, without plates or registration, knocking out my whole list of shit I had to get together, working in the library on my brand and another business opportunity that came up in the summer. My job called me back, after I quit a month prior, and I was running low on cash, so I took it. 12-14 hours hard labor, then I&amp;#39;d hit the gym before they closed to shower, then find a good parking lot and sleep for a few hours just to repeat. Eventually I got fired for flipping out on a motherfucker that gave me issues for no reason, I think because this girl had a crush on me, and shortly after found myself living in an office my associates and I decided we needed to continue our business, which I&amp;#39;m losing faith more and more but I keep pushing forward. I&amp;#39;m now at the final point, where I look back at my day in that basement and realize I&amp;#39;m no where near where I pleaded with God to put me. My car got stolen and I&amp;#39;m stuck. I get to shower maybe once a week. I feel nothing but isolation. I sold everything over time so I could keep surviving. I had to sell stocks when they were low and now they&amp;#39;re worth twice what I sold them for. I don&amp;#39;t even cry anymore when I think about ending my life. After many sessions of looking within myself, my brain has completely rationalized this. I cannot and will not go much longer. I have an official date set in which I&amp;#39;ve thought out carefully. I see angelic signs and repeating numbers that tell me I&amp;#39;m on the right track, but I&amp;#39;m at the point where I think I&amp;#39;m just being spiritually fucked with. If by the date I set, it doesn&amp;#39;t start to look up, I rationally figure it never will. If my businesses don&amp;#39;t make it and I have to go back to hard labor 12-14 hours a day, there&amp;#39;s just no reason for me to keep going. I&amp;#39;m meant for so much more than this. I feel I&amp;#39;ve wasted my best years, my young years. Most people I come into contact with think highly of me, and assume I&amp;#39;m going places. I do everything I can to uplift those around me and convince them to keep going with optimism. Lately I&amp;#39;ve been having very dark thoughts about hurting everyone that has hurt me. You&amp;#39;d never look at me and think I would be having these thoughts. My mind goes to dark places every single day, usually about how I&amp;#39;m not good enough and I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit and the world would actually be a better place without me. Boo fucking hoo lol. Anyways, I have no one to share this with and figured I&amp;#39;d just spill it out somewhere. I truly hope anyone reading this finds purpose in their lives. If not, I don&amp;#39;t blame you for rationalizing it yourself unfortunately. At this point in my life, I can&amp;#39;t tell you it gets better nor do I expect it to anymore. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm feeling suicidal.  I've felt this way in the past. There are many times I wished I was killed before I ever had children.  When my oldest was 6, I attempted suicide the day after Christmas.  I wasn't trying to ruin the holidays.  I had just been depressed for so long.  I kept everything inside to myself.  I made an appointment to see a therapist the week before,  but my appointment was 3 weeks away.  That night I called the suicide prevention hotline, but I never got through to anyone.   I was in hold for an extremely long time.  I decided to seek help from my family.  I told my boyfriend at the time that I was feeling suicidal,  and to please don't leave me.  He told me to go and kill myself.  Then he took our daughter to his grandmother's house.  I called my mom,  and she told me that she was tired of my drama.  I called my dad, and he told me to stop the noise. I called my sister,  and she didn't pick up.  I was upset for many reasons.  One was that I wanted to leave my ""boyfriend"", but he wouldn't let me. He was extremely emotionally abusive to me. He would lie about any and every little thing.  Then I catch him in a lie sad he screamed at me for bugging him.  He screamed at me for keeping tabs in him like he's a kid. He threatened to abandon me everyday for a period in time.  One day I decided to help him pack, so his clothes wouldn't get wrinkled,  and he beat me up.  I didn't tell my family the ins and outs of our relationship, and they liked him. He would complain to my family that I'm so sensitive and I ask a million questions.  They believed him, and then add their input.  Mom would add that I was a terrorist when I was ready.  My mom thinking I was a terrorist,  was just me trying to explain to her why I was sad. My mom never wanted to hear that I was sad.  She doesn't believe in mental health.   My crying in my bed at night would get my screamed at.   My dad hates emotions,  the end.  My childhood with him was him screaming ""stop the noise"", when I cried.  My parents definitely hugged me and kissed me, just never when I was sad or upset.  They never tried to comfort me. The fact that I am admittedly sensitive,  and get sad easily,  makes that fact worse.  My mom treated me differently from my sister, because by the time I lived with only her, I reminded her of my dad, whom she hated. I think my sister was blind to the fact that we can do the exact same thing,  and I would get treated so harshly.  I was tired of the world,  so I took half a bottle of aspirin.  I was hoping go bleed out. I was in the psychiatric ward for 3 weeks after they gave me activated charcoal. I was humiliated.  My parents never acknowledged that I called them that day.  My dad had the nerve to ask me ""what happened"" when he visited me in the hospital.  I told him that I had a headache and took too much aspirin.  He acted like he believed me, then said I was crazy for not knowing better.  I honestly don't know if he believes it, or if he knows the truth, and just refuses to bring it up. I literally told him what i was going to do 2 hours before. My mother called a few times while I was in the hospital.  My sister never called.  I felt even more alone and ignored than ever.  I tried suicide a few times after that. I took an entire package of caffeine pills. I just ended up in the hospital,  and I tried to pass it off as food poisoning.  The doctors gave me a toxic screen because my heart was racing.  Apparently they don't check for caffeine,  because it came back negative.  I tried to drown myself.  I once stood on the edge of a 6 story building,  wondering if it was high enough,  or if I was just going to hurt myself.  I was drinking vodka, trying to get my nerves up. I didn't jump, because I know someone who tried,  and survived,  they just weren't right after that. I didn't have access to a taller building.   I darted out in traffic.  The last time I thought about suicide,  I thought about a suicide hood.  I wanted a hood, and to make it airtight,  and have helium replace the oxygen.   It was supposed to be peaceful,  but for some reason,  I didn't go through with it.  Obviously,  I never told my family again,  even when they had to pick me up from the hospital. I told my family,  thinking they just didn't know how bad I felt, and they would tell me something to make me seem like I was overreacting,  and that I was cared about. Instead they showed me that me being unhappy,  was a personal affront to them.  That's how I saw it my entire life,  I was simply hoping that they would finally show me that wasn't the case.  They showed me that I was right all along and that they were well aware of what they were doing to me.  I didn't need to fo through that more than once.  If I wanted to die, they had no intention of showing me that they wanted me around.  They would rather me gone if I was going to be sad and cry.  I was fine for a while.  I went through bad times,  but I was living,  and making it through. All my desires to die, was tied to a relationship. All of them.  I was finally in a good place, alone.  Then someone came and my emotions peaked again.  I hare seeing people sad. It reminds me of all the times when I was sad, and no one would even attempt to help me through a dark period.  They just got mad that I was not happy,  and letting them know.  I know What it's like to go through a rough patch, and keep it to yourself.  I know for many, the homicidal and suicidal thoughts are there, unspoken to most, if not everyone.  I try to be there for everyone.  I feel physical pain, if I see someone in emotional pain,  and I don't try to be there. That's what I would have wanted. Everyone in my family always says how kind I am. Thay I always go out of my way for others.  If they see that,,why are they so cruel to me, when I need emotional support?   My dad can't be that to anyone.  My mom however,  is just that for my sister now that she's going through her trials. Why can't they see that I've always given so much,  because it's what I've always needed.  Why do people use me for things,  then cause me to need it myself?   I don't have a me in my life. I'm feeling that old feeling,  but it's different.  I don't think I will make it this time.   I'm trying to be strong.  I'm trying to keep going.  I have children.  For the first time in almost 15 years,  I told someone how I felt.  I tried to call my ex, just to ask him how he would react if I told him I felt like I wanted to die. I have a feeling he will yell at me and tell him to leave him alone. I told one of my younger children because she walked in whilei was crying uncontrollably.  I just told her that I think I'm breaking down, and that I can't take it anymore. She told her sister.  They came up to hug me.  That helped. I don't want to bother my oldest, but I decided to send her a text telling her that I'm breaking down.  I don't know how she will react. Even before this last bout of depression hit, I dreamt I jumped off of a bridge,  and I saw my daughter asking ""she's isn't stronger yet? I'm sure she just went for a swim,  she likes long walks. ""  In the dream I thought to myself,  she knows I can't swim,  plus the water burns.   Somehow I came to the conclusion that I dreamt about Tyre Sampson, because I had that bream about 24 hours before his death.  Now, I'm not so sure. I wasn't depressed then.

Some prick decided it would be a good idea to show them something that was not meant for them, and now everything is harder. 

The last thing I wanted was for them to worry. I care about them and I was hoping I could go without causing them anxiety. But they saw it and they were worrying all day.

Why can't this be easy? It already hurts enough doing this to my family. Friends knowing about it was the last thing I wanted and now I can't fucking do shit without them worrying.

I guess to introduce myself I’m currently 21 and just recently left the active-duty Army to attend college on an ROTC scholarship about 7 months ago. Prior to that, I was deployed to Afghanistan for about 10 months, it’s almost hard to even recall the person I used to be back then. I was so mentally strong and confident in myself and my purpose, ironically despite working 12 hour days seven days a week under constant threat of getting blown up I can’t remember a time when I was better off mentally like nothing in the world could stop me as I had a plan and was going to stick with it and if I did end up getting murked I was just fine with that too. I stayed pretty safe for the most part although I did have a pretty close call with a rocket that landed in a ditch on the hill below the building I worked in. It obviously scared the ever-living fuck out of me and everyone else but after like 20 minutes we were all laughing about how close that one was and how “if only the stupid guy had aimed higher, he would have got us”. The whole affair really only strengthened my resolve and made the return home that much better, getting back to the states was probably the best moment of my life even if it was right in the middle of COVID lol. 

I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to “flex” my great strength or anything I’m just trying to describe who I was then to who am I now as they aren’t even remotely the same person. Problems started to arise for me around 3 months after getting back after the novelty of being back home wore off. I started to experience this weird sense of dissociation and depressive episodes that would sometimes last for an hour to a day and then I would suddenly snap back to what I considered a “normal” state of mind. These normally entailed feelings of hopelessness and dread like something in my head just wasn’t ticking right and when it came to social situations it was like I was operating on a different frequency than everyone else like I could hear and understand them but there was no emotion behind the words. It was distracting but manageable at that point and I just chalked it up to being burned out at work and figured once I got off active duty and into college things would greatly improve. 

Fast forward to the first semester of college and unfortunately, things have not gone as I imagined. In terms of school and finances, I’m doing fine and everything is going according to plan externally but internally I seem to be slowly degrading bit by bit. The depressive episodes became more intense to the point where I would physically lock up, tighten my muscles, grind my teeth and it feels like my head is throbbing from all the negative thoughts. It is nearly impossible to sleep in this state thanks to the extreme anxiety but then I would wake up the next morning and feel fine, barely being able to remember how I felt the night before. The cycle never stopped though, and then the thoughts of “well if you just ended it this wouldn’t be a problem anymore” started to kick in and that’s when it really started to snowball downhill fast. 

At this point in time, it feels like I’m in this depressive state nearly all the time it’s only a matter of how bad it’s going to be today. The dissociative feelings have been cranked up to 11 and conversations just feel like emotionless formalities. I can no longer connect with friends and family the way I used to, like I said earlier it’s like we’re not on the same frequency if that makes any sense. The thoughts of suicide are ever-present and feel like a big red “emergency eject” button begging to be pressed. The only escape from these feelings are partying, drugs, and alcohol which are great temporarily but eventually everyone goes back to their lives, you sober up and reality slaps you in the face even harder than it did last time. I’ve also developed a very odd fear of human intimacy that I really can’t explain. For instance, I’m a virgin which is a huge insecurity of mine and pretty embarrassing I know, I always figured when I’m in college I’ll meet plenty of women so there’s no need to be insecure about it. However, I’ve had several instances where women have come onto me and I’m totally comfortable with the conversation and flirty talk but once it gets physical, even just them grabbing me it triggers this instant fear and panic response and I make up an excuse and leave in a manic state then beat myself up for the next 2 weeks about how much of a pussy I am. This is honestly one of the major contributors to my broken self-image.  

A couple of weeks ago I randomly started bawling in my car for over an hour and honestly don’t even remember why. I’m not eating much anymore maybe only like one meal a day and my cognitive performance/motivation has declined significantly. My sleep schedule is a total mess I’ll either sleep for 3 hours and wake up from nightmares in cold sweat or sleep for 14 and not want to get out of bed and face reality. What really prompted me to post this though was that last week I got really drunk and ended up putting a gun to my head without even thinking about it and then I realized what I was doing. That’s when I kind of told myself holy shit man this is real and something is very wrong with you. I need some kind of help I know but if I’m diagnosed with any kind of mental health condition, I’ll lose my scholarship and I’ve just worked too damn hard for it. I’ve openly told some of my close friends and family directly that I’m having suicidal thoughts but the response is always “oh c’mon man your way too strong for that” or “you’re just in a slump right now it’ll pass”. As much as I appreciate having people who care for me and appreciate the sentiment it doesn’t do much to alleviate anything. 

I feel like I was never meant to live this long and that that rocket was supposed to kill me that day but I’m living in some kind of an alternate reality where I survived and nothing makes sense anymore. At least then I could have died strong and confident rather than broken. I had a friend who was killed over there and honestly, I wish I could trade places with him, he deserves this life more than I do. 

Sorry, I turned this into an essay but it feels good to get this out of my head for once, if you read this long, I hope you can relate or at least get something out of it, and thank you. 

Finally, I’ll leave you with a song I’ve been listening to on repeat for the past week lmao.

,SuicideWatch,"
I'm not happy. On the surface I don't really look it either. I have no emotional energy to see my dying father and it hurts too much. He has a rare neurological disease that ate away his brain about 10 years ago, and he can now no longer speak   or swallow. After his attempted suicide he has no use of his legs and this has left me with unimaginable emotional pain. I'm constantly picturing what it felt like jumping from the multistorey car park down the road from me.  I warned my mother of his impending suicide when I was about 16 but she was too dumb to listen. He would ring us telling us he was gonna off himself. Show up at my college unannounced.. I told her to get the cats out of the house at least but my dad ended up killing them. For someone who loves cats it haunts me to this day... 

He would lash out at me and my brother when angry. It started with slaps when we were bad. I think I turned into a bad teenager and I started talking back to him. I phoned the police a few times...I would barricade myself in the room to avoid being hit. It was starting to get worse and it wasn't helped by the fact I talked back. The last time nefore we moved to my grandma's He broke my nose. He went after my mum and I said stop qnd he straight up punched me. Blood was everywhere. I am very sensitive and this has traumatised me. But nit as much as his suicide. I literally can't face him now that he can't speak. He can emote just about but he's stuck in his own body. It hurts even more knowing that he loves us. I wish he didn't because I didn't visit for 3 years at one point. I was told that he would stare at a picture of me and my brother all day. 

Janice who is my dad's sister has never failed to voice her disappointment at myself and my brother. I remember qfter my dad's first suicide attempt she was having a go at my mum. I went sick at her. Said some nasty things. She thinks that I should have got over what happened since I am an adult now. She just calls me out on everything. I just want someone's support. I feel torn apart. 

I want to live my life now qfter years of pain. My brother never arranges to see him. My mum has cut him out for good. I cant understand this and I know this is hypocritical. 

I am given a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. I could show symptoms the same time as my father or possibly earlier because the gene is more aggressive when passed from a male. I'm terrified however I have accepted my fate. I will shoot myself before I even get too bad. 

It sickens me to imagine my father laying there in pain with no way of expressing it. He literally sits there for hours stuck in his own body. I want to shoot him to put him out of his misery and then shoot myself. 

I am socially anxious qt work and I can't make friends. I went through a period of depression in school and got brain fog. This brain fog never left me. I cant link the trauma with the brain fog because I'm smart enough to know that not everything works like that. I lost my friends because I was so fucking weird and hostile. Now I don't trust other women and I act fucking weird around them because I don't want them to know the real me. In truth, I just want a friend. But myself is not good enough right now. 

I have my boyfriend but I'm not sure if he's right for me. He's a year older than me and we work together. He has been excellent at offering me support when needed however his actions have showed another story in the past. He gets very argumentative and I am really suspicious that he is a manipulative bad person holding me back in life. But I love him and I wouldn't have made it without his support. I also know that I could be wrong. I am so unsure about everything. He accuses me of getting too close to other men at work. And to be more aware of my surroundings etc. I could just be overthinking it 

I mean it when I say that I definitely have emotionally abusive qualities so I definitely can't tell if I am the problems or he is. 

The prospect of potentially having an alzheimers- like disease in my mid 30s is literally shitting on my progress in life. I was a talented child and now I am working in a crap warehouse slaving myself away. 

I have no sense of humour. Everything said to me I take too seriously. I am insanely sensitive to the point where I have left jobs over a minor disagreement. I do not think that it would take alot to push me over the edge. 

My body is ugly. My face is ugly. I spend 3 hours getting ready for work every day and I slap so much makeup on that I'm unrecognisable. I get attention when I do myself up but I got bullied in school when I wore no makeup. Go figure. 

I want a fulfilling life but I don't see any hope. I just crave love and friendship. I have done some bad things in my life and I am no angel. I feel about 35 when I am 24. 

I dont know where the fuck to go from here. 

I dont want my boyfriend to suffer when I chose to end my life. He wouldn't be able to handle what my mum and dad went through. He's got his own emotional baggage. 

I dont want to insult anyone on here because I know there are people going through FAR worse than me. I just know how sensitive I am and that my father's death is near. I will have to see him, plan a funeral with family members that hate me. I hope someone will have the energy to read this and guide me. There's alot more trauma to the story but my life is a blur, alot like what I have been writing about. 

Please excuse my lack of good grammar, I am tired after night shift and I can't be bothered to spellcheck. I have never put my story out there before.

On the surface I don&amp;#39;t really look it either. I have no emotional energy to see my dying father and it hurts too much. He has a rare neurological disease that ate away his brain about 10 years ago, and he can now no longer speak   or swallow. After his attempted suicide he has no use of his legs and this has left me with unimaginable emotional pain. I&amp;#39;m constantly picturing what it felt like jumping from the multistorey car park down the road from me.  I warned my mother of his impending suicide when I was about 16 but she was too dumb to listen. He would ring us telling us he was gonna off himself. Show up at my college unannounced.. I told her to get the cats out of the house at least but my dad ended up killing them. For someone who loves cats it haunts me to this day... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would lash out at me and my brother when angry. It started with slaps when we were bad. I think I turned into a bad teenager and I started talking back to him. I phoned the police a few times...I would barricade myself in the room to avoid being hit. It was starting to get worse and it wasn&amp;#39;t helped by the fact I talked back. The last time nefore we moved to my grandma&amp;#39;s He broke my nose. He went after my mum and I said stop qnd he straight up punched me. Blood was everywhere. I am very sensitive and this has traumatised me. But nit as much as his suicide. I literally can&amp;#39;t face him now that he can&amp;#39;t speak. He can emote just about but he&amp;#39;s stuck in his own body. It hurts even more knowing that he loves us. I wish he didn&amp;#39;t because I didn&amp;#39;t visit for 3 years at one point. I was told that he would stare at a picture of me and my brother all day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janice who is my dad&amp;#39;s sister has never failed to voice her disappointment at myself and my brother. I remember qfter my dad&amp;#39;s first suicide attempt she was having a go at my mum. I went sick at her. Said some nasty things. She thinks that I should have got over what happened since I am an adult now. She just calls me out on everything. I just want someone&amp;#39;s support. I feel torn apart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to live my life now qfter years of pain. My brother never arranges to see him. My mum has cut him out for good. I cant understand this and I know this is hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am given a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. I could show symptoms the same time as my father or possibly earlier because the gene is more aggressive when passed from a male. I&amp;#39;m terrified however I have accepted my fate. I will shoot myself before I even get too bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sickens me to imagine my father laying there in pain with no way of expressing it. He literally sits there for hours stuck in his own body. I want to shoot him to put him out of his misery and then shoot myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am socially anxious qt work and I can&amp;#39;t make friends. I went through a period of depression in school and got brain fog. This brain fog never left me. I cant link the trauma with the brain fog because I&amp;#39;m smart enough to know that not everything works like that. I lost my friends because I was so fucking weird and hostile. Now I don&amp;#39;t trust other women and I act fucking weird around them because I don&amp;#39;t want them to know the real me. In truth, I just want a friend. But myself is not good enough right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my boyfriend but I&amp;#39;m not sure if he&amp;#39;s right for me. He&amp;#39;s a year older than me and we work together. He has been excellent at offering me support when needed however his actions have showed another story in the past.

I have battled every day since I was 11, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, self worth.. I haven't self harmed in a year or so, which is the longest I've gone for any point of my conscious life. The only thing that's ever stopped me was having to use my body for work, but I'd cope in other ways, alcohol, drugs, whatever I could do to get me through. 

I am older now, I consider myself out of the industry, though I am doing outcalls rather than working at a brothel, I'd still be working there if I was allowed to tbh(covid work restrictions), but in a way I'm glad I can't. I am finding it harder and harder to live with the memories of what my life has been, all the cruel things that have been said and done. And having absolutely nobody to confide in, nobody I can trust, it's an incredibly lonely life.

I wish I had been smarter with my money, but when you're living that lifestyle time feels infinite, it feels like it will last forever, and you spend stupid amount of money on nothing because you know you'll make it back in 5 minutes. I so badly wish I'd been smarter, set myself up for my future, but now I have nothing, other than the memories, regrets. I did it all for nothing.

I feel like no matter how hard I work to find happiness, I just can't. I feel like I will never be able to let go of all the things that hurt, even though all I want is to be able to move on. Now I'm pregnant, and I'm so ashamed and am going to have to face doctors appointments, scans, the abortion, alone. Alone. When I imagine any another woman in that situation my heart breaks at the thought of her, my heart breaks for myself. I am so scared, and I am feeling the full gravity of how alone I truly am. 

I just want peace, I don't know how I can continue to exist, it feels impossible. I am overwhelmed, sure, but like all of us there is so much that I am not writing down, it's not as simple as find some support etc, there's so many complex situations I have tried tirelessly to navigate through and let go of, and I can't do it.
